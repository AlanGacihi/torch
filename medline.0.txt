TI  - [Damage effect of Polygonum multiflorum fractions on human normal liver cells L02
      and liver cancer cells HepG2].
PG  - 1830-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the damage effect of different fractions from Polygonum
      multiflorum on normal human liver and liver cancer cells, in order to seek for
      fractions that can obviously kill cancer cells but have less impact on normal
      liver cells, and make a preliminary study on different mechanism of the two kinds
      of cells. METHOD: P. multiflorum water-eluted fraction (RW), 50% ethanol-eluted
      fraction (R50) and 95% ethanol-eluted fraction (R95) were successively obtained
      from 70% ethanol extracts of P. multiflorum, after being eluted by water, 50%
      ethanol and 95% ethanol and then absorbed by AB-8 macroporous resin. Normal human
      liver L02 cells and liver cancer HepG2 cells were incubated with cell
      supernatants from different fractions and cells. MTT method and inverted
      microscope were adopted to observe the impact of L02 on growth of HepG2 cells,
      screening fractions with damage effect and detect their doses and time effect.
      Giemsa stain showed changes in cell nucleus after administration and flow
      cytometry analysis was used to detect cycle and apoptosis of L02 cells. RESULT:
      MTT method and inverted microscope showed that R50 had significant growth
      inhibition effects on L02 and HepG2 cells. According to giemsa stain and flow
      cytometry analysis, R50 showed different effect on inducing the two cells: there 
      are much more apoptotic HepG2 cells than apoptotic L02 cells in each time phase
      (the proportion of the apoptosis cells in HepG2 group were 83.62%, 60.52% and
      74.49%, and ID2 31.02%, 20.57% and 25.32% after treated with R50 for 24, 48, 72
      h. Both cells showed less than 5% of apoptotic cells in the negative control
      group in each time phase). However, there is no significant impact on cycle of
      both cells. CONCLUSION: R50 from P. multiflorum extracts had different damage
      effects on human liver L02 cells and liver cancer HepG2 cells, which was caused
      by different degree of induction on apoptosis of the two cells in nature.

PG  - 536-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differential expression of miR-21, miR-126, miR-143
      and miR-373 in normal cervical tissue, cervical cancer tissue and Hela cell.
      METHODS: The expressions of miR-21, miR-126, miR-143 and miR-373 were detected by
      real-time PCR in cervical cancer tissue, cervical tissue of benign uterine tumor 
      and Hela cell. RESULTS: High expression of miR-21 was observed in cervical cancer
      and Hela cell, while low expression was observed in normal cervical tissue. The
      relative quantification of miR-21 in cerveical cancer was 11.3196 times that of
      miR-21 in normal cervical tissue (P < 0.05). The expression levels of miR-143 and
      miR-373 in cervical cancer and Hela cell were lower than those of normal cervical
      tissue. The relative quantification of miR-143 in cerveical cancer was 0.1553
      times that of normal cervical tissue (P < 0.05), and the relative quantification 
      of miR-373 in cerveical cancer was 0.4907 times that of normal cervical tissue (P
      < 0.05). The expression of miR-126 had no significant difference among cervical
      cancer tissue, Hela cell and normal cervical tissue (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION:
      miRNAs are closely related to the occurrence and regulation of cervical cancer.
      The high expression of miR-21 in cervical cancer and Hela cell indicate that it
      may play a possible role of oncogenes, while miR-143 and miR-373 with low
      expression may play the role of tumor suppressor genes.

PG  - 584-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the value of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in early
      screening of lung cancer in high-risk group. METHODS: LDCT was performed in 1551 
      adults over 40-years old (male 1054, female 497) for the screening of lung cancer
      in Examination Center of West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and the
      subjects were divided into high-risk group and non-high-risk group according to
      risk factors of lung caner. The detection rates of lung lesion and lung cancer in
      these two groups were carefully analyzed. RESULTS: In the people over 40-years
      old,the detection rate of pulmonary lesions by LDCT was 54.41% (844/1551), the
      detection rate of nodules was 29.4% (456/1551). Detection rate of lung cancer was
      0.51% (8/1551), while it was 1.21% (7/577) in high-risk group, and 2.01% (6/298) 
      in heavy smoker group. The difference of lung cancer detection rate was
      significant (P < 0.05). When stratified with the number of risk factors, the
      detection rate of lung cancer by LDCT was 0.10% (1/974) in the subjects without
      any high-risk factors, 0.98% (5/506) in the subjects with one high-risk factor
      and 2.86% (2/70) in the subjects with more high-risk factors, and the differences
      were stastatically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: LDCT can detect
      asymptomatic lung cancer sensitively with low radiation dose, which could be
      helpful for the screening of lung cancer.

      for diagnosis of brain metastasis in lung cancer].
PG  - 601-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic efficacy of gadobutrol for assessing
      brain metastases in lung cancer patients in comparison with multihance. METHODS: 
      21 patients with lung cancer suspected of brain metastasis were enrolled in this 
      study. All patients underwent twice MRI scans on a 3.0T MRI scanner (Siemens
      MAGENETOM Trio) with 8-channel head coil, first with 0.5 mol/L multihance and
      then with 1.0 mol/L gadobutrol as contrast agent. The dosage of contrast agent
      was set at 0.1 mmol/kg body mass. The interval between the two scans was 24-72
      hours. The detection and delineation of lesions were evaluated visually. The
      signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) of lesion to normal 
      brain white matter and the percentage of lesion enhancement were calculated and
      compared between the two scans by 2 experienced neuroradiologists. RESULTS: One
      patient was excluded because he received radiation therapy between the two scans.
      15 patients were found to have brain metastases with a total of 35 lesions. There
      were no statistical differences between the two scans in SNR, CNR and percentage 
      enhancement for both normal brain and lesions (t = 0.545, P = 0.592; t = 1.143, P
      = 2.267; t = 0.592, P = 0.557; t = 0.473, P = 0.639). CONCLUSION: Half-dose
      gadobutrol (1.0 mol/L) can achieve the same enhancement effects compared with
      full-dose multihance (0.5 mol/L).

TI  - Hemangioblastic characteristics of cancer stem cells in chronic myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 607-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Overwhelming evidence from Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) research
      indicates that patients harbor quiescent CML stem cells that are responsible for 
      blast crisis. While the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) origin of CML was first
      suggested over 30 years ago, recently CML-initiating cells beyond HSCs are also
      being investigated. METHODS: Here we isolated fetal liver kinase-1-positive
      (Flk1+) cells from CML patients and we tested their biological characteristics.
      In addition, endothelial and hematopoietic differentiation assays were also
      performed to test their cancer stem cell ability. RESULTS: We found these cells
      expressed the BCR/ABL specific CML oncogene. Co-culture assay also indicated they
      could promote HSC blast colonies. Further studies showed they could differentiate
      not only into endothelial lineages but also into erythroid cells at the
      single-cell level. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal bone marrow-derived Flk1+CD34- multipotent 
      stem cells have the capacity for self-renewal and multilineage differentiation
      even after being expanded for more than 50 cell doublings, they might be the
      cancer stem cells and a target source in the treatment of CML.

TI  - Endogenous hormones in postmenopausal females with breast cancer--before and
      after treatment.
PG  - 771-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is usually present for many years (as long as 5-10
      years) before it can be clinically diagnosed (theory of the 'dormant malignant
      cell'). This implies that breast cancer cells, during their subclinical period,
      are likely to have been exposed for a considerable time to endogenous sex
      hormones and endogenous hormonal milieu predicts the chances of breast cancer in 
      females. So, we planned this study to evaluate the role of endogenous hormones in
      postmenopausal females excluding the patients on hormone replacement therapy as
      the relationship between breast cancer and hormone replacement therapy is well
      known. METHODS: Hormone therapy is known to affect these hormone levels but
      whether treatment of breast cancer per se also decreases the hormone levels is
      not known. We planned the present study to determine hormone levels in patients
      before and after 4 months of treatment (chemotherapy/surgery and radiotherapy).
      Circulating hormone levels were measured using a chemiluminescence method. Their 
      results were compared with a group of 25 age matched healthy controls. RESULTS:
      We found that serum prolactin, testosterone and estrogen levels were very
      significantly higher in patients before treatment (Group I) as compared to
      controls (Group III). Serum prolactin and serum estrogen levels were
      significantly higher and serum testosterone was very significantly higher in
      patients before treatment (Group I) when compared after 4 months of treatment
      (Group II). Only serum estrogen levels were significantly high in patients after 
      treatment (Group II) as compared to controls (Group III). Serum progesterone
      levels showed no significant difference to any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: We
      concluded that postmenopausal females with breast cancer have abnormalities in
      hormone levels. These abnormalities may be considered in the pathogenesis of the 
      disease and should be taken into account in the treatment of patients of breast
      cancer. It might also be helpful to delay the onset of cancer by normalizing the 
      levels of these hormones and in deciding the treatment modality for the patients 
      once breast cancer has been diagnosed but further studies are required to prove
      the benefit of measuring serum hormone levels as a screening test.

TI  - Vitamin D status from dried capillary blood samples.
PG  - 851-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the huge impact of vitamin D deficiency on a broad spectrum of 
      diseases such as rickets, osteoporosis, mineral bone disease-vascular
      calcification syndrome, infectious diseases, but also several types of cancer and
      CNS diseases, reliable and simple methods to analyze the vitamin D status are
      urgently needed. METHODS: We developed an easy technique to determine the 25-OH
      vitamin D status from dried blood samples on filter paper. This allows
      determination of the 25-OH vitamin D status independently of venous blood taking,
      since only sampling of capillary blood is required for this new method. We
      compared the results of vitamin D measurements from venous blood of 96 healthy
      blood donors with those from capillary blood taken from the same patients at the 
      same time. The capillary blood was dried on filter paper using the D-Vital ID
      dry-blood collection system. RESULTS: 25-OH vitamin D concentration data from
      extracted dried capillary blood filters correlated very well with data obtained
      after direct measurement of venous blood samples of the same blood donor (R:
      0.7936; p < 0.0001). The correlation was linear over the whole range of 25-OH
      vitamin D concentrations seen in this study. A Bland-Altman plot revealed good
      agreement between both tests. CONCLUSIONS: The D-Vital ID dry-blood collection
      system showed an excellent performance as compared to the classical way of 25-OH 
      vitamin D measurement from venous blood. This new technique will facilitate easy 
      and reliable measurement for vitamin D status, in particular, in rural or
      isolated areas, developing countries, and field studies.

PG  - 3552-61

AB  - Biodegradable hyperbranched polyglycerols (dHPGs) were synthesized through
      oxyanionic initiating hybrid polymerization of glycerol and glycidyl
      methacrylate. Due to the introduction of ester linkages into the hyperbranched
      polyglycerol backbone, dHPGs showed good biodegradability and low cytotoxicity.
      Benefiting from the existence of terminal hydroxyls and methacryloyl groups, both
      the anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX) and fluorescent probe Rhodamine-123 could 
      be conjugated onto the surface of dHPGs easily. The resultant MTX-conjugated
      polymers (dHPG-MTXs) exhibited an amphiphilic character, resulting in the
      formation of micelles in an aqueous solution. The release of MTX from micelles
      was significantly faster at mildly acidic pH of 5.0 compared to physiological pH 
      of 7.4. dHPG-MTX micelles could be efficiently internalized by cancer cells. MTT 
      assay against cancer cells showed dHPG-MTXs micelles had high anticancer
      efficacy. On the basis of their good biodegradability and low cytotoxicity, dHPGs
      provide an opportunity to design excellent drug delivery systems.

TI  - Melatonin and synthetic analogs as antioxidants.
PG  - 71-5
AB  - Recent studies suggest that overproduction of reactive oxygen and nitrogen
      species (ROS/RNS), lowered antioxidant defense of the body. Oxidative stress is
      damaging to DNA, lipids, proteins and many more vital macromolecules.
      Consequences of oxidative stress thought to contribute to the development of a
      wide range of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease,
      diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, neurodegeneration in motor neuron diseases and
      many cancer types. Melatonin (MLT) is a powerful antioxidant with a particular
      role in the protection of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. To find an improved
      antioxidant activity, developments of novel synthetic analogues are under
      investigation. These studies may offer a new progress and approach in antioxidant
      drug development as well as antioxidant chemistry. Therefore, we have been
      synthesizing novel MLT derivatives and investigating their antioxidant
      capacities. This review gives a brief knowledge about the MLT based analogue
      indole derivatives as potential antioxidants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High-throughput laboratory technologies coupled with sophisticated
      bioinformatics algorithms have tremendous potential for discovering novel
      biomarkers, or profiles of biomarkers, that could serve as predictors of disease 
      risk, response to treatment or prognosis. We discuss methodological issues in
      wedding high-throughput approaches for biomarker discovery with the case-control 
      study designs typically used in biomarker discovery studies, especially focusing 
      on nested case-control designs. METHODS: We review principles for nested
      case-control study design in relation to biomarker discovery studies and describe
      how the efficiency of biomarker discovery can be effected by study design
      choices. We develop a simulated prostate cancer cohort data set and a series of
      biomarker discovery case-control studies nested within the cohort to illustrate
      how study design choices can influence biomarker discovery process. RESULT:
      Common elements of nested case-control design, incidence density sampling and
      matching of controls to cases are not typically factored correctly into biomarker
      discovery analyses, inducing bias in the discovery process. We illustrate how
      incidence density sampling and matching of controls to cases reduce the apparent 
      specificity of truly valid biomarkers 'discovered' in a nested case-control
      study. We also propose and demonstrate a new case-control matching protocol, we
      call 'antimatching', that improves the efficiency of biomarker discovery studies.
      CONCLUSIONS: For a valid, but as yet undiscovered, biomarker(s) disjunctions
      between correctly designed epidemiologic studies and the practice of biomarker
      discovery reduce the likelihood that true biomarker(s) will be discovered and
      increases the false-positive discovery rate.

TI  - Perivesical fat invasion in bladder cancer: implications for prognosis comparing 
      pT2b, pT3a and pT3b stages and consequences for adjuvant chemotherapy
      indications.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Study Type--Therapy (retrospective cohort) Level of Evidence 2b.
      What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? The more that bladder
      cancer progresses from the urothelium to the outside of the bladder the worse the
      prognosis. To date, the use of adjuvant chemotherapy has not been completely
      defined. The present study clarifies the prognosis and benefits of adjuvant
      chemotherapy for different stages of bladder cancer that invade perivesical fat. 
      OBJECTIVE: * To assess the prognosis of pT2b, pT3a and pT3b bladder cancers after
      radical cystectomy (RC) in order to define potential situations where
      chemotherapy may be of benefit. PATIENTS AND METHODS: * Between 1985 and 2009,
      903 patients underwent a RC and pelvic bilateral lymphadenectomy in an
      Institutional Referral Centre. * In all, 87 patients (9.6%) had a pT2b tumour,
      111 patients (12.3%) a pT3a tumour, and 129 patients (14.3%) a pT3b tumour. * The
      median (range) overall follow-up was 23 (1-350) months. * Overall (OS),
      disease-specific (DSS), metastases-free (MFS) and local recurrence-free survival 
      (LRFS) was estimated and compared using Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank test.
      RESULTS: * The 5-year survivals pT2b and pT3a were similar for LRFS (86% vs 84%),
      MFS (69% vs 63%), DSS (72% vs 70%) and OS (66% vs 61%), and the prognosis was
      better than for pT3b stage tumours (69%, 44%, 40%, and 31% respectively). * In
      pN0 disease, MFS differences between pT2b-pT3a and pT3b tumours were not
      significant in patients who had received adjuvant chemotherapy (MSF of 87%, 69%
      and 56%, respectively) while they were significant in patients without adjuvant
      chemotherapy (MFS of 70%, 68% and 42%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: * Bladder
      cancers invading perivesical tissue macroscopically have a greater propensity to 
      produce lymph node metastases, local recurrence, and have lower MFS, DSS, and OS.
      In pN0 disease, pT3b tumours may receive more benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.
      * Our results could be a useful for selecting patients for adjuvant chemotherapy.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Study Type--Therapy (cohort) Level of Evidence 2b. What's known on
      the subject? and What does the study add? Radical prostatectomy was previously
      shown to improve long-term outcomes among men with clinically-detected prostate
      cancer. Our data suggests that radical prostatectomy is also associated with
      improved outcomes in men with screen-detected prostate cancer. OBJECTIVE: * To
      examine the long-term outcomes of radical prostatectomy (RP) among men diagnosed 
      with prostate cancer from the screening and control arms of the Rotterdam section
      of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: * Among 42,376 men randomised during the period of the
      first round of the trial (1993-1999), 1151 and 210 in the screening and control
      arms were diagnosed with prostate cancer, respectively. * Of these men, 420
      (36.5%) screen-detected and 54 (25.7%) controls underwent RP with long-term
      follow-up data (median follow-up 9.9 years). * Progression-free (PFS),
      metastasis-free (MFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates were examined, and
      multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether
      screen-detected (vs control) was associated with RP outcomes after adjusting for 
      standard predictors. RESULTS: * RP cases from the screening and control arms had 
      statistically similar clinical stage and biopsy Gleason score, although
      screen-detected cases had significantly lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
      levels at diagnosis. * Men from the screening arm had a significantly higher PFS 
      (P = 0.003), MFS (P < 0.001) and CSS (P = 0.048). * In multivariable models
      adjusting for age, PSA level, clinical stage, and biopsy Gleason score, the
      screening group had a significantly lower risk of biochemical recurrence (hazard 
      ratio [HR] 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-0.83, P = 0.011) and
      metastasis (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06-0.59, P = 0.005). * Additionally adjusting for
      tumour volume and other RP pathology features, there was no longer a significant 
      difference in biochemical recurrence between the screening and control arms. *
      Limitations of the present study include lead-time bias and non-randomised
      treatment selection. CONCLUSIONS: * After RP, screen-detected cases had
      significantly improved PFS, MFS and CSS compared with controls within the
      available follow-up time. * The screening arm remained significantly associated
      with lower rates of biochemical recurrence and metastasis after adjusting for
      other preoperative variables. * However, considering also RP pathology, the
      improved outcomes in the screening group appeared to be mediated by a
      significantly lower tumour volume.

      allowing different machineries to activate or silence the transcription of genes 
      governed by various epigenetic events. Epigenetic modifications and dynamic
      changes in chromatin organization by organizer proteins have recently been shown 
      to play an instrumental role in regulating cancer-promoting genes. Special
      AT-rich binding protein (SATB1) is a unique type of global regulator that
      integrates higher-order chromatin organization with regulation of gene
      expression. Aberrant expression of SATB1 has been shown to promote breast,
      hepatocellular, prostate and various other cancers. In this review we highlight
      upon the role of SATB1in chromatin organization and as global regulator of gene
      expression during cancer development. The expression of SATB1 progressively
      increases with the progression of cancers and it dynamically reprograms the
      expression of genes that are involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. SATB1
      directly regulates the expression of ERRB2, MMP2, ABL1, E-cadherin and hence acts
      as key regulator in cancer development. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of
      regulation of SATB1 expression would therefore be extremely essential towards
      designing strategies to control it. Recent studies have provided important
      insights into regulation of SATB1 by FOXP3 and microRNAs. In this review we
      evaluate the potential of SATB1 as molecular target for cancer therapy.

TI  - The retinoblastoma protein: functions beyond the G1-S regulator.
PG  - 1622-32
AB  - Retinoblastoma protein (pRB) is functionally inactivated in a large number of
      tumors including retinoblastoma, osteosarcoma, small-cell lung carcinoma, as well
      as bladder, breast and prostate cancers. The best known role of pRB in preventing
      cancer is inhibition of cell cycle progression by controlling the exit from the
      cell cycle into G0/G1. In addition, increasing evidence has suggested that pRB
      has important roles in DNA replication during S phase and G2/M transition. The
      tumor suppressor function of pRB has also been demonstrated by directly promoting
      differentiation via cell cycle exit with specific gene expression. Inactivation
      of pRB function during these cell cycle phases leads to dysregulated cell
      proliferation and/or chromosomal instability, which are strongly linked to cancer
      development. Thus pRB plays important roles through multiple functions in
      determining cell fate, i.e., normal growth/death and differentiation, or tumor
      formation. Therapeutic intervention by reactivation of pRB function would be
      expected to be an effective treatment against various cancers.

TI  - Telemedicine for rural cancer care in North Queensland: bringing cancer care
      home.
PG  - 259-64
LID - 10.1111/j.1440-1584.2012.01299.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of telemedicine in cancer care (teleoncology model
      of care) for rural patients in North Queensland. DESIGN: This is a descriptive
      study. Data on demographical and clinical factors were retrieved from the
      teleoncology database of Townsville Hospital and review of medical records for
      the period between May 2007 and May 2011. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The medical
      oncologists at the Townsville Cancer Centre, a regional cancer centre in North
      Queensland, have been providing their services to rural hospitals in Townsville
      and Mt Isa districts via videoconferencing since 2007. INTERVENTION: Cancer care 
      delivery to rural sites via Townsville teleoncology model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      The ability of the teleoncology model to provide the following services to rural 
      towns: (i) specialist consultations; (ii) urgent specialist medical care; (iii)
      care for Indigenous patients; and (iv) remote supervision of chemotherapy
      administration. RESULTS: Between May 2007 and May 2011, 158 patients from 18
      rural towns received a total of 745 consultations. Ten of these patients were
      consulted urgently and treatment plans initiated locally, avoiding interhospital 
      transfers. Eighteen Indigenous patients received consultative services, being
      accompanied by more than four to six family members. Eighty-three patients
      received a range of intravenous and oral chemotherapy regimens in Mt Isa and oral
      agents in other towns through remote supervision by medical oncologists from
      Townsville. CONCLUSION: Teleoncology model of care allows rural and Indigenous
      cancer patients to receive specialist consultations and chemotherapy treatments
      closer to home, thus minimising the access difficulties faced by the rural
      sector.

AB  - PROBLEM: Townsville Cancer Centre provides video-consultation (VC) services to
      patients in rural/remote regions of North Queensland in order to improve access
      to specialist cancer care. The experience and responses of indigenous patients
      using this service have not been studied. Our objective is to assess the level of
      satisfaction and the responses of Indigenous patients, their families and health 
      workers (HWs) to VC and such teleoncology service. DESIGN: Descriptive study,
      using semistructured interviews. SETTING: Tertiary referral centre (Townsville
      Cancer Centre) and various rural and remote towns in Queensland. KEY MEASURES FOR
      IMPROVEMENT: Satisfaction levels of Indigenous patients, their family members and
      Indigenous HWs with various aspects of the teleoncology service. LESSONS LEARNT: 
      Our evaluation suggests that teleoncology is an acceptable model of care for
      Indigenous patients, with high levels of satisfaction expressed from patients,
      families and HWs. Health professionals involved with providing this service need 
      to be adaptive to the needs of individual patients and local communities in order
      to provide culturally appropriate care. Formal skills training for staff,
      effective communication between specialist and local HWs, and informed consent
      procedures are essential to maintain safety of practices. Strategies for change
      are: * Mandatory informed consent procedure for all patients offered with VC. *
      Formalised competency training for staff in skills essential to maintain safe
      practices in teleoncology. * Clear clinical documentation to facilitate improved 
      communication in patient management between medical staff at main centre and
      distant sites. * Further efforts in promotion, education and support for staff to
      participate in telemedicine.

TI  - Risk of thyroid cancer among chernobyl liquidators.
PG  - 425-36
LID - 10.1667/RR2975.1 [doi]
AB  - After the Chernobyl accident in 1986, the "liquidators" or clean-up workers were 
      among those who received the highest radiation doses to the thyroid from external
      radiation. Some were also exposed to radioiodines through inhalation or
      ingestion. A collaborative case-control study nested within cohorts of
      Belarusian, Russian and Baltic liquidators was conducted to evaluate the
      radiation-induced risk of thyroid cancer. The study included 107 cases and 423
      controls. Individual doses to the thyroid from external radiation and from
      iodine-131 ((131)I) were estimated for each subject. Most subjects received low
      doses (median 69 mGy). A statistically significant dose-response relationship was
      found with total thyroid dose. The Excess Relative Risk (ERR) per 100 mGy was
      0.38 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.10, 1.09]. The risk estimates were similar 
      when doses from (131)I and external radiation were considered separately,
      although for external radiation the ERR was not statistically significantly
      elevated. The ERR was similar for micro carcinomas and larger size tumors, and
      for tumors with and without lymph node involvement. Although recall bias and
      uncertainties in doses could have affected the magnitude of the risk estimates,
      the findings of this study contribute to a better characterization the risk of
      thyroid cancer after radiation exposure in adulthood.

TI  - Patients who take their symptoms less seriously are more likely to have
      colorectal cancer.
PG  - 130
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-12-130 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: People vary in how they respond to symptoms. The purpose of this
      study was to assess whether serious disease is more likely to be present in
      patients who report that they take any symptoms less seriously than other people 
      do, and to assess the reliability of a question which can be used to identify the
      extent to which patients take any symptom seriously. To do this we assessed
      whether the likelihood of detecting colorectal cancer is higher in patients who
      report that they take symptoms less seriously than other people do. METHODS:
      Cross sectional study of 7736 patients who had colonoscopy to find colorectal
      cancer. Before colonoscopy, patients completed a questionnaire on bowel symptoms 
      and were also asked: "Compared to other people of your age and sex, how seriously
      do you think you take any symptoms?" Likelihood of detecting colorectal cancer
      according to responses to this question was assessed by logistic regression
      models, unadjusted and adjusted for symptoms and other known predictors of
      colorectal cancer.Question reliability was assessed in a different sample using
      percentage agreement and the kappa statistic for the answers given by each
      patient on two occasions. Agreement between patient and doctor responses was also
      assessed (n = 108). RESULTS: Patients who reported they took symptoms less
      seriously were 3.28 (95%CI: 2.02, 5.33) times more likely to have colorectal
      cancer than patients who took symptoms more seriously than others. The effect was
      smaller (1.85 (95%CI: 1.11, 3.09)), but remained statistically significant in
      models including symptoms and other predictors of colorectal cancer. The question
      was reliable: on repeat questioning, 70% of responses were in absolute agreement 
      and 92% were within 1 category, kappa 57%. Patient-doctor agreement was 66%,
      within 1 category 92%, kappa 48%. CONCLUSION: Patients who take their symptoms
      less seriously have a considerably higher likelihood of colorectal cancer than
      those who identify themselves as taking any symptoms more seriously than other
      people. The question is easy to ask and has good reliability. Doctors also
      reliably identify how patients assess themselves. Assessment of how seriously
      patients take any symptoms can contribute to the clinical assessment of a
      patient.

TI  - Postoperative vomiting in pediatric oncologic patients: prediction by a fuzzy
      logic model.
PG  - 68-73
LID - 10.1111/pan.12000 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a fuzzy logic mathematical model to predict postoperative
      vomiting (POV) in pediatric oncologic patients and compare with preexisting
      scores. BACKGROUND: Although POV has a high incidence in children and may
      decrease parental satisfaction after surgeries, there is only one specific score 
      that predicts POV in children: the Eberhart's score. In this study, we report a
      fuzzy model that intends to predict the probability of POV in pediatric oncologic
      patients. Fuzzy logic is a mathematical theory that recognizes more than simple
      true and false values and takes into account levels of continuous variables such 
      as age or duration of the surgery. The fuzzy model tries to account for
      subjectiveness in the variables. METHODS: Preoperative potential risk factors for
      POV in 198 children (0-19 year old) with malignancies were collected and
      analyzed. Data analysis was performed with the chi-square test and logistic
      regression to evaluate probable risk factors for POV. A system based on fuzzy
      logic was developed with the risk factors found in the logistic regression, and a
      computational interface was created to calculate the probability of POV. RESULTS:
      The model showed a good performance in predicting POV. After the analysis, the
      model was compared with Eberhart's score in the same population and showed a
      better performance. CONCLUSIONS: The fuzzy score can predict the chance of POV in
      children with cancer with good accuracy, allowing better planning for
      postoperative prophylaxis of vomiting. The computational interface is available
      for free download at the internet and is very easy to use.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Abstract Background and Purpose: Topical chemotherapy for urothelial 
      cancer is dependent on adequate contact time of the chemotherapeutic agent with
      the urothelium. To date, there has not been a reliable method of maintaining this
      contact for renal or ureteral urothelial carcinoma. We evaluated the safety and
      feasibility of using a reverse thermosensitive polymer to improve dwell times of 
      mitomycin C (MMC) in the upper tract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a porcine
      model, four animals were treated ureteroscopically with both upper urinary tracts
      receiving MMC mixed with iodinated contrast. One additional animal received MMC
      percutaneously. The treatment side had ureteral outflow blocked with a reverse
      thermosensitive polymer plug. MMC dwell time was monitored fluoroscopically and
      intrarenal pressures measured. Two animals were euthanized immediately, and three
      animals were euthanized 5 days afterward. RESULTS: In control kidneys, drainage
      occurred at a mean of 5.3+/-0.58 minutes. Intrarenal pressures stayed fairly
      stable: 9.7+/-14.0 cm H20. In treatment kidneys, dwell time was extended to 60
      minutes, when the polymer was washed out. Intrarenal pressures in the treatment
      kidneys peaked at 75.0+/-14.7 cm H20 and reached steady state at 60 cm H20.
      Pressures normalized after washout of the polymer with cool saline. Average
      washout time was 11.8+/-9.6 minutes. No histopathologic differences were seen
      between the control and treatment kidneys, or with immediate compared with
      delayed euthanasia. CONCLUSIONS: A reverse thermosensitive polymer can retain MMC
      in the upper urinary tract and appears to be safe from our examination of
      intrarenal pressures and histopathology. This technique may improve the efficacy 
      of topical chemotherapy in the management of upper tract urothelial carcinoma.

      of Wnt/beta-catenin and endothelin-1 signaling.
PG  - 1566-80

AB  - Our current knowledge about drug transporters in the maturational brain is very
      limited. In this study, we provide a comprehensive overview of the expression and
      activity profile of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), Breast Cancer Resistance Protein
      (bcrp), Organic Anion Transporter 3 (oat3), and Transporting Peptide 1a4
      (oatp1a4) transporters during blood-brain barrier (BBB) maturation. Gene and
      protein expressions of the analyzed transporters increase as the brain matures,
      with no variation in their activity for P-gp and bcrp, while the transport
      activity of oat3 and oatp1a4 increases during brain maturation from preterm up to
      adulthood. For the first time, we illustrate a downregulation of nuclear
      beta-catenin expression in brain capillaries when bcrp, P-gp, oat3, and oatp1a4
      transporters are at their highest expression levels. In vivo activation of
      beta-catenin in rat brains, by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of a GSK-3
      inhibitor, enhances the activity of P-gp, bcrp, oat3, and oatp1a4. Interestingly,
      in an in vitro BBB model consisting of a coculture of primary endothelial brain
      cells with astrocytes or in vivo, activation of beta-catenin enhances the mRNA
      expression of ET-1. Interestingly, blocking the ETA receptor for endothelin-1 in 
      vivo by ICV injection of a ETA antagonist decreases transporter activity mediated
      by the activation of beta-catenin. These findings shed light on the role of an
      interaction between beta-catenin and endothelin-1 signaling in the regulation of 
      these transporters at the BBB.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Success of HBV vaccines in reducing the incidence of liver cancer, 
      and HPV vaccines in reducing preneoplastic cervical lesions, demonstrate the
      potential of cancer reduction by harnessing the immune system. For most human
      cancers, infectious etiology is not known but other tumor antigens, candidates
      for vaccines, have been identified. AREAS COVERED: The authors discuss knowledge 
      accumulated the last two decades on the tumor antigen MUC1 that has put it at the
      top of the list as an immunotherapy reagent. They examine evidence that anti-MUC1
      immunity affects tumor development and prognosis. Finally, they review two
      decades of immunotherapy trials targeting MUC1, focusing primarily on vaccines
      but also adoptive antibody and T-cell therapies. EXPERT OPINION: Most approaches 
      targeting MUC1 have been immunotherapies administered to date to more than 1200
      patients in clinical trials. Even though these trials focused on advanced cancer,
      encouraging results were reported particularly for less immunosuppressed
      patients. Furthermore, spontaneous anti-MUC1 immune responses are associated with
      better prognosis or with a reduced lifetime risk of developing MUC1+ cancers.
      MUC1 is abnormally expressed in over 80% of all cancers. Successfully targeting
      this molecule could benefit over a million patients diagnosed yearly with MUC1+
      tumors just in the USA.

PG  - 1010-6
LID - 10.3109/0284186X.2012.721932 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report two year clinical outcomes of image guided radiation therapy
      (IGRT) to the vaginal cuff and pelvic lymph nodes in a series of high-risk
      endometrial cancer patients. METHODS: Twenty-six consecutive high-risk
      endometrial cancer patients requiring adjuvant radiation to the vaginal cuff and 
      regional lymph nodes were treated with vaginal cuff fiducial-based IGRT.
      Seventeen (65%) received sequential chemotherapy, most commonly with a sandwich
      technique. Brachytherapy followed external radiation in 11 patients to a median
      dose of 18 Gy in 3 fractions. The median external beam dose delivered was 47.5 Gy
      in 25 fractions. RESULTS: All 656 fractions were successfully imaged and treated.
      The median overall translational shift required for correction was 9.1 mm
      (standard deviation, 5.2 mm) relative to clinical set-up with skin tattoos.
      Shifts of 1 cm, 1.5 cm, and 2 cm or greater were performed in 43%, 14%, and 4% of
      patients, respectively. Acute grade 2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity occurred in 
      eight patients (30%) and grade 3 toxicity occurred in one. At two years, there
      have been no local or regional failures and actuarial overall survival is 95%.
      CONCLUSION: Daily image guidance for high-risk endometrial cancer results in a
      low incidence of acute GI/genitourinary (GU) toxicity with uncompromised tumor
      control at two years. Vaginal cuff translations can be substantial and may
      possibly result in underdosing if not properly considered.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is considered one of the
      most common skin malignancy with a relatively high risk of metastasis occurrence.
      AREAS COVERED: We discuss the pathogenetic mechanisms of cSCC and the main
      therapeutic strategies available for the treatment of cSCC. EXPERT OPINION:
      Chemotherapy and biological therapy with Interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) and cis
      retinoic acid are active but give limited results. Recently, strategies based on 
      the use of molecularly target-based agents (MTA) have been used with promising
      results. Based on the available findings, we hypothesize that SCC cells can
      develop survival and resistance mechanisms to MTAs. The detection of these
      mechanisms could be useful in designing strategies able to overcome the latter
      and to potentiate the anticancer activity of MTAs. We describe the example of the
      EGF-dependent survival pathway elicited by IFN-alpha and the different strategies
      to abrogate this survival pathway. Other strategies to potentiate the antitumor
      activity of cytotoxic agents such as docetaxel or cisplatin are also discussed.
      Illuminating examples are the inhibition of multichaperone activity or the
      inactivation of the proteasome. In conclusion, a new dawn based upon the
      rationale use of MTAs is rising up in the treatment of advanced cSCC.

TI  - Down-modulation of expression, or dephosphorylation, of IG20/MADD in tumor
      necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-resistant thyroid cancer cells 
      makes them susceptible to treatment with this ligand.
PG  - 70-8
LID - 10.1089/thy.2012.0155 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The IG20/MADD gene is overexpressed in thyroid cancer tissues and
      cell lines, and can contribute to tumor necrosis factor-related
      apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) resistance. The ability of the MADD protein to 
      resist TRAIL-induced apoptosis is dependent upon its phosphorylation by Akt.
      Interestingly, while TRAIL induces a significant reduction in the levels of
      phospho-Akt (pAkt) and phospho-MADD (pMADD) in TRAIL-sensitive cells, it fails to
      do so in TRAIL-resistant cells. In this study, we investigated if MADD
      phosphorylation by Akt was contributing to TRAIL resistance in thyroid cancer
      cells. METHODS: We determined the susceptibility of different thyroid cancer cell
      lines to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
      analysis. We tested for various TRAIL resistance factors by FACS analyses or for 
      IG20/MADD expression by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain
      reaction. We determined the levels of pAkt and pMADD upon TRAIL treatment in
      thyroid cancer cells by Western blotting. We tested if down-modulation of
      IG20/MADD gene expression using shRNA or phosphorylation using a dominant
      negative Akt (DN-Akt) or pretreatment with LY294002, a PI3 kinase inhibitor,
      could help overcome TRAIL resistance. RESULT: BCPAP and TPC1 cells were
      susceptible, while KTC1 and FTC133 cells were resistant, to TRAIL-induced
      apoptosis. The differential susceptibility to TRAIL was not related to the levels
      of expression of death receptors, decoy receptors, or TRAIL. KTC1 and FTC133
      cells showed higher levels of IG20/MADD expression relative to BCPAP and TPC1,
      and were rendered susceptible to TRAIL treatment upon IG20/MADD knockdown.
      Interestingly, upon TRAIL treatment, the pAkt and pMADD levels were reduced in
      TRAIL-sensitive BCPAP and TPC1 cells, while they remained unchanged in the
      resistant KTC1 and FTC133 cells. While expression of a constitutively active Akt 
      in BCPAP and TPC1 cells rendered them resistant to TRAIL, pretreating KTC1 and
      FTC133 cells with LY294002 rendered them TRAIL-sensitive. Moreover, expression of
      a DN-Akt in KTC1 and FTC133 cells reduced the levels of pAkt and pMADD and
      sensitized them to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Our results show that
      pMADD is an important TRAIL resistance factor in certain thyroid cancer cells and
      suggest that down-modulation of either IG20/MADD expression or phosphorylation
      can render TRAIL-resistant thyroid cancer cells sensitive to TRAIL.

AB  - Chemical addressability of viral particles has played a pivotal role in adapting 
      these biogenic macromolecules for various applications ranging from medicine to
      inorganic catalysis. Cowpea mosaic virus possesses multiple features that are
      advantageous for the next generation of virus-based nanotechnology: consistent
      multimeric assemblies dictated by its genetic code, facile large scale
      production, and lack of observable toxicity in humans. Herein, the chemistry of
      the viral particles is extended with the use of Cu-free strain-promoted
      azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction, or SPAAC reaction. The elimination of Cu,
      its cocatalyst and reducing agent, simplifies the reaction scheme to a more
      straightforward approach, which can be directly applied to living systems. As a
      proof of concept, the viral particles modified with the azadibenzylcyclooctyne
      functional groups are utilized to trigger and amplify a weak fluorescent signal
      (azidocoumarin) in live cell cultures to visualize the non-natural sugars. Future
      adaptations of this platform may be developed to enhance biosensing applications.

PG  - 1303-23

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Initially studied for its central role in the pathogenesis of
      chronic diabetic complications, aldose reductase (ALR2) gains more attention over
      the years as its implication in inflammatory diseases is being established, along
      with the therapeutic potential of its inhibitors. AREAS COVERED: Reviewing the
      patents that were published since 2006, it is getting clear that the search for
      new chemical entities has subsided, giving rise to natural products and plant
      extracts with ALR2 inhibitory activity. Other aspects that were prominent were
      the search for proper forms of known inhibitors, in a way to improve their
      impaired physicochemical profile, as well as potential combination therapies with
      other compounds of pharmaceutical interest. On the spotlight were patents
      enhancing the therapeutic usage of aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) to various 
      pathological conditions including cancer and inflammation-mediated diseases such 
      as sepsis, asthma, and cancer. EXPERT OPINION: Although new chemical entities are
      scarcely registered and patented after many years of inconclusive clinical
      trials, the involvement of ALR2 to inflammatory pathologies might renew the
      interest in the field of ARIs.

TI  - Preclinical models for pediatric solid tumor drug discovery: current trends,
      challenges and the scopes for improvement.
PG  - 1093-106
LID - 10.1517/17460441.2012.722077 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The enhancement in pediatric cancer survival achieved in the past
      few decades has been confined to low- and moderate-risk cancers, whereas no
      notable improvement in survival was observed in high-risk and advanced-stage
      childhood cancers. High attrition rate of candidate drugs in clinical trials is a
      major hurdle in the development of effective therapies for pediatric solid
      tumors. In order to reduce the failure rate of candidate drugs in clinical
      trials, more effective strategies are needed to enhance the predictability of
      preclinical testing. AREAS COVERED: The authors have described the current trends
      in preclinical drug development for treating pediatric solid tumors. Furthermore,
      the authors review their limitations and the available remedies, with regards to 
      choice of models, pharmacokinetic considerations and the criteria for assessing
      the long-term efficacy of a candidate drug. EXPERT OPINION: In many solid tumors,
      common differences between pediatric and adult cancers have been observed, and
      therefore, clinical trials for pediatric solid tumors must be conducted on the
      basis of preclinical observations in pediatric solid tumor models. There is a
      need to invest in extensive preclinical testing on pediatric solid tumor models. 
      None of the preclinical models can fully recapitulate the human cancers.
      Therefore, these limitations must be considered while conducting a preclinical
      trial. The dose and schedule of drugs used for preclinical testing must be
      clinically relevant. While testing the efficacy of drugs, the markers of
      apoptosis, drug resistance, hypoxia and tumor-initiating cells can inform us
      about the long-term therapeutic response of a cancer.

TI  - Chemistry and pharmacology of imexon and related cyanoaziridines.
PG  - 5745-53
AB  - Following the demonstration that addition of a 2-cyano group to aziridines
      prevented DNA alkylation and thus reduced toxicity, many novel 2-cyanoaziridines 
      were synthesized and evaluated as immunomodulating and antitumor agents. They
      typically reacted with thiols such as cysteine, depleting them and allowing the
      accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Two of these compounds, azimexon and
      ciamexon, showed activity against tumors in clinical trials. Imexon was produced 
      by cyclization of 2-cyanoaziridine-1- carboxamide in the presence of hydroxide
      ions. The two enantiomers were prepared by a process involving chiral
      chromatography. They were equipotent against cultured tumor cells. Imexon also
      reacts with thiols and it is especially potent against multiple myeloma in cell
      cultures. An efficient chemical synthesis and a lyophilization formulation of
      imexon as a water soluble, injectible drug, were developed. In Phase I and I/II
      clinical trials imexon showed hints of activity against a variety of tumors, but 
      a randomized double-blind Phase II trial of imexon plus gemcitabine versus
      gemcitabine alone in pancreatic cancer showed no enhancement of activity above
      that of gemcitabine alone. This result was disappointing because in cell culture 
      and mice the two compounds were synergistic. Based on a complete response in a
      Phase I trial, a new Phase II clinical trial of imexon is underway in
      non-Hodgkins lymphoma.

      cancer cells.
PG  - 419
LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-12-419 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer remains the deadliest of all cancers, with a
      mortality rate of 91%. Gemcitabine is considered the gold chemotherapeutic
      standard, but only marginally improves life-span due to its chemical instability 
      and low cell penetrance. A new paradigm to improve Gemcitabine's therapeutic
      index is to administer it in nanoparticles, which favour its delivery to cells
      when under 500 nm in diameter. Although promising, this approach still suffers
      from major limitations, as the choice of nanovector used as well as its effects
      on Gemcitabine intracellular trafficking inside pancreatic cancer cells remain
      unknown. A proper elucidation of these mechanisms would allow for the elaboration
      of better strategies to engineer more potent Gemcitabine nanotherapeutics against
      pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Gemcitabine was encapsulated in two types of commonly
      used nanovectors, namely poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and
      cholesterol-based liposomes, and their physico-chemical parameters assessed in
      vitro. Their mechanisms of action in human pancreatic cells were compared with
      those of the free drug, and with each others, using cytotoxity, apoptosis and
      ultrastructural analyses. RESULTS: Physico-chemical analyses of both drugs showed
      high loading efficiencies and sizes of less than 200 nm, as assessed by dynamic
      light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), with a drug
      release profile of at least one week. These profiles translated to significant
      cytotoxicity and apoptosis, as well as distinct intracellular trafficking
      mechanisms, which were most pronounced in the case of PLGem showing significant
      mitochondrial, cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum stresses. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      study demonstrates how the choice of nanovector affects the mechanisms of drug
      action and is a crucial determinant of Gemcitabine intracellular trafficking and 
      potency in pancreatic cancer settings.

TI  - Efficacy of multidrug superselective intra-arterial chemotherapy (docetaxel,
      cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil) using the Seldinger technique for tongue cancer.
PG  - 1108-14
AB  - CONCLUSION: This therapy produced better results than intravenous multidrug
      chemotherapy (CF therapy, CPF therapy, etc.) or superselective intra-arterial
      chemotherapy (SIC) alone with cisplatin (CDDP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Primary
      tumor may be controlled by SIC alone in cases of T2 and many cases of T3 tumors, 
      and by the combination of SIC and concurrent radiotherapy in cases of T3 and many
      cases of T4a. Cervical lymph node metastasis was treated with neck dissection in 
      some patients. The results indicate that this therapy is useful to control
      primary tumor without resection for organ preservation. OBJECTIVES: This therapy 
      was intended to control primary tumor without resection for better quality of
      life (QOL). METHODS: A total of 45 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma 
      of the tongue were included in the study. SIC with docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-FU
      was administered. RESULTS: In terms of the primary response of primary tumor, 43 
      patients achieved a clinical complete response (CR). Moreover, in these patients 
      no cancer cells were histopathologically found by biopsy, resulting in a response
      rate of 100% and a CR rate of 95.6%. During the median follow-up period of 1779
      days (59 months) (range 110-3752 days), the 5-year survival rate and organ
      preservation rate were 89.8% and 80.7%, respectively.

TI  - Flavonoids acting on DNA topoisomerases: recent advances and future perspectives 
      in cancer therapy.
PG  - 5287-93
AB  - Flavonoids, secondary metabolites ubiquitously produced in the plant kingdom, are
      low molecular weight polyphenolic molecules. They are characterized by variable
      chemical structures and show a vast array of biological activities (i.e...
      antiviral, antiinflammatory, antitumor, antimicrobial, estrogenic,
      antiestrogenic, antioxidant, mutagenic and antimutagenic) targeting different
      pathways. Some of these compounds such as Genistein, Daidzein or its synthetic
      derivative Phenoxodiol as well as Luteolin and Quercetin are able to inhibit DNA 
      topoisomerases. This review discusses that Flavonoids targeting DNA
      topoisomerases may lead to novel drug development with anticancer potential.

TI  - High incidence of skin cancer in the Channel Islands.
PG  - 239-43
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2230.2012.04480.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies looking at rates of malignant melanoma (MM) and
      nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in the UK have documented one of the highest rates
      in the southwest of England; however, the incidence of these tumours in Guernsey 
      and Jersey, two of the Channel Islands, has not previously been reported. AIMS:
      To determine the incidence of cutaneous MM and NMSC in the Channel Islands.
      METHODS: Data for the period 2005-2009 were obtained from clinical and
      histopathological records for all MMs excised in the Channel Islands, and from
      the South-west Cancer Registry for MMs excised in the southwest of England and
      for NMSCs in both areas. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASRs) per 100,000
      of the population in the Channel Islands were compared with those with the
      southwest of England, the UK and the rest of Europe where available. The MM
      characteristics of the Channel Islands were then compared with the southwest of
      England using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). RESULTS: The ASR/100,000 for 
      cutaneous MM for 2005-2009 was 30 for the Channel Islands (31.3 for Jersey, 28.2 
      for Guernsey), 20.3 for the southwest of England, and 15.6 for the UK. Comparison
      with the rest of Europe indicated that the incidence of MM in the Channel Islands
      is one of the highest in Europe. The highest incidence of MM was in the over 65
      years age group on both Guernsey and Jersey, and when divided into 5-year age
      bands, the 70-74 years age group had the highest rate. This suggests that this
      particular age group may have previously received greater exposure to some
      environmental factor that promotes MM development. The ASR/100,000 for NMSC was
      also higher for the Channel Islands (263.3) than for the southwest of England
      (174.6) for 2005-2009, and for the UK in 2009 (104.9). CONCLUSIONS: This study
      indicates that the Channel Islands have a high incidence of skin cancer (both MM 
      and NMSC). In addition, the data show that the ASRs in older people in this
      population group differ from those in mainland UK, showing higher rates in the
      over 65 years age group.

PG  - 98-113
LID - 10.1111/cmi.12034 [doi]
AB  - Epidemiological evidence links chronic bacterial infections to the increased
      incidence of certain types of cancer but the molecular mechanisms by which
      bacteria contribute to tumour initiation and progression are still poorly
      characterized. Here we show that chronic exposure to the genotoxin cytolethal
      distending toxin (CDT) of Gram-negative bacteria promotes genomic instability and
      acquisition of phenotypic properties of malignancy in fibroblasts and colon
      epithelial cells. Cells grown for more than 30 weeks in the presence of sublethal
      doses of CDT showed increased mutation frequency, and accumulation of chromatin
      and chromosomal aberrations in the absence of significant alterations of cell
      cycle distribution, decreased viability or senescence. Cell survival was
      dependent on sustained activity of the p38 MAP kinase. The ongoing genomic
      instability was associated with impaired activation of the DNA damage response
      and failure to efficiently activate cell cycle checkpoints upon exposure to
      genotoxic stress. Independently selected sublines showed enhanced
      anchorage-independent growth as assessed by the formation of colonies in
      semisolid agarose. These findings support the notion that chronic infection by
      CDT-producing bacteria may promote malignant transformation, and point to the
      impairment of cellular control mechanisms associated with the detection and
      repair of DNA damage as critical events in the process.

TI  - Hypoxic enhancement of exosome release by breast cancer cells.
PG  - 421
LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-12-421 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exosomes are nanovesicles secreted by tumour cells which have roles
      in paracrine signalling during tumour progression, including tumour-stromal
      interactions, activation of proliferative pathways and bestowing
      immunosuppression. Hypoxia is an important feature of solid tumours which
      promotes tumour progression, angiogenesis and metastasis, potentially through
      exosome-mediated signalling. METHODS: Breast cancer cell lines were cultured
      under either moderate (1% O2) or severe (0.1% O2) hypoxia. Exosomes were isolated
      from conditioned media and quantitated by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA)
      and immunoblotting for the exosomal protein CD63 in order to assess the impact of
      hypoxia on exosome release. Hypoxic exosome fractions were assayed for miR-210 by
      real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and normalised to
      exogenous and endogenous control genes. Statistical significance was determined
      using the Student T test with a P value of < 0.05 considered significant.
      RESULTS: Exposure of three different breast cancer cell lines to moderate (1% O2)
      and severe (0.1% O2) hypoxia resulted in significant increases in the number of
      exosomes present in the conditioned media as determined by NTA and CD63
      immunoblotting. Activation of hypoxic signalling by dimethyloxalylglycine, a
      hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) hydroxylase inhibitor, resulted in significant
      increase in exosome release. Transfection of cells with HIF-1alpha siRNA prior to
      hypoxic exposure prevented the enhancement of exosome release by hypoxia. The
      hypoxically regulated miR-210 was identified to be present at elevated levels in 
      hypoxic exosome fractions. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that hypoxia 
      promotes the release of exosomes by breast cancer cells, and that this hypoxic
      response may be mediated by HIF-1alpha. Given an emerging role for tumour
      cell-derived exosomes in tumour progression, this has significant implications
      for understanding the hypoxic tumour phenotype, whereby hypoxic cancer cells may 
      release more exosomes into their microenvironment to promote their own survival
      and invasion.

PG  - 1161-74

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a high profile drug target for cancer 
      therapeutics due to their indispensable role in cancer progression, maintenance
      and therapeutic resistance. Restoring wild-type (WT) p53 function is an
      attractive new therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer due to the
      well-described powerful tumor suppressor function of p53. As emerging evidence
      intimately links p53 and stem cell biology, this approach also provides an
      opportunity to target CSCs. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the therapeutic
      approaches to restore the function of WT p53, cancer and normal stem cell biology
      in relation to p53 and the downstream effects of p53 on CSCs. EXPERT OPINION: The
      restoration of WT p53 function by targeting p53 directly, its interacting
      proteins or its family members holds promise as a new class of cancer therapies. 
      This review examines the impact that such therapies may have on normal and CSCs
      based on the current evidence linking p53 signaling with these populations.

TI  - Topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage and mutagenesis activated by nitric oxide 
      underlie the inflammation-associated tumorigenesis.
PG  - 1129-40
LID - 10.1089/ars.2012.4620 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Both cancer-suppressing and cancer-promoting properties of reactive
      nitrogen and oxygen species (RNOS) have been suggested to play a role in tumor
      pathology, particularly those activities associated with chronic inflammation.
      Here, we address the impact of nitric oxide (NO) on the induction of DNA damage
      and genome instability with a specific focus on the involvement of topoisomerase 
      II (TOP2). We also investigate the contribution of NO to the formation of skin
      melanoma in mice. RESULTS: Similar to the TOP2-targeting drug, etoposide (VP-16),
      the NO-donor, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), induces skin melanomas formation in
      7,12-dimethyl- benz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-initiated mice. To explore the
      mechanism(s) underlying this NO-induced tumorigenesis, we use a co-culture model 
      system to demonstrate that inflamed macrophages with inducible NO synthase (iNOS)
      expression cause gamma-H2AX activation, p53 phosphorylation, and chromosome DNA
      breaks in the target cells. Inhibitor experiments revealed that NO and TOP2
      isozymes are responsible for the above described cellular phenotypes. Notably,
      NO, unlike VP-16, preferentially induces the formation of TOP2beta cleavable
      complexes (TOP2betacc) in cells. Moreover, GSNO induced TOP2-dependent DNA
      sequence rearrangements and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the incidences of GSNO-
      and VP-16-induced skin melanomas were also observed to be lower in the
      skin-specific top2beta-knockout mice. Our results suggest that TOP2 isozymes
      contribute to NO-induced mutagenesis and subsequent cancer development during
      chronic inflammation. INNOVATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first
      experimental evidence for the functional role of TOP2 in NO-caused DNA damage,
      mutagenesis, and carcinogenesis. Notably, these studies contribute to our
      molecular understanding of the cancer-promoting actions of RNOS during chronic
      inflammation.

TI  - A small RNA derived from RNA coactivator SRA blocks steroid receptor signaling
      via inhibition of Pus1p-mediated pseudouridylation of SRA: evidence of a novel
      RNA binding domain in the N-terminus of steroid receptors.
PG  - 8163-72
LID - 10.1021/bi300602r [doi]
AB  - Estrogen receptors (ERs) and androgen receptors (ARs) are important targets for
      cancer therapy; however, the efficacy of receptor antagonists is limited, and
      alternative strategies are needed. Steroid receptor RNA Activator (SRA) is a
      long, noncoding RNA coactivator (although some protein-encoding 5' splice
      variants have also been reported) that requires pseudouridylation by Pus1p to
      stimulate steroid receptor signaling. A uridine at position 206 (U206), which is 
      located in small hairpin structure STR5 in the conserved SRA core sequence, is a 
      critical target for pseudouridylation. We assessed if synthetic STR5 could serve 
      as a novel competitive inhibitor of ERalpha and AR signaling by disrupting the
      Pus1p-SRA-steroid receptor axis. STR5 specifically inhibited Pus1p-dependent
      pseudouridylation of SRA with higher efficiency than STR5 mutant U206A. We show
      that SRA binds to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of ERalpha and AR with high
      affinity despite the absence of a recognizable RNA binding motif (RBM). Finally, 
      we show that STR5 specifically inhibits ERalpha- and AR-dependent transactivation
      of target genes in steroid-sensitive cancer cells, consistent with disruption of 
      the targeted Pus1p-SRA pathway. Together, our results show that the NTD of
      ERalpha and AR contains a novel RBM that directly binds SRA, and that STR5 can
      serve as a novel class of RNA inhibitor of ERalpha and AR signaling by
      interfering with Pus1p-mediated SRA pseudouridylation. Targeting this unexplored 
      receptor signaling pathway may pave the way for the development of new types of
      cancer therapeutics.

TI  - Prostaglandin reductase 2 modulates ROS-mediated cell death and tumor
      transformation of gastric cancer cells and is associated with higher mortality in
      gastric cancer patients.

AB  - Various prostanoids and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
      (PPARgamma) ligands play an important role in gastric cancer. Previously, we
      demonstrated that prostaglandin reductase 2 (PTGR2) catalyzes the reduction of
      the PPARgamma ligand 15-keto-PGE(2) into 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE(2). Here, we
      present functional data and clinical relevance for the role of PTGR2 in gastric
      cancer. Using lentiviral technology in AGS and SNU-16 gastric cancer cell lines, 
      we either down-regulated or overexpressed PTGR2. In vitro analysis showed that
      PTGR2 knockdown resulted in decreased proliferation rate and colony formation,
      and in vivo xenograft models showed slower growth of tumors. Mechanistically,
      PTGR2 knockdown induced cell death, altered mitochondrial function, and increased
      reactive oxygen species production, which led to activation of ERK1/2 and caspase
      3, with increased Bcl-2 and suppressed Bax expression. PTGR2 overexpression
      showed the opposite outcomes. Clinically, immunopathological staining showed
      strong PTGR2 expression in the gastric tumor portion, relative to nearby nontumor
      portions, and its expression negatively correlated with survival of patients with
      intestinal-type gastric cancer. Finally, in contrast to PTGR2-overexpressing
      cells, PTGR2-knockdown cells were more sensitive to cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil.
      Taken together, our findings not only provide functional and mechanistic evidence
      of the involvement of PTGR2 in gastric cancer, but also provide clinical
      observations affirming the significance of PTGR2 in gastric cancer and suggesting
      that PTGR2-target based therapy is worth further evaluation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The BRAF(V600E) mutation is present in 62% of radioactive
      iodine-resistant thyroid tumors and is associated with downregulation of the
      sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) and thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHr). We
      sought to evaluate the combined effect of BRAF inhibition and TSH supplementation
      on (131)I uptake of BRAF(V600E)-mutant human thyroid cancer cells. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: WRO cells (a BRAF(V600E)-mutant follicular-derived papillary thyroid
      carcinoma cell line) were transfected with small interfering RNA targeting BRAF
      for 72 h in a physiological TSH environment. NIS and TSHr expression were then
      evaluated at three levels: gene expression, protein levels, and (131)I uptake.
      These three main outcomes were then reassessed in TSH-depleted media and media
      supplemented with supratherapeutic concentrations of TSH. RESULTS: NIS gene
      expression increased 5.5-fold 36 h after transfection (P = 0.01), and TSHr gene
      expression increased 2.8-fold at 24 h (P = 0.02). NIS and TSHr protein levels
      were similarly increased 48 and 24 h after transfection, respectively.
      Seventy-two hours after BRAF inhibition, (131)I uptake was unchanged in
      TSH-depleted media, increased by 7.5-fold (P < 0.01) in physiological TSH media, 
      and increased by 9.1-fold (P < 0.01) in supratherapeutic TSH media. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The combined strategy of BRAF inhibition and TSH supplementation results in
      greater (131)I uptake than when either technique is used alone. This represents a
      simple and feasible approach that may improve outcomes in patients with
      radioactive iodine-resistant thyroid carcinomas for which current treatment
      algorithms are ineffective.

TI  - Association of catalase genotype with oxidative stress in the predication of
      colorectal cancer: modification by epidemiological factors.
PG  - 156-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to assess the interaction between common variations in
      catalase (CAT) polymorphic gene and environmental factors for antioxidant defense
      enzyme in modulating individual susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CRC).
      METHODS: A case-control study with 880 colorectal cancer cases and 848 controls
      was conducted to investigate whether variations in the catalase (CAT) gene, one
      of the genes involved in scavenging oxidative stress, influenced susceptibility
      to CRC. RESULTS: The interaction between life style and genotypes as well as with
      their effects on colorectal cancer was deduced from the present study.
      Significant difference (P = 0.01) was identified in the distribution of CAT
      genotype between the colorectal cancer cases and the controls. The CRC cases had 
      significantly lower mean activity than the controls (P < 0.01). Correlation
      analyses revealed statistically significant correlations between CAT activity and
      CAT genotype (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The risk of CRC was associated with smoking,
      low vegetable consumption, high pork and poultry consumptions, and low or high
      BMI. This is the first study reporting an association of polymorphism CAT-21A > T
      with colorectal cancer. Low CAT activity was associated with an increased risk of
      CRC; however, no evidence was found to support an association between CAT-21A > T
      polymorphism and CRC risk.

AB  - The advent of antibody-based cancer therapeutics has led to the concomitant rise 
      in the development of companion diagnostics for these therapies, particularly
      nuclear imaging agents. A number of radioisotopes have been employed for
      antibody-based PET and SPECT imaging, notably (6)(4)Cu, (1)(2)(4)I, (1)(1)(1)In, 
      and (99m)Tc; in recent years, however, the field has increasingly focused on
      (8)(9)Zr, a radiometal with near ideal physical and chemical properties for
      immunoPET imaging. In the review at hand, we seek to provide a comprehensive
      portrait of the current state of (8)(9)Zr radiochemical and imaging research,
      including work into the production and purification of the isotope, the synthesis
      of new chelators, the development of new bioconjugation strategies, the creation 
      of novel (8)(9)Zr-based agents for preclinical imaging studies, and the
      translation of (8)(9)Zr-labeled radiopharmaceuticals to the clinic. Particular
      attention will also be dedicated to emerging trends in the field, (8)(9)Zr-based 
      imaging applications using vectors other than antibodies, the comparative
      advantages and limitations of (8)(9)Zr-based imaging compared to that with other 
      isotopes, and areas that would benefit from more extensive investigation. At
      bottom, it is hoped that this review will provide both the experienced
      investigator and new scientist with a full and critical overview of this exciting
      and fast-developing field.

TI  - Diagnostic performance of PCA3 to detect prostate cancer in men with increased
      prostate specific antigen: a prospective study of 1,962 cases.

AB  - PURPOSE: The detection of prostate cancer relies primarily on abnormal digital
      rectal examination or increased serum prostate specific antigen concentration.
      However, low positive predictive values result in many men with increased
      prostate specific antigen and/or suspicious digital rectal examination having a
      negative biopsy. We investigated the value of the PCA3 (prostate cancer gene 3)
      urine test in predicting the likelihood of diagnosis of cancer before biopsy.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective, community based clinical trial
      to evaluate PCA3 score before any biopsy. This trial was conducted at 50 urology 
      practices in the United States. Samples were obtained from 1,962 men with
      increased serum prostate specific antigen (greater than 2.5 ng/ml) and/or
      abnormal digital rectal examination before transrectal prostate needle biopsy.
      Study samples (urinary PCA3 and biopsies) were processed and analyzed by a
      central laboratory. Sensitivity-specificity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: A
      total of 1,913 urine samples (97.5%) were adequate for PCA3 testing. Of 802 cases
      diagnosed with prostate cancer 222 had high grade prostatic intraepithelial
      neoplasia or atypical small acinar proliferation and were suspicious for cancer, 
      whereas 889 cases were benign. The traditional PCA3 cutoff of 35 reduced the
      number of false-positives from 1,089 to 249, a 77.1% reduction. However,
      false-negatives (missed cancers) increased significantly from 17 to 413, an
      increase of more than 2,300%. Lowering the PCA3 cutoff to 10 reduced the number
      of false-positives 35.4% and false-negatives only increased 5.6%. CONCLUSIONS:
      Urinary PCA3 testing in conjunction with prostate specific antigen has the
      potential to significantly decrease the number of unnecessary prostate biopsies.

TI  - Stepwise description and outcomes of bladder neck sparing during robot-assisted
      laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.

LID - S0022-5347(12)04224-3 [pii]
AB  - PURPOSE: While bladder neck sparing may improve post-prostatectomy urinary
      continence, there is concern that it may lead to more positive surgical margins
      and compromise cancer control. We compared the continence and cancer control
      outcomes of bladder neck sparing vs nonsparing techniques during robot-assisted
      laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were
      prospectively collected on 1,067 robot-assisted laparoscopic radical
      prostatectomies done from September 2005 through October 2011. We compared the
      procedures according to bladder neck sparing (791) and nonsparing (276).
      Continence was defined by zero pad responses on the EPIC (Expanded Prostate
      Cancer Index) item quantifying daily use. Biochemical recurrence was defined as
      prostate specific antigen 0.1 ng/ml or greater. Cox regression was performed to
      assess factors associated with post-prostatectomy continence and biochemical
      recurrence-free survival. RESULTS: Median followup for bladder neck sparing vs
      nonsparing was 25.8 vs 51.7 months. Men treated with bladder neck sparing were
      more likely to have clinical T1c tumors (p <0.001) and less likely to have biopsy
      Gleason grade 6 or less disease (p = 0.023). They experienced fewer urinary leaks
      (p = 0.009) and shorter length of stay (p = 0.006). Regarding cancer control
      outcomes, there was no difference in bladder neck sparing vs nonsparing base
      (1.2% vs 2.6%, p = 0.146) and overall surgical margin positivity (each 13.8%, p =
      0.985). On adjusted analyses bladder neck sparing vs nonsparing was associated
      with better continence (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.43-1.99) and similar biochemical
      recurrence-free survival (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.62-2.31, p = 0.596). CONCLUSIONS:
      Bladder neck sparing is associated with fewer urinary leak complications, shorter
      hospitalization and better post-prostatectomy continence without compromising
      cancer control compared to bladder neck nonsparing.

AB  - PURPOSE: We compared the prognostic ability of the current American Joint
      Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system to direct measurement of the depth of
      tumor invasion into the muscularis propria and perivesical fat. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: We identified 148 patients with pT2N0 and 206 with pT3N0 who underwent
      radical cystectomy between 1990 and 2003. Clinicopathological features were
      reviewed. A measurement in mm was recorded of the depth of tumor invasion into
      the muscularis propria for pT2 cases and into perivesical fat for pT3 cases.
      Cancer specific survival between the pT2a and pT2b, and the pT3a and pT3b patient
      groups was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log rank
      test. Optimal cutoff points for invasion depth in mm were estimated using an
      iterative estimation process to find the minimum p value with the maximum HR.
      RESULTS: Of 148 patients with pT2 bladder cancer, including 76 with pT2a and 72
      with pT2b, and 206 with pT3 bladder cancer, including 144 with pT3a and 62 with
      pT3b, there was no significant difference in cancer specific survival between the
      substages (p = 0.94 and 0.37, respectively). However, patients with measured
      invasion less than 4.5 mm into perivesical fat had significantly improved cancer 
      specific survival compared to that in patients with invasion 4.5 mm or greater
      (5-year cancer specific survival 53% vs 40%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: We found no 
      significant difference in cancer specific survival when pT2 and pT3 tumors were
      stratified by AJCC substage. However, for pT3 tumors direct measurement of the
      depth of tumor invasion into perivesical fat identified a significant
      stratification of cancer specific survival at 4.5 mm.

AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated the long-term outcome of patients with biochemical
      recurrence following radical prostatectomy with adjuvant radiation therapy and
      determined predictors of systemic progression in these men. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: We identified 134 men with biochemical recurrence following radical
      prostatectomy plus adjuvant radiation therapy for pT(any)N0M0 disease. Median
      followup was 13.1 years. Survival after biochemical recurrence was estimated
      using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard regression models were
      used to analyze clinicopathological variables associated with systemic
      progression after biochemical recurrence. RESULTS: Overall, 41 patients (31.5%)
      with biochemical recurrence experienced systemic progression and 57 (42.5%) died,
      including 19 (14.2%) of prostate cancer. Median systemic progression-free and
      cancer specific survival were not attained at 15 years of followup after
      biochemical recurrence. Median time from prostatectomy to recurrence was 3.3
      years. Ten-year cancer specific survival was not significantly different for
      patients who experienced biochemical recurrence less and greater than 3.3 years
      after radical prostatectomy (83% and 83%, respectively, p = 0.39). Moreover, on
      multivariate analysis increased pathological Gleason score (HR 1.78, p = 0.02)
      and rapid prostate specific antigen doubling time (less than 6-month doubling
      time HR 11.39, p <0.0001) were significantly associated with the risk of systemic
      progression. CONCLUSIONS: The natural history of biochemical recurrence after
      radical prostatectomy plus adjuvant radiation therapy is heterogeneous with only 
      a minority of these men experiencing systemic progression and death from prostate
      cancer. The decision to begin additional therapies in such patients must balance 
      the risk of disease progression, based on pathological Gleason score and
      postoperative prostate specific antigen doubling time, against the cost and
      morbidity of treatment.

TI  - Contrast enhanced transrectal ultrasound for the detection of prostate cancer: a 
      randomized, double-blind trial of dutasteride pretreatment.

LID - S0022-5347(12)04200-0 [pii]
AB  - PURPOSE: The identification of clinically significant disease is crucial for
      optimal treatment of prostate cancer. Selective detection of prostate cancer with
      increased microvessel density is possible with contrast enhanced ultrasound.
      Preliminary studies suggest that pretreatment with a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor
      may improve the efficiency of contrast enhanced ultrasound targeted biopsy. This 
      study was designed to quantify prostate cancer detection with contrast enhanced
      ultrasound with or without short-term pretreatment with dutasteride. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of oral
      dutasteride pretreatment, contrast enhanced ultrasound findings were graded and
      used to direct targeted biopsy (up to 6 cores per prostate). A blinded 12-core
      systematic biopsy was subsequently performed on every subject based on standard
      medial and lateral sampling of each sextant. RESULTS: Of 311 subjects who
      underwent randomization, 272 completed participation. Positive biopsies were
      obtained in 276 of 3,264 (8.5%) systematic cores and 203 of 1,237 (16.4%)
      targeted cores (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.7-2.6, p <0.001). ROC analysis for the detection
      of all prostate cancers demonstrated an increase in diagnostic accuracy from
      pre-contrast imaging to contrast enhanced ultrasound (A(z) 0.60 vs 0.64, p =
      0.005). For the detection of high grade cancer (Gleason score 7 or greater) ROC
      analysis demonstrated improved accuracy for pre-contrast imaging (A(z) 0.74) and 
      contrast enhanced ultrasound (A(z) 0.80, p = 0.0005). For the detection of high
      grade cancer with greater than 50% biopsy core involvement, excellent accuracy
      was demonstrated with pre-contrast and contrast enhanced ultrasound, A(z) 0.83
      and 0.90, respectively (p = 0.001). Pretreatment with dutasteride had no
      significant impact on the detection of prostate cancer (p = 0.97). CONCLUSIONS:
      Contrast enhanced ultrasound targeted biopsy provides a significant benefit for
      the detection of high grade/high volume prostate cancer.

AB  - PURPOSE: The Gleason scoring system has been the traditional basis for studies on
      the assessment and treatment of prostate cancer. Recent reports of long-term
      prostate cancer outcomes stratified by Gleason score based on the 2005 ISUP
      (International Society of Urological Pathology) update suggest that important
      aspects of the biology of prostate cancer correlate with commonly available
      histopathological information. In this review we present a conceptual framework
      for the possible existence of distinct but interrelated developmental pathways in
      the context of the Gleason score in considering various biological and clinical
      aspects of prostate cancer. This may be useful in characterizing prostate cancer 
      as an indolent condition in some and an aggressive disease in others, in decision
      making for treatment, and in the interpretation of the biological course and
      treatment outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive review of clinical,
      pathological and investigational biological literature on this topic was
      conducted. In addition, the biological behavior of prostate cancer as interpreted
      from this survey was compared to that of other solid neoplasms in developing a
      schema for characterizing the pathogenesis of various forms of the disease.
      RESULTS: The Gleason scoring system has been found to have fundamental value in
      predicting the behavior of prostate cancer and assessing outcomes of its
      treatment. Increasingly, the proportion of Gleason pattern 4 in a prostatectomy
      specimen is being recognized as a critical factor in predicting the rates of
      biochemical recurrence and prostate cancer specific mortality. Under the current 
      Gleason classification, a Gleason 3 + 3 = 6 cancer carries a minimal long-term
      risk of progression or mortality. Risk of biochemical recurrence and prostate
      cancer specific mortality increases with increasing proportions of the Gleason 4 
      component in the prostatectomy specimen, from 3 + 3 = 6 with tertiary 4 (ie less 
      than 5% of a 4 component) to 3 + 4 = 7, 4 + 3 = 7 and 4 + 4 = 8. Assuming that
      the Gleason 4 component increases in volume more rapidly with time than well
      differentiated components, it can be inferred that a smaller proportion of
      Gleason 4 could mean that the cancer has been identified at an earlier phase in
      the natural history of the disease. This could explain the improved prognosis on 
      the basis of length and lead time biases, and conceivably on the basis of a
      decreased likelihood of cancer cells having metastasized. Correspondingly,
      increasing amounts of Gleason 4 cancer in a prostate specimen might be explained 
      in 2 ways, as the preferential growth of a single clone of Gleason 4 cells,
      possibly with intraprostatic spread, or the evolution of Gleason 3 cancer cells
      to become Gleason 4. These hypotheses have been examined by genetic analysis of
      metastatic deposits and by comparisons of multiple foci of cancer within
      individual prostates. The clinical significance of these concepts in regard to
      disease status at diagnosis, treatment selection, outcomes of treatment, and
      implications for future research on the basis of clinical and molecular
      observations are the basis of the developmental schemata we propose. CONCLUSIONS:
      Given the relatively benign nature of homogeneous, low volume Gleason 3 tumors,
      and the progressive risk of biochemical recurrence and prostate cancer specific
      mortality with increasing quantities of Gleason 4 components, we propose that
      Gleason 4 (and 5) cancers constitute cancer diatheses distinct from that of
      Gleason 3 cancer. This distinction may contribute to the understanding of the
      prognosis intrinsic to these biological behavioral patterns, and help guide the
      translation of findings at molecular and histological levels to a more precise
      selection of treatments.

AB  - Necrotizing myopathies (MN) are defined by a specific histological pattern. They 
      are characterized by a predominant muscle fibre necrosis and regeneration but
      with little or no associated inflammation. This histological pattern is observed 
      in acquired myopathy but also in muscular dystrophy. Acquired NM can be secondary
      to drugs or toxics, and if not, autoimmune mechanisms have to be suspected.
      Necrotizing autoimmune myopathy is recognized as a subgroup of idiopathic
      inflammatory myopathies, different from other myositides. Generally, patients
      present a rapidly progressive and severe symmetrical proximal weakness with high 
      serum creatine kinase level, associated in some patients with cardiac
      involvement. On the other hand, a slower progression may sometimes be observed,
      that could lead to erroneous diagnosis of muscular dystrophy. Necrotizing
      autoimmune myopathy may be associated to specific autoantibodies against signal
      recognition particle, or more recently described, against
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. Necrotizing auto-immune myopathy
      can also be described in association with connective tissue diseases such as
      lupus or sclerodermia. In remaining cases, cancer association may be observed.
      Necrotizing autoimmune myopathies are now considered as a new entity, treatable
      by immunosuppressants and which should not be misdiagnosed as a muscular
      dystrophy.

AB  - Personalized oncology is evidence-based, individualized medicine that delivers
      the right care to the right cancer patient at the right time and results in
      measurable improvements in outcomes and a reduction on health care costs.
      Evolving topics in personalized oncology such as genomic analysis, targeted
      drugs, cancer therapeutics and molecular diagnostics will be discussed in this
      review. Biomarkers and molecular individualized medicine are replacing the
      traditional "one size fits all" medicine. In the next decade the treatment of
      cancer will move from a reactive to a proactive discipline. The essence of
      personalized oncology lies in the use of biomarkers. These biomarkers can be from
      tissue, serum, urine or imaging and must be validated. Personalized oncology
      based on biomarkers is already having a remarkable impact. Three different types 
      of biomarkers are of particular importance: predictive, prognostic and early
      response biomarkers. Tools for implementing preemptive medicine based on genetic 
      and molecular diagnostic and interventions will improve cancer prevention.
      Imaging technologies such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Positron Emitted
      Tomography (PET) are already influencing the early detection and management of
      the cancer patient. Future advances in imaging are expected to be in the field of
      molecular imaging, integrated diagnostics, biology driven interventional
      radiology and theranostics. Molecular diagnostics identify individual cancer
      patients who are more likely to respond positively to targeted chemotherapies.
      Molecular diagnostics include testing for genes, gene expression, proteins and
      metabolites. The use of companion molecular diagnostics is expected to grow
      significantly in the future and will be integrated into new cancer therapies a
      single (bundled) package which will provide greater efficiency, value and cost
      savings. This approach represents a unique opportunity for integration, increased
      value in personalized oncology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biliary tract cancer presents a poor prognosis. AIMS: The objective
      of this study is to find clinical-laboratory parameters like prognostic factors
      to select patients who can benefit from surgery and post-operative treatments.
      METHODS: Between 2005 and 2010, 41 patients underwent radical surgery at our
      Institution. A novel score was retrospectively calculated assigning a grade to
      the clinical-laboratory findings at diagnosis. 0 and 1 point were respectively
      assigned to the normal or abnormal parameter. Two groups were identified: SCORE 0
      and SCORE 1. RESULTS: Patients with cholangiocarcinoma or Klatskin tumours or
      asymptomatic at diagnosis presented a significantly better overall survival (OS) 
      than patients with different primary sites or who presented pain, jaundice or
      cholangitis. At univariate analysis, high levels of aspartate aminotransferase,
      alanine aminotransferase and CA19-9 before surgery, hyperbilirubinemia before and
      after surgery had a negative correlation with OS. A worse OS was observed in
      patients with a higher score (median OS in the "score 0" group=30.79 months vs.
      median OS in the "score 1"=17.98 months). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that
      pre and post-surgery clinical-laboratory parameters and the novel score, could be
      useful, especially for intrahepatic tumours, in predicting the outcome in
      patients undergoing surgery and in selecting patients to receive adjuvant
      therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Colon carcinogenesis is associated with increased expression levels
      of Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4. AIM: To determine in a
      Caucasian population the role of Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4
      polymorphisms in colorectal cancer development. METHODS: Hospital based
      multicentre case control study involving 193 colorectal cancer patients and 278
      healthy individuals. DNA samples were extracted from blood cells and genotyping
      of TLR2+597T>C, TLR2-4760T>C, TLR4-3745A>G, TLR2Arg753Gln, TLR4Asp299Gly was
      performed. Functionality of risk polymorphisms was evaluated through production
      of TNF-alpha in cell culture and Toll-like receptors levels quantified by
      real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: TLR2+597CC homozygous had 5-fold decreased risk (odds 
      ratio (OR)=0.21, 95% CI: 0.09-0.50, p<0.001) and TLR4 299Gly homozygous 3-fold
      increased risk of colorectal cancer (OR=3.30, 95% CI: 1.18-9.28, p=0.015). In
      stratified analysis, TLR2+597CC genotype protective effect was even higher in
      overweight individuals (OR=0.17, 95% CI: 0.06-0.53, p<0.001) and in never smokers
      (OR=0.11, 95% CI: 0.02-0.51, p=0.001). Also, the increased risk effect for TLR4
      299Gly homozygous genotype was higher in overweight individuals (OR=8.67, 95% CI:
      1.11-87.85, p=0.011). TLR2+597T>C polymorphism conferred 41% less (p=0.03) and
      TLR4Asp299Gly 65% more TNF-alpha production (p=0.02) with no differences in
      Toll-like receptors levels. CONCLUSION: Functional Toll-like receptor 2 and
      Toll-like receptor 4 polymorphisms significantly alter the risk to have
      colorectal cancer. Obesity and smoking may influence the risk for colorectal
      cancer in individuals presenting these genetic profiles.

AB  - Few descriptions of miliary brain metastases have been reported. We report the
      case of an adenocarcinoma of the lung associated with metachronous miliary brain 
      and lung metastases with an echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like
      4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) gene translocation. The patient was
      treated with crizotinib and showed a twelve-month progression-free survival.
      Clinicians should be attentive of the evolution of brain metastases with patients
      presenting EML4-ALK translocation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although it is advocated that (major) surgical procedures should be
      embedded in clinical pathways, the efficacy of such pathways is hardly ever
      systematically evaluated. The objective of our study was to assess the results of
      a multidisciplinary care path for patients undergoing thoracic cancer surgery,
      using a concurrent integrated prospective database. METHODS: From April 2006 to
      December 2008, 169 eligible patients, admitted for thoracic cancer surgery in our
      institute, gave informed consent to participate in this prospective study.
      Detailed clinical data concerning patient-, tumour-, treatment- and outcome
      characteristics were collected. For evaluation of pain and quality of life (QoL),
      visual analogue scale (VAS) and SF-36 were used respectively. Information
      retrieved on 94 patients operated in the baseline period (until November 2007)
      was used in multidisciplinary consensus meetings to develop a new care path.
      After the introduction of this care path (January 2008) data-collection continued
      to evaluate outcome using the data of 75 patients operated in the evaluation
      period (until December 2008). RESULTS: Data from the baseline period showed age
      (p=0.001), indication (p=0.03), postoperative pain (p<0.001) and complications
      (p<0.001) to be independently related to length of stay (LOS). Subsequently, the 
      package of measures taken in the multidisciplinary care path were evaluated,
      showing significantly less postoperative pain (p=0.026) and a reduced length of
      hospital stay (p=0.014). In addition, a (trend towards) improvement in physical
      quality of life was observed 1 month (p=0.03) and 6 months (p=0.07)
      postoperatively. CONCLUSION: The use of a prospective database integrated in a
      clinical care path for thoracic cancer patients revealed important improvements
      of the care process determining short- and long-term outcome. There was a
      significant reduction in length of hospital stay, postoperative pain and loss of 
      quality of life. Ongoing and multicentre collection of such data can provide
      surgeons with instruments to further improve quality of care.

AB  - Female lung cancer mortality increased by 50% between the mid 1960s and the early
      2000s in the European Union (EU). To monitor the current lung cancer epidemic in 
      European women, we analyzed mortality trends in 33 European countries between
      1970 and 2009 and estimated rates for the year 2015 using data from the World
      Health Organization. Female lung cancer mortality has been increasing up to
      recent calendar years in most European countries, with the exceptions of Belarus,
      Russia, and Ukraine, with relatively low rates, and the UK, Iceland and Ireland, 
      where high rates were reached in mid/late 1990s to leveled off thereafter. In the
      EU, female lung cancer mortality rates rose over the last decade from 11.3 to
      12.7/100,000 (+2.3% per year) at all ages and from 18.6 to 21.5/100,000 (+3.0%
      per year) in middle-age. A further increase is predicted, to reach 14/100,000
      women in 2015. Lung cancer mortality trends have been more favorable over the
      last decade in young women (20-44 years), particularly in the UK and other former
      high-risk countries from northern and central/eastern Europe, but also in France,
      Italy, and Spain where mortality in young women has been increasing up to the
      early 2000s. In the EU as a whole, mortality at age 20-44 years decreased from
      1.6 to 1.4/100,000 (-2.2% per year). Although the female lung cancer epidemic in 
      Europe is still expanding, the epidemic may be controlled through the
      implementation of effective anti-tobacco measures, and it will probably never
      reach the top US rates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug repurposing for cancer treatment is an emerging approach to
      discover clinically approved drugs that demonstrate antineoplastic effect. The
      effective therapeutics for patients with advanced adrenocortical carcinoma(ACC)
      are greatly needed. The objective of this study was to identify and validate
      drugs with antineoplastic effect in ACC cells using a novel quantitative
      high-throughput drug screening (qHTS) technique. METHODS: A quantitative
      high-throughput proliferation assay of 2,816 clinically approved drugs was
      performed in the NCI-H295R ACC cell line. We validated the antiproliferative
      effect of candidate compounds in NCI-H295R cells. Further validation was
      performed in 3-dimensional multicellular aggregates (MCA) of NCI-H295R and SW-13 
      cell lines. RESULTS: We identified 79 active compounds against ACC cells; 21 had 
      an efficacy >/= 60% and IC50 <1 muM. The top drug categories enriched were
      cardiotonic, antiseptic, and antineoplastic. We selected Bortezomib, ouabain,
      Methotrexate, pyrimethamine for validation. All had an antiproliferative effect
      in monolayer culture of NCI-H295R cells at clinical achievable serum level.
      Bortezomib and ouabain inhibited growth of MCA in both cell lines at a low
      concentration (10 fold below IC50). Methotrexate inhibited growth and caused
      disintegration of MCA in both cell lines at concentrations well below the maximum
      serum level (10 to 100 fold of IC50). Pyrimethamine caused growth inhibition in
      both cell lines at 10 fold of IC50 concentration. CONCLUSIONS: qHTS of previously
      approved compounds is an effective and efficient method to identify anticancer
      drugs for a rare cancer such as ACC. We have validated the antineoplastic effect 
      of Bortezomib, ouabain, Methotrexate and pyrimethamine, which could be translated
      into clinical trials in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic ACC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy of prostate cancers, over the last few years, has been
      an alternative choice to radical prostatectomy in the case of localised cancers
      as well as being the preferred treatment in both advanced localised cancers and
      those of the elderly. A conventional course of prostate radiotherapy consisting
      of four to five sessions a week, lasts between 7 and 8 weeks plus about one week 
      of preparation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of the scientific
      literature based on Pubmed, along with an exhaustive review of randomised studies
      presented at international congresses, have made it possible to analyse the
      numerous therapeutic regimens available other than the conventional
      normofractioned one (i.e. with doses per session ranging between 1.8 and 2.2
      grays). RESULTS: Five randomised trials reported since 2005, plus several
      thousand patients treated by stereotaxic radiotherapy, have given rise to
      numerous scientific questions; these alternative hypofractioned courses (dose per
      fraction higher than 2.2 grays) have a potentially enhanced antitumoral
      efficacity along with the practical advantages of a shortened duration of
      radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: The aim of this analysis of the scientific literature
      on hypofractioning in prostate cancer radiotherapy is to gather all the
      scientific evidence we currently have at our disposal. Further mature results of 
      future randomised trials will have to be examined before modifying current
      practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the impact of preoperative clinical data that could
      influence the undertaking of small renal masses (size<4cm) and to direct patients
      towards surgery or observance or radiofrequency. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From
      January 2000 to December 2010, 253 small renal masses were included in a
      retrospective study. Renal masses less than 3cm were compared to the 3 to 4cm
      masses. Clinical data, pathological data and follow-up was noted prospectively on
      the database and we analyzed it according to the treatment done (surgery,
      radiofrequency or observation). RESULTS: Surgical treatment, radiofrequency and
      observation were performed for 214 (86.4%), 15 (5.9%), and 24 (9.5%) patients
      respectively. The treatments of the patients differed in the two groups (<3cm vs.
      3-4cm) and the appeal to radiofrequency and observation was more frequent for
      elder patients (>65years old) and for those whom performance status (ECOG status)
      greater or equal to 1. Cancer specific survival was not statistically different
      for the two groups (average: 87.5% after 5years, mean 33months follow-up, P=0.7).
      Independent risk factors of recurrence were Fuhrman grade, synchronous tumors,
      noddles invasion and metastatic progression. Positive surgical margins were not a
      risk factor of recurrence (P=0.6). CONCLUSION: Age and performance status are the
      two main clinical data, which influence the treatment for patients with small
      renal masses. Radiofrequency and observation were undertaken more regularly for
      elder and altered ones. The use of scales as Charlson Index or Lee scale could
      help to choose more easily according to global morbidity and mortality.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the association of soft tissue surgical margins (STSM) and/or 
      lymph node metatstasis (pN+) with characteristics and outcomes of patients
      treated with radical cystectomy (RC) for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder
      (UCB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected the data of 242
      patients treated with RC and pelvic lymphadenectomy for UCB between January 2005 
      and June 2009. Different parameters were studied: age, PSAt, pathological stage
      of cystectomy specimen (pT and pN), tumor grade, number (nb) of nodes (N) in
      lymphadenectomy, nb of metastatic nodes (nb N+), bigger diameter of N+,
      ganglionic density, nb of N with capsular ruptur, associated CIS, associated
      prostate cancer, follow-up, global and specific survival, date and etiology of
      death. RESULTS: Positive STSM were identified in 22 patients (9.1%) and lymph
      node metastasis in 59 (24.4%). pN+ status was significantly associated with lower
      global (GS) and specific survival (SS) (P<0.003). So was it for patients with
      positive STSM R+ with actuarial 3-year GS and SS respectively of 5% and 25%
      versus 35% and 43.9% no STSM (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Positive soft tissue
      surgical margin and/or lymph node metatstasis on cystectomy specimen is a strong 
      predictor of GS and SS from urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. So it is for
      capsular rupture, ganglionic density greater or equal to 0.10 and nb of N in
      lymphadenectomy less than 14 for pN+ patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Prostatic diseases are very important in urologist's practice. We
      wanted to study evolution of prostatic procedures using French national coding
      database. METHODS: We searched the Agence Technique d'Information sur
      l'Hospitalisation (ATIH) web server for prostatic procedures between 1997 and
      2011 for both private and public sectors. RESULTS: The procedures were more often
      performed in private sector (up to 70%). There was a sustained increase (+332%)
      of the number of prostatectomies between 1997 and 2007 (more than 27,000
      procedures), followed by a slight decrease. There is a rising use of laparoscopic
      approach from 35% in 2006 up to 58% in 2011. The use of brachytherapy and HIFU
      was marginal. Transurethral resection of the prostate number was stable between
      56,000 and 60,000 procedures a year (for cancer for less than 7%). Adenomectomies
      number decreased from 9832 to 7963 procedures a year. CONCLUSION: The most
      noticeable data were upon prostatectomies number, with a peak effect in 2007.
      Laparoscopic procedures were more and more frequent. TURP number was stable,
      whereas adenomectomies number decreased.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: An elevated PSA and a negative prostate biopsy (PB) can be a false 
      negative PB that ignores a prostate cancer (PCa) or a false positive PSA not
      related to PCa. The objective of this study was to analyze a group of patients
      who had a negative first BP for a PSA superior to 4 ng/mL and at least one
      additional PB and to compare these cases with controls who had the diagnosis PCa 
      from the first PB. METHODS: Retrospective single-center study comparing patients 
      with an elevated PSA and repeat biopsy following a first negative PB and patients
      with PCa diagnosed from the first PB. RESULTS: The 63 cases were younger than the
      75 controls and had more often a normal digital rectal examination. Their
      prostate volume was larger and their number of PSA before the first PB lower:
      this corresponded to a lower PSA in the second (7/64), third (6/31), fourth (3/9)
      and sixth (1/1) PB. Among these cases with PCa, the length of core invaded by
      cancer and the total length of cancer of the entire PB were smaller than
      controls. In 76% of cases, the Gleason score among cases was 6 or less.
      CONCLUSION: PCa discovered on repeat biopsy had features of better prognosis than
      those of controls. We propose an algorithm for management of patients with
      elevated PSA and negative first PB.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Controversy about quality-of-life (QOL) benefits of sentinel lymph
      node biopsy (SLNB) versus axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with 
      breast cancer remains. Our aim was to compare the impact of SLNB and ALND on QOL 
      and arm symptoms of patients with early breast cancer, using generic (short form 
      36 health survey) and tumor site-specific (FACT-B+4) instruments. METHODS: This
      was a prospective longitudinal observational study of 93 patients (64 SLNB, 29
      ALND). Patients were evaluated presurgery and 1, 6, and 12 months postsurgery.
      Generalized estimation equation models were constructed to assess the effect of
      treatment on QOL. The relative risks of edema, dysesthesia, and heaviness were
      calculated comparing ALND to SLND. RESULTS: Most patients presented T1 (67.7%)
      and underwent breast-conserving surgery (92.5%). At 12 months, the SLNB group
      presented deterioration on the FACT-B+4 Arm Scale (beta coefficient estimated a
      change of -1.6 score points; P < 0.01) while, compared with SLNB, the
      deterioration in the ALND group was almost 2 additional score points higher (P = 
      0.009). FACT-B+4 global summary and short form 36 health survey did not show
      statistically significant differences between groups. Relative risk of
      dysesthesia and subjective edema was higher for the ALND group than for the SLNB 
      group (1.97 and 2.11 at month 12; P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: These results confirm
      the benefit of SLNB due to its lower arm morbidity impact on QOL, compared with
      ALND. There are clinically relevant between-treatment differences in the Arm
      Scale of FACT-B+4, while there were no relevant differences in general
      well-being, measured with the disease-specific FACT-B+4 and the generic short
      form 36 health survey.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the preferences of health care professional groups and
      patient groups with respect to efficacy, adverse events, and administration
      method for targeted agents of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. METHODS: A total
      of 485 respondents including cancer patients and health care professionals
      (medical oncologists, nurses, and pharmacists) were surveyed by using a discrete 
      choice experiment in South Korea. Through a literature review and expert
      consultation, six attributes--progression-free survival, four adverse events
      (bone marrow suppression, hand-foot skin reaction, gastrointestinal perforation, 
      and bleeding), and administration--were selected. This study employed the
      conditional logit regression model. RESULTS: The six attributes are statistically
      significant for the patient group and health care professional group. The two
      groups, however, present differences in progression-free survival, hand-foot skin
      reaction, gastrointestinal perforation, and administration. The relative
      importance of adverse events is greater for the patient group, while that of
      efficacy and administration is greater for the health professional group. For
      doctors, the relative importance of efficacy is as high as 31%, compared with 7% 
      for the patient group. If progression-free survival is prolonged by 1 month, the 
      acceptable level of bone marrow suppression is 1.3% for the patient group and
      9.6% for doctors and that of hand-foot skin reaction is 1.0% and 11.8%,
      respectively, for the patient group and doctors. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      demonstrates substantial differences in the preference for a targeted drug
      between the patient group and the health care professional group. Doctors prefer 
      effective and orally administered drugs while patients show more reluctant
      attitudes about adverse events than do health care professionals.

TI  - Daily administration of low molecular weight heparin increases Hepatocyte Growth 
      Factor serum levels in gynaecological patients: pharmacokinetic parameters and
      clinical implications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) enhances cytotoxicity of paclitaxel
      (PTX) and cisplatin (CDDP) in human ovarian cancer cells. Because of potential
      pitfalls of HGF exogenous administration, we investigated whether HGF serum
      concentration might be alternatively raised in vivo by administering low
      molecular weight heparin (LMWH). METHODS: The main HGF pharmacokinetic parameters
      were evaluated following acute and chronic LMWH treatment. First, women, operated
      on for gynaecological tumors, were treated with a single dose of calcium
      nadroparin and studied for 12 hours. Next, women operated on for benign or
      malignant gynaecological tumors were treated daily with calcic nadroparin for one
      month. Subsequently, the biological activity of the measured HGF serum levels was
      tested in assays of ovarian cancer cell sensitization to drugs. RESULTS: In the
      short-term treated group, median HGF AUCss, Cmax and Caverage were about
      four-fold that of the control group, whereas Cmin was three-fold. In the patients
      treated chronically median HGF serum levels rose about six-fold in the first
      week, and decreased but remained significantly higher after one month. The
      pharmacokinetic of nadroparin-dependent HGF increase were similar in the two
      groups. The HGF concentrations measured after both acute and chronic treatment
      were found to be effective in sensitising ovarian cancer cells to
      chemotherapeutics. CONCLUSIONS: This study raises the possibility of using LMWH
      to increase HGF serum concentration and to take advantage of its biological
      activities. In particular, nadroparin might be used as a chemo-potentiating agent
      in epithelial cell ovarian carcinoma through its action on HGF serum
      concentration. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01523652.

AB  - In a recent paper, Aceto and colleagues report that Src homology 2
      domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (Shp2) plays a critical role in 
      maintenance of breast tumour-initiating cells, and they define novel effectors
      downstream of Shp2 that regulate cellular invasion and self-renewal, including
      the transcription factors c-Myc and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 and the 
      suppressor of miRNA biogenesis lin-28 homolog B. These findings provide important
      mechanistic insights into breast tumourigenesis and highlight Shp2 as a potential
      therapeutic target.

TI  - Social networks of experientially similar others: formation, activation, and
      consequences of network ties on the health care experience.

AB  - Research documents that interactions among experientially similar others
      (individuals facing a common stressor) shape health care behavior and ultimately 
      health outcomes. However, we have little understanding of how ties among
      experientially similar others are formed, what resources and information flows
      through these networks, and how network embeddedness shapes health care behavior.
      This paper uses in-depth interviews with 76 parents of pediatric cancer patients 
      to examine network ties among experientially similar others after a serious
      medical diagnosis. Interviews were conducted between August 2009 and May 2011.
      Findings demonstrate that many parents formed ties with other families
      experiencing pediatric cancer, and that information and resources were exchanged 
      during the everyday activities associated with their child's care. Network flows 
      contained emotional support, caregiving strategies, information about second
      opinions, health-related knowledge, and strategies for navigating the health care
      system. Diffusion of information, resources, and support occurred through
      explicit processes (direct information and support exchanges) and implicit
      processes (parents learning through observing other families). Network flows
      among parents shaped parents' perceptions of the health care experience and their
      role in their child's care. These findings contribute to the social networks and 
      social support literatures by elucidating the mechanisms through which network
      ties among experientially similar others influence health care behavior and
      experiences.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand the relationship between human papillomavirus (HPV)
      genotype distribution and cervical neoplasia among women with abnormal cytology
      in Beijing. METHODS: In a study in Beijing, China, participants underwent a
      gynecologic examination between September 2006 and December 2009. Those with
      abnormal cytology underwent colposcopy, biopsy, and HPV testing. HPV was typed by
      flow-through hybridization on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. RESULTS:
      Among 6339 women examined, 533 with abnormal cytology underwent HPV testing. The 
      prevalence of high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) subtypes was 29.8%. HPV-16 was the most
      common genotype (12.8%), followed by HPV-33, HPV-58, HPV-66, HPV-18, and HPV-52. 
      The cytologic and histopathologic grade clearly increased with a higher
      prevalence of HR-HPV infection. Both HPV-16 and HPV-33 were significantly
      associated with grade CIN2+ lesions (P<0.05). By contrast, HPV-18 and HPV-66 were
      not associated with cervical lesion severity. HR-HPV infection was most common
      among women aged 30-34 years (35.0%). CONCLUSION: HPV-16, HPV-58, HPV-33, HPV-66,
      HPV-18, and HPV-52 were the most common genotypes in Beijing. HPV-16 and HPV-33
      might be associated with CIN2+ lesions. HPV-18 and HPV-66 were not associated
      with high-grade cervical lesions. The present results might help to improve HPV
      vaccination and cervical cancer prevention programs in Beijing.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the management of orbital exenterations and the surgical
      techniques for the reconstruction of orbital exenteration cavities. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: This retrospective study includes 56 patients who underwent orbital
      exenteration between 2000 and 2009. Patients' age at the time of exenteration,
      diagnoses, complications and reconstructive techniques were studied. RESULTS:
      Fifty-six patients - 31 male and 25 female patients - who underwent orbital
      exenteration between 2000 to 2009 were included in the study. The mean age was
      62.5 years at the time of exenteration. Average follow-up was 23 months. The
      principal diagnoses were basal cell carcinoma of the eyelids (25%) and
      conjunctival melanoma (20%). For orbital reconstruction, 18 patients (32%) had a 
      muscle flap, and 24 patients (43%) underwent secondary reconstruction by
      bone-anchored implants after spontaneous epithelialisation of the orbit.
      Approximately 50% of the patients received postoperative radiation therapy.
      DISCUSSION: Surgical reconstruction using muscle flaps may mask recurrent tumor. 
      Epithelialisation and bone-anchored implants supporting the prosthesis allow for 
      recurrent cancer surveillance while providing better stabilization of the
      prosthesis. Radiation therapy seems to render the orbit more fragile and thus
      less stable for implants. CONCLUSION: Orbital exenteration is a mutilating
      technique. Rehabilitation techniques have been improved, in particular the
      bone-anchored implants which allow adaptation of the prosthesis with satisfactory
      cosmetic results.

AB  - PURPOSE: Rectal toxicity is a serious adverse effect in early-stage prostate
      cancer patients treated with curative radiation therapy (RT). Injecting a spacer 
      between Denonvilliers' fascia increases the distance between the prostate and the
      anterior rectal wall and may thus decrease the rectal radiation-induced toxicity.
      We assessed the dosimetric impact of this spacer with advanced delivery RT
      techniques, including intensity modulated RT (IMRT), volumetric modulated arc
      therapy (VMAT), and intensity modulated proton beam RT (IMPT). METHODS AND
      MATERIALS: Eight prostate cancer patients were simulated for RT with or without
      spacer. Plans were computed for IMRT, VMAT, and IMPT using the Eclipse treatment 
      planning system using both computed tomography spacer+ and spacer- data sets.
      Prostate +/- seminal vesicle planning target volume [PTV] and organs at risk
      (OARs) dose-volume histograms were calculated. The results were analyzed using
      dose and volume metrics for comparative planning. RESULTS: Regardless of the
      radiation technique, spacer injection decreased significantly the rectal dose in 
      the 60- to 70-Gy range. Mean V(70 Gy) and V(60 Gy) with IMRT, VMAT, and IMPT
      planning were 5.3 +/- 3.3%/13.9 +/- 10.0%, 3.9 +/- 3.2%/9.7 +/- 5.7%, and 5.0 +/-
      3.5%/9.5 +/- 4.7% after spacer injection. Before spacer administration, the
      corresponding values were 9.8 +/- 5.4% (P=.012)/24.8 +/- 7.8% (P=.012), 10.1 +/- 
      3.0% (P=.002)/17.9 +/- 3.9% (P=.003), and 9.7 +/- 2.6% (P=.003)/14.7% +/- 2.7%
      (P=.003). Importantly, spacer injection usually improved the PTV coverage for
      IMRT. With this technique, mean V(70.2 Gy) (P=.07) and V(74.1 Gy) (P=0.03) were
      100 +/- 0% to 99.8 +/- 0.2% and 99.1 +/- 1.2% to 95.8 +/- 4.6% with and without
      Spacer, respectively. As a result of spacer injection, bladder doses were usually
      higher but not significantly so. Only IMPT managed to decrease the rectal dose
      after spacer injection for all dose levels, generally with no observed increase

      substantial decrease of rectal dose was observed after spacer injection for
      curative RT to the prostate.

AB  - During the past few decades, many studies on socio-economic factors and health
      outcomes have been developed using various methodologies with differing
      approaches. A bibliographic research in MEDLINE/PubMed and SCOPUS was carried out
      for the period 2000-2011 to describe the influence of socio-economic status (SES)
      on cancer survival, in particular with reference to the outcome of European
      research results and the results of some cases of other Western studies. This
      review is divided into two sections: the first describing the different
      approaches of the study on individuals and populations of the concept of "social 
      class" as well as methods used to measure the association between deprivation and
      health (i.e. ecological level studies, deprivation indexes, etc.); and the second
      discussing the association between socio-economic factors and cancer survival,
      describing the roles of various determinants of differences in survival, such as 
      clinical and pathological prognostic factors, together with consideration of
      diagnosis and treatment and some patients' characteristics.

      patients with malignancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is widely
      performed for nutrition or palliation, PEG-associated outcomes in cancer patients
      remain poorly described. We examined the safety and benefits of PEG placement in 
      this population at our institution. STUDY DESIGN: A 5-year retrospective review
      of patients with malignancy (excluding head/neck and thoracic malignancy) who
      underwent PEG at our institution was performed. RESULTS: One hundred and
      eighty-nine patients with malignancy underwent PEG; 33.9% had hematologic
      malignancy, 66.1% had nonhematologic malignancy, and 44.4% had metastatic
      disease. Indications for PEG were enteral access (73%) and gastric
      decompression/management of obstructive symptoms (27%). Few patients achieved
      independence from total parenteral nutrition (22%) or diet advancement (24.6%).
      Overall rates of major complications (eg, aspiration, tube dislodgement/leakage, 
      bleeding, visceral injury, respiratory failure after procedure, and cardiac
      arrest) and minor complications (eg, superficial infection and ileus) were 10.2% 
      and 11.3%, respectively. All-cause in-hospital mortality was high (19.6%) and was
      associated with ICU admission (p = 0.018), earlier bone marrow transplantation (p
      = 0.022), steroid treatment (p = 0.024), and lower preoperative albumin (p =
      0.003). Code status was changed after PEG in 44 patients from full code to DNR/do
      no intubate or comfort measures only. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous endoscopic
      gastrostomy placement in this study population was associated with major
      procedure-related complications. The majority of patients failed to achieve total
      parenteral nutrition independence or advancement of diet. Nearly 25% of patients 
      declined aggressive resuscitation strategies after undergoing surgery for PEG.
      This study cautions to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of PEG placement in
      this patient population. Prospective studies are needed to uncover factors
      affecting the decision process and patient selection.

AB  - CONTEXT: Controversies and uncertainties among integral management of advanced
      castration resistant prostate cancer continue to exist despite the number of
      evidence based clinical practice guidelines published with high international
      consensus. OBJECTIVE: To develop a document that reviews the management of
      controversies in advanced castration resistant prostate cancer, with
      recommendations from the definition, to the management in hormonal maneuvers,
      first-line treatment and second-line with new treatments as cabazitaxel or
      abirarerone and the multidisciplinary approach of the pathology with the goal of 
      finding the most efficient, best time to act and safety. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION:
      Two meetings of a multidisciplinary group of experts involved in the management
      of this disease (Oncologist and Urologist) where pooled analysis of original
      literature and reached consensus document of recommendations on castration
      resistant prostate cancer, reviewing and attempting to address the current
      controversies of the disease. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: This document is endorsed by
      the corresponding Scientific Associations and Working Groups involved in the
      current management of Genitourinary Tumours: the Spanish Association of Urology
      (AEU) with the Uro-Oncoloy Group (GUO) and the Spanish Oncology of Genitourinary 
      Group (SOGUG). CONCLUSIONS: With the adaptation and implementation of this
      Document of Recommendations for clinical practice are available for the first
      time, a real road map for quality, efficiency and safety in the management of
      patients with CRPC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic value of metabolic tumor burden as measured
      with metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) on
      2-deoxy-2-((18)F)fluoro-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography
      (PET)/computed tomography (CT), independent of current Union Internacional Contra
      la Cancrum/American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM)
      stage; in comparison with that of standardized uptake value (SUV) in surgical
      patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This
      study retrospectively reviewed 104 consecutive surgical patients (47 males, 57
      females, median age at PET/CT scan of 67.92 years) with diagnosed stage I to IV
      NSCLC who had baseline (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans. The (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans were
      performed in accordance with National Cancer Institute guidelines. The MTV of
      tumors in the whole body (MTV(WB)), TLG of tumors in the whole body (TLG(WB)),
      the maximum standardized uptake value of tumors in the whole body (SUV(maxWB)) as
      well as the mean standardized uptake value of tumor in the whole body
      (SUV(meanWB)) were measured. The median follow-up among 67 survivors was 42.07
      months from the PET/CT (range 2.82-80.95 months). Statistical methods included
      Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox regression, and C-statistics. The interobserver
      variability of SUV(maxWB), SUV(meanWB), MTV(WB), and TLG(WB) between two
      observers was analyzed using concordance correlation coefficients (CCCs).
      RESULTS: The interobserver variability of SUV(maxWB), SUV(meanWB), MTV(WB) and
      TLG(WB) was very low with CCCs greater than 0.882. There was a statistically
      significant association of stage with overall survival (OS). The hazard ratio
      (HR) of stage III and stage IV as compared with stage I was 3.60 (P = .001) and
      4.00 (P = .013), respectively. The MTV(WB) was significantly associated with OS
      with a HR for 1-unit increase of ln(MTV(WB)) of 1.40/1.32 (P = .004/.039),
      before/after adjusting for stage and other prognostic factors including
      chemoradiation therapy, and surgical procedure, respectively. TLG(WB) had a
      statistically significant association with OS before and after adjusting for
      stage and the other prognostic factors. The HR for 1-unit increase in ln(TLG(WB))
      was 1.26 (P = .011) and 1.25 (P = .031), before and after the adjustment,
      respectively. Subjects with conditions that led to pneumonectomy (HR = 2.82, P = 
      .035) or segmental resection (HR = 3.44, P = .044) had significantly worse
      survival than those needing lobectomy. There was no statistically significant
      association between OS and age, gender, tumor histology, ln(SUV(maxWB)), and
      ln(SUV(meanWB)) (all P > .05). There were 37 deaths during follow-up. CONCLUSION:
      Baseline whole-body metabolic tumor burden as measured with MTV(WB) and TLG(WB)
      on FDG PET is a prognostic measure independent of clinical stage and other
      prognostic factors including chemoradiation therapy and surgical procedure with
      low interobserver variability and may be used to further risk stratify surgical
      patients with NSCLC. This study also suggests that MTV and TLG are better
      prognostic measures than SUV(max) and SUV(mean). These results will need to be
      validated in larger cohorts in a prospective study.

TI  - An European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer phase I study of
      lapatinib and docetaxel as neoadjuvant treatment for human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive locally-advanced/inflammatory or large operable
      breast cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lapatinib is an effective anti-HER2 therapy in advanced breast cancer
      and docetaxel is one of the most active agents in breast cancer. Combining these 
      agents in pre-treated patients with metastatic disease had previously proved
      challenging, so the primary objective of this study aimed to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in treatment-naive patients, by identifying acute
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) during cycle 1 in the first part of a phases 1-2
      neoadjuvant European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)
      trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with large operable or locally-advanced
      HER2 positive breast cancer were treated with continuous lapatinib, and docetaxel
      every 21days for 4 cycles. Dose levels (DLs) were: 1000/75, 1250/75, 1000/85,
      1250/85, 1000/100 and 1250/100 (mg/day)/(mg/m(2)). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients
      were included. Two DLTs occurred at dose level 5 (1000/100); one grade 4
      neutropenia >/= 7days and one febrile neutropenia. A further 3 patients were
      therefore treated at the same dose with prophylactic granulocyte-colony
      stimulating factor (G-CSF), and 3 patients at dose level 6. No further DLTs were 
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our recommended dose for phase II is lapatinib 1000mg/day 
      and docetaxel 100mg/m(2) with G-CSF in HER2 positive non-metastatic breast
      cancer. The dose of lapatinib should have been 1250mg/day but we were mindful of 
      the high rate of treatment discontinuation in GeparQuinto with lapatinib
      1250mg/day combined with docetaxel. No grade 3-4 diarrhoea was observed.
      Pharmacodynamics analysis suggests that concomitant medications altering
      P-glycoprotein activity (in addition to lapatinib) can modify toxicity, including
      non-haematological toxicities. This needs verification in larger trials, where it
      may contribute to understanding the sources of variability in clinical toxicity
      and treatment discontinuation.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) - short non-coding RNA molecules - post-transcriptionally
      regulate gene expressions and play crucial roles in diverse biological processes 
      such as development, differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation. In order to
      investigate the possible role of miRNAs in the development of multi-drug
      resistance (MDR) in human glioblastoma, we first detected (by Western blotting,
      real-time polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] and immunohistochemistry) the
      expression of miR-296-3p and ether-a-go-go (EAG1 or KCNH1) in U251 cells,
      U251/imatinib mesylate (U251AR cells) and clinical specimens. The results showed 
      that miR-296-3p was down-regulated in U251AR cells, concurrent with the
      up-regulation of EAG1 protein, compared with the parental U251 cell line. In
      vitro drug sensitivity assay demonstrated that over-expression of miR-296-3p
      sensitised glioblastoma (GBM) cells to anticancer drugs, whereas down-expression 
      using antisense oligonucleotides conferred MDR. Ectopic expression of miR-296-3p 
      reduced EAG1 expression and suppressed cell proliferation drug resistance, and
      the luciferase activity of an EAG1 3'-untranslated region-based reporter
      construct in U251AR cells, whereas EAG1 over-expression rescued the suppressive
      effect of miR-296-3p in U251AR cells. We also found that EAG1 was widely
      over-expressed and inversely correlated with miR-296-3p in clinical specimens.
      Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-296-3p may play a role of MDR in
      glioblastoma at least in part by targeting EAG1.

TI  - A role of ghrelin in canine mammary carcinoma cells proliferation, apoptosis and 
      migration.
PG  - 170
LID - 10.1186/1746-6148-8-170 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ghrelin is a natural ligand of the growth hormone secretagogue
      receptor (GHS-R). They are often co-expressed in multiple human tumors and
      related cancer cell lines what can indicate that the ghrelin/GHS-R axis may have 
      an important role in tumor growth and progression. However, a role of ghrelin in 
      canine tumors remains unknown. Thus, the aim of our study was two-fold: (1) to
      assess expression of ghrelin and its receptor in canine mammary cancer and (2) to
      examine the effect of ghrelin on carcinoma cells proliferation, apoptosis,
      migration and invasion. The expression of ghrelin and its receptor in canine
      mammary cancer tissues and cell lines (isolated from primary tumors and their
      metastases) was examined using Real-time qPCR and immunohistochemistry. For
      apoptosis analysis the Annexin V and propidium iodide dual staining was applied
      whereas cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay and BrdU incorporation
      test. The influence of ghrelin on cancer cells migration and invasion was
      assessed using Boyden chamber assays and wound healing assay. RESULTS: The
      highest expression of ghrelin was observed in metastatic cancers whereas the
      lowest expression of ghrelin receptor was detected in tumors of the 3rd grade of 
      malignancy. Higher expression of ghrelin and its receptor was detected in cancer 
      cell lines isolated from metastases than in cell lines isolated from primary
      tumors. In vitro experiments demonstrated that exposure to low doses of ghrelin
      stimulates cellular proliferation, inhibits apoptosis and promotes motility and
      invasion of canine mammary cancer cells. Growth hormone secretagogue receptor
      inhibitor ([D-Lys3]-GHRP6) as well as RNA interference enhances early apoptosis. 
      CONCLUSION: The presence of ghrelin and GHS-R in all of the examined canine
      mammary tumors may indicate their biological role in cancer growth and
      development. Our experiments conducted in vitro confirmed that ghrelin promotes
      cancer development and metastasis.

AB  - AIM: Centromere protein H (CENP-H) is one of the essential components of the
      human active kinetochore which close links with carcinogenesis. Its expression
      and clinical value of prognostic prediction for gastric cancer (GC) is unclear.
      METHODS: CENP-H and Ki-67 expressions in specimens from 166 patients with GC were
      determined by tissue microarrays and immunostaining. Their correlations between
      patients' clinicopathologic features and prognosis were explored. For mechanisms,
      quantitative CENP-H examination on gastric cancer tissue and cell lines was
      performed via real-time quantitative PCR and Western Blot. Its effect on Survivin
      expression and cell function was evaluated via CENP-H knocking down (SiRNA) or
      overexpression. RESULTS: Highly expression of CENP-H was found in 85 of 166 GC,
      showing a significant correlation with tumour size, depth of infiltration, lymph 
      node metastasis, distant metastasis and UICC staging of gastric carcinoma (P <
      0.05), as well as clinical prognosis (coefficient = 0.550, P < 0.001).
      Multivariate analysis revealed that combined CENP-H and Ki67 expression was a
      more valuable independent prognostic predictor for patients' survival (hazard
      ratio, 2.18; P = 0.0109). Furthermore, total mRNA and protein expression of
      CENP-H in GC tissue and cell lines were noticeably increased. Survivin expression
      and cell function including growth, proliferation and clonogenic ability could be
      inhibited by CENP-H siRNA or enhanced by overexpressing CENP-H. CONCLUSION: High 
      expression of CENP-H in GC indicates poor prognosis and Survivin may mediate its 
      procancer role. Combined evaluation of CENP-H and Ki-67 aids in predicting the
      clinical prognosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To better understand the associations between the certificate of need 
      regulations and intensity-modulated radiotherapy dissemination. METHODS: Using
      Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data, we identified men
      (aged >/= 66 years) treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer who had been
      diagnosed from 2001 to 2007. Using data from the American Health Planning
      Association, we sorted the health service areas (HSAs) according to the
      stringency of certificate of need regulations (low vs high) in that market. We
      assessed our outcomes (ie, the probability of intensity-modulated radiotherapy
      adoption and intensity-modulated radiotherapy use in the HSAs) using Cox
      proportional hazards and Poisson regression models, respectively. RESULTS: The
      low- and high-stringency markets were similar in terms of racial composition (80%
      vs 85% white, P = .08), population density (1085 vs 558 people/square mile, P =
      .08), and income (median $38 683 vs $40 309, P = .44). However, the
      low-stringency markets had more patients with stage T1 disease (45% vs 36%, P <
      .01). The probability of intensity-modulated radiotherapy adoption across the 2
      groups of HSAs was similar (P = .65). However, among the adopting HSAs, those
      with high stringency consistently had greater use of intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy (P < .01). CONCLUSION: The certificate of need regulations fail to
      create significant barriers to entry for intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Among 
      the HSAs that acquired intensity-modulated radiotherapy, high-stringency markets 
      demonstrated a greater propensity for using intensity-modulated radiotherapy.
      These findings raise questions regarding the ability of the certificate of need
      regulations to control technology dissemination.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report long-term outcomes of selective organ preservation for
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) using 2 bladder-sparing trimodality
      approaches. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1990 to 2010, 80 patients with T2-T4
      bladder cancer were prospectively enrolled in 2 successive bladder-sparing
      protocols. Forty-one patients were treated with neoadjuvant methotrexate,
      cisplatin, and vinblastine (MCV) chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (60 Gy) in
      complete responders (protocol 1 [P1]) and 39 patients were treated with weekly
      cisplatin concurrent with radiotherapy (64.8 Gy) (protocol 2 [P2]). RESULTS: The 
      median follow-up was 72 months (range, 9-204 months). Five and 10-year cumulative
      overall survival for all series were 73% and 60% and the corresponding numbers
      for cancer-specific survival were 82% and 80%, respectively. Of all surviving
      patients, 83% maintained their own bladder. Although there were no significant
      differences in overall survival (P = .820), cancer-specific survival (P = .688)
      and distant metastasis (P = .417) between protocols, complete response rates (P =
      .003), and disease-free survival (P = .031) were significantly higher in P2
      treatment. CONCLUSION: Trimodality therapy with bladder preservation represents a
      real alternative to radical cystectomy (RC) in selected patients. Overall
      survival and cancer-specific survival rates are encouraging with more than 80% of
      survivors retaining functional bladders.

AB  - The goal of this study was CGH array profiling of breast cancer from Malian women
      in order to define differences with those from USA. CGH array was performed in 28
      samples, 17 with a triple negative phenotype. The profiles were compared to those
      of 106 tumors from USA. 6 chromosomal regions (6p21, 9q34, 11q13, 12q24, 17q25
      and 22q12.1-22q13.1) were identified with a significant higher rate of copy
      number alterations. These regions contain several genes of interest including
      BCR. FISH and IHC confirmed that BCR was amplified and overexpressed particularly
      in triple negative tumors. Finally, 5 regions presented a high level of
      amplification in two or more samples, including 2 regions located between
      9p22.3-9p23 and 9p23-9p24.1. This study confirms that breast cancers from African
      women present biological differences with those from USA. Larger studies are
      needed to go further in the identification of therapeutic targets that would be
      specific to African women.

AB  - Cancer cells cultured in physiologically relevant, three-dimensional (3D)
      matrices can recapture many essential features of native tumor tissues. In this
      study, a hyaluronic acid (HA)-based bilayer hydrogel system that not only
      supports the tumoroid formation from LNCaP prostate cancer (PCa) cells, but also 
      simulates their reciprocal interactions with the tumor-associated stroma was
      developed and characterized. HA hydrogels were prepared by mixing solutions of HA
      precursors functionalized with acrylate groups (HA-AC) and reactive thiols
      (HA-SH) under physiological conditions. The resultant viscoelastic gels have an
      average elastic modulus of 234 +/- 30 Pa and can be degraded readily by
      hyaluronidase. The orthogonal and cytocompatible nature of the crosslinking
      chemistry permits facile incorporation of cytokine-releasing particles and PCa
      cells. In our bilayer hydrogel construct, the top layer contains heparin
      (HP)-decorated, HA-based hydrogel particles (HGPs) capable of releasing
      heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) in a
      sustained manner at a rate of 2.5 wt%/day cumulatively. LNCaP cells embedded in
      the bottom layer receive the growth factor signals from the top, and in response 
      form enlarging tumoroids with an average diameter of 85 mum by day 7. Cells in 3D
      hydrogels assemble into spherical tumoroids, form close cellular contacts through
      E-cadherin, and show cortical organization of F-actin, whereas those plated as 2D
      monolayers adopt a spread-out morphology. Compared to cells cultured on 2D, the
      engineered tumoroids significantly increased the expression of two pro-angiogenic
      factors, vascular endothelial growth factor-165 (VEGF(165)) and interleukin-8
      (IL-8), both at mRNA and protein levels. Overall, the HA model system provides a 
      useful platform for the study of tumor cell responses to growth factors and for
      screening of anticancer drugs targeting these pathways.

AB  - PURPOSE: Histotripsy is a nonthermal ablative focused ultrasound technology with 
      possible future applications for prostate cancer focal therapy. We used the ACE-1
      prostate tumor model and evaluated the feasibility of treating prostate tumors
      with histotripsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 10 immunosuppressed
      (cyclosporine treated) canine subjects received transrectal ultrasound guided
      percutaneous intraprostatic injection of ACE-1 canine prostate cancer cells.
      Prostates were serially imaged with transrectal ultrasound to monitor tumor
      growth. Subjects were sham treated (3) or underwent transabdominal histotripsy of
      the prostate, which targeted implanted tumor and adjacent parenchyma using a 750 
      kHz piezoelectric ultrasound therapy transducer. Prostates were examined
      histologically to confirm tumor and the histotripsy treatment effect. RESULTS:
      ACE-1 tumors were visualized on transrectal ultrasound in all 10 subjects within 
      2 weeks of tumor injection. Lesions demonstrated growth in the prostatic capsule,
      glandular lobules, fibrous septa and periurethral stroma with significant
      desmoplastic reaction and areas of central necrosis on histology. Lymph node
      and/or pulmonary metastases developed in 4 subjects. Ultrasound tumor
      localization and initiation of cavitation during histotripsy therapy were
      feasible in all treated subjects. Histologically there was evidence of
      homogenization of tumor and prostatic parenchyma in all 4 acute subjects with
      necrosis and hemorrhage in the 3 chronic subjects. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows 
      the feasibility of histotripsy destruction of prostate tumors in a canine ACE-1
      model. It suggests a potential role for histotripsy based focal therapy for
      prostate cancer. Further studies are needed to better characterize the effects of
      histotripsy on malignant tissues.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary functional imaging using four-dimensional
      x-ray computed tomographic (4DCT) imaging and hyperpolarized (3)He magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) provides regional lung function estimates in patients
      with lung cancer in whom pulmonary function measurements are typically dominated 
      by tumor burden. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quantitative spatial
      relationship between 4DCT and hyperpolarized (3)He MRI ventilation maps.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients with lung cancer provided written informed
      consent to 4DCT imaging and MRI performed within 11 +/- 14 days. Hyperpolarized
      (3)He MRI was acquired in breath-hold after inhalation from functional residual
      capacity of 1 L hyperpolarized (3)He, whereas 4DCT imaging was acquired over a
      single tidal breath of room air. For hyperpolarized (3)He MRI, the percentage
      ventilated volume was generated using semiautomated segmentation; for 4DCT
      imaging, pulmonary function maps were generated using the correspondence between 
      identical tissue elements at inspiratory and expiratory phases to generate
      percentage ventilated volume. RESULTS: After accounting for differences in image 
      acquisition lung volumes ((3)He MRI: 1.9 +/- 0.5 L ipsilateral, 2.3 +/- 0.7 L
      contralateral; 4DCT imaging: 1.2 +/- 0.3 L ipsilateral, 1.3 +/- 0.4 L
      contralateral), there was no significant difference in percentage ventilated
      volume between hyperpolarized (3)He MRI (72 +/- 11% ipsilateral, 79 +/- 12%
      contralateral) and 4DCT imaging (74 +/- 3% ipsilateral, 75 +/- 4% contralateral).
      Spatial correspondence between 4DCT and (3)He MRI ventilation was evaluated using
      the Dice similarity coefficient index (ipsilateral, 86 +/- 12%; contralateral, 88
      +/- 12%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite rather large differences in image acquisition
      breathing maneuvers, good spatial and significant quantitative agreement was
      observed for ventilation maps on hyperpolarized (3)He MRI and 4DCT imaging,
      suggesting that pulmonary regions with good lung function are similar between
      modalities in this small group of patients with lung cancer.

AB  - Due to the critical role of forkhead box (Fox)p3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) in
      the regulation of immunity and the enrichment of Tregs within many human tumors, 
      several emerging therapeutic strategies for cancer involve the depletion or
      modulation of Tregs, with the aim of eliciting enhanced antitumor immune
      responses. Here, we review recent advances in understanding of the fundamental
      biology of Tregs, and discuss the implications of these findings for current
      models of tumor-associated Treg biology. In particular, we discuss the
      context-dependent functional diversity of Tregs, the developmental origins of

AB  - A 65-year-old woman with liver metastases from colon cancer and tumor thrombus
      extending from the right hepatic vein (HV) to the right atrium (RA) presented
      with marked lower-extremity edema and massive ascites. Computed tomography showed
      tumor thrombus completely occluding the inferior vena cava (IVC) and HV ostia.
      Recanalization of the IVC and HVs was performed. Metallic stents were placed in
      tandem from the superior vena cava to the IVC through the RA, and additional
      metallic stents were placed in the left HV. The patient's symptoms were relieved,
      and there was no recurrence of these symptoms for 19.5 months until death.

AB  - Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-related infections have
      recently been spreading and are difficult to control, partly because affected
      patients are frequently in a poor condition. This study retrospectively
      investigated recent MRSA-related infections focusing on the relationship between 
      clinical risk factors and anti-MRSA drug resistance. The patients with
      MRSA-related infections in Kobe University Hospital (Kobe, Japan) in 2009 were
      enrolled in the study. The relationships between various clinical risk factors as
      well as MRSA bacterial DNA concentration with minimum inhibitory concentrations
      (MICs) of anti-MRSA drugs were examined. In total, 44 patients were enrolled in
      the study and MRSA was isolated from blood (23 patients), urine (12 patients) and
      nasal secretions (9 patients). There was only one resistant strain to linezolid
      (LZD) among the anti-MRSA drugs tested, and this strain was considered
      staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type IIa from phage open-reading 
      frame typing analyses. Statistical analyses showed that MRSA bacterial DNA
      concentration, cancer and use of a respirator, respectively, had a significant
      relationship with the MICs of LZD (P=0.0058) and arbekacin (ABK) (P=0.0003), of
      quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) (P=0.0500) and ABK (P=0.0133), and of Q/D
      (P=0.0198) and vancomycin (P=0.0036). In conclusion, bacterial DNA concentration,
      cancer and use of a respirator were found to be significant risk factors for
      lower susceptibilities to anti-MRSA drugs; one strain was resistant to LZD. We
      suggest that further investigation and surveillance for MRSA-related infection
      are necessary for preventing the spread of MRSA-related infections.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to review and compare factors that influence
      cervical cancer screening behavior in HIV-infected women and uninfected women.
      The research literature revealed that age, ethnicity/race, tobacco use, weight,
      education, economic issues, and risky behaviors such as substance abuse were
      factors that influenced cervical cancer screening among all women. HIV viral load
      and CD4+ T lymphocyte count were serologic factors that affected cervical cancer 
      screening in HIV-infected women. Clinicians can use this information to identify 
      patients at risk for poor Pap test adherence. Future interventions to reduce
      potential barriers for cervical cancer screening are needed in HIV-infected
      women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the amount of shared decision making in breast cancer
      surgery interactions when providers do and do not make a treatment
      recommendation. METHODS: We surveyed breast cancer survivors who were eligible
      for mastectomy and lumpectomy. Patients reported whether the provider made a
      recommendation and the recommendation given. They completed items about their
      interaction including discussion of options, pros, cons, and treatment
      preference. A total involvement score was calculated with higher scores
      indicating more shared decision making. RESULTS: Most patients (85%) reported
      that their provider made a recommendation. Patients who did not receive a
      recommendation had higher involvement scores compared to those who did (52% vs.
      39.1%, p=0.004). Type of recommendation was associated with involvement. Patients
      given different recommendations had the highest total involvement scores followed
      by those who received mastectomy and lumpectomy recommendations (65.5% vs. 42.5% 
      vs. 33.2%, respectively, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Providers were less likely to
      present a balanced view of the options when they gave a recommendation for
      surgery. Patients who received a recommendation for lumpectomy had the lowest
      involvement score. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Providers need to discuss both
      mastectomy and lumpectomy and elicit patients' goals and treatment preferences
      regardless of whether or not a recommendation is given.

TI  - Dysmenorrhea and its severity are associated with increased uterine contractility
      and overexpression of oxytocin receptor (OTR) in women with symptomatic
      adenomyosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate uterine contractility, oxytocin receptor (OTR) expression 
      in myometrial smooth muscle cells (MSMCs) derived from uterine tissues from women
      with and without adenomyosis correlate OTR expression with uterine contractility 
      and dysmenorrhea severity, and see whether trichostatin A (TSA) and
      andrographolide inhibit OTR expression. DESIGN: Laboratory study using human
      tissues. SETTING: Academic hospital. PATIENT(S): Twenty patients (cases) with
      histologically confirmed adenomyosis and 10 (controls) with leiomyomas, cervical 
      dysplasia, and cancer but no adenomyosis or endometriosis. INTERVENTION(S):
      Dysmenorrhea severity was scored by Visual Analog Scale. Uterine tissue samples
      were collected during hysterectomy. Myometrial smooth muscle cells derived from
      tissue samples were cultured and OTR protein levels were measured. The effect of 
      TSA (0.5 or 1 muM) and andrographolide (15 or 30 muM) on OTR expression was
      evaluated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Visual Analog Scale scores, and contractile
      amplitude and frequency. The OTR protein levels in MSMCs were quantified by
      Western blot analysis. RESULT(S): The contractile amplitude and OTR expression
      levels were significantly higher in cases than in controls. Dysmenorrhea Visual
      Analog Scale scores correlated positively with contractile amplitude and OTR
      expression level. Both TSA and andrographolide dose-dependently inhibit OTR
      expression in MSMC. CONCLUSION(S): Oxytocin receptor overexpression in MSMCs may 
      be responsible for increased uterine contractility and adenomyosis-associated
      dysmenorrhea. Both histone deacetylase inhibitors and andrographolide are
      therapeutically promising.

AB  - microRNAs (miRNAs) play important role in regulating cancer stem cell
      self-renewal and differentiation, but the expression prolife of miRNAs in glioma 
      stem cells (GSCs) has not been addressed. Here, we found that CD133 positive GSCs
      possess a unique miRNAs profile compared to CD133 negative glioblastoma cells.
      miR-125b, as one of neuronal miRNAs, is the most significantly down-regulated
      miRNAs and overexpression of miR-125b inhibits the proliferation of CD133
      positive GSCs and reduces the expression of "stem" marker. Furthermore, two
      binding sites for miR-125b are identified in the 3'UTR of E2F2 and overexpression
      of miR-125b in CD133 positive GSCs represses the endogenous level of E2F2
      protein. This study demonstrated that miR-125b plays important roles in
      regulating the proliferation of GSCs by directly targeting E2F2.

AB  - Macrophages are the prominent components of solid tumors and have complex dual
      functions in their interaction with cancer cells. Strong evidence suggests that
      TAM is a part of inflammatory circuits that promote tumor progression.
      B7-homologue 3 (B7-H3), a recently identified homologue of B7.1/2 (CD80/86), has 
      been described to exert co-stimulatory and immune regulatory functions. Here, we 
      showed that a fraction of macrophages in tumor stroma expressed surface B7-H3
      molecule. Normal macrophages, which did not express B7-H3, would be induced
      expressing B7-H3 molecule when culturing with tumor cell. Although a lung cancer 
      cell line constitutively expressed B7-H3 mRNA and protein in plasma, primary
      tumor cell isolated from the transplanted lung carcinoma model expressed B7-H3 on
      the surface. Interestingly, in transplanted lung carcinoma model, the expression 
      of membrane-bound B7-H3 in tumor cells was increased as prolonging of tumor
      transformation. In support, IL-10 released from TAM could stimulate cancer cell
      expression of membrane bound B7-H3. Furthermore, Lung cancer and TAM-related
      B7-H3 was identified as a strong inhibitor of T-cell effect and influenced the
      outcome of T cell immune response. In conclusion, TAM-tumor cell
      interaction-induced membrane-bound B7-H3 represents a novel immune escape
      mechanism which links the pro-inflammatory response to immune tolerance in the
      tumor milieu.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant tumor of the 
      liver, accounting for 80%-90% of all liver cancers. The disease ranks as the
      fifth most common cancer worldwide and is the third leading cause of all
      cancer-associated deaths. Although advances in HCC detection and treatment have
      increased the likelihood of a cure at early stages of the disease, HCC remains
      largely incurable because of late presentation and tumor recurrence. Only 25% of 
      HCC patients are deemed suitable for curative treatment, with the overall
      survival at just a few months for inoperable patients. Apart from surgical
      resection, loco-regional ablation and liver transplantation, current treatment
      protocols include conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. But due to the highly
      resistant nature of the disease, the efficacy of the latter regimen is limited.
      The recent emergence of the cancer stem cell (CSC) concept lends insight into the
      explanation of why treatment with chemotherapy often may seem to be initially
      successful but results in not only a failure to eradicate the tumor but also
      possibly tumor relapse. Commonly used anti-cancer drugs in HCC work by targeting 
      the rapidly proliferating and differentiated liver cancer cells that constitute
      the bulk of the tumor. However, a subset of CSCs exists within the tumor, which
      are more resistant and are able to survive and maintain residence after
      treatment, thus, growing and self-renewing to generate the development and spread
      of recurrent tumors in HCC. In the past few years, compelling evidence has
      emerged in support of the hierarchic CSC model for solid tumors, including HCC.
      And in particular, CD133 has drawn significant attention as a critical liver CSC 
      marker. Understanding the characteristics and function of CD133(+) liver CSCs has
      also shed light on HCC management and treatment, including the implications for
      prognosis, prediction and treatment resistance. In this review, a detailed
      summary of the recent progress in CD133(+) liver CSC research with regard to
      identification, regulation and clinical implications will be discussed.

TI  - The impact of under and over-recording of cancer on death certificates in a
      competing risks analysis: a simulation study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With linked register and cause of death data becoming more accessible
      than ever, competing risks methodology is being increasingly used as a way of
      obtaining "real world" probabilities of death broken down by specific causes. It 
      is important, in terms of the validity of these studies, to have accurate cause
      of death information. However, it is well documented that cause of death
      information taken from death certificates is often lacking in accuracy and
      completeness. METHODS: We assess through use of a simulation study the effect of 
      under and over-recording of cancer on death certificates in a competing risks
      analysis consisting of three competing causes of death: cancer, heart disease and
      other causes. Using realistic levels of misclassification, we consider 24
      scenarios and examine the bias in the cause-specific hazard ratios and the
      cumulative incidence function. RESULTS: The bias in the cumulative incidence
      function was highest in the oldest age group reaching values as high as 2.6
      percentage units for the "good" cancer prognosis scenario and 9.7 percentage
      units for the "poor" prognosis scenario. CONCLUSION: The bias resulting from the 
      chosen levels of misclassification in this study accentuate concerns that
      unreliable cause of death information may be providing misleading results. The
      results of this simulation study convey an important message to applied
      epidemiological researchers.

TI  - The natural anticancer compounds rocaglamides inhibit the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway by 
      targeting prohibitin 1 and 2.

AB  - Rocaglamides are potent natural anticancer products that inhibit proliferation of
      various cancer cells at nanomolar concentrations. We have recently shown that
      these compounds prevent tumor growth and sensitize resistant cancer cells to
      apoptosis by blocking the MEK-ERK-eIF4 pathway. However, their direct molecular
      target(s) remain(s) unknown. In this study, using an affinity chromatography
      approach we discovered that prohibitin (PHB) 1 and 2 are the direct targets of
      rocaglamides. Binding of rocaglamides to PHB prevents interaction between PHB and
      CRaf and, thereby, inhibits CRaf activation and subsequently CRaf-MEK-ERK
      signaling. Moreover, knockdown of PHB mimicked the effects of rocaglamides on the
      CRaf-MEK-ERK pathway and cell cycle progression. Thus, our finding suggests that 
      rocaglamides are a new type of anticancer agent and that they may serve as a
      small-molecular tool for studying PHB-mediated cellular processes.

AB  - Proliferating tumor cells use aerobic glycolysis to support their high metabolic 
      demands. Paradoxically, increased glycolysis is often accompanied by expression
      of the lower activity PKM2 isoform, effectively constraining lower glycolysis.
      Here, we report the discovery of PKM2 activators with a unique allosteric binding
      mode. Characterization of how these compounds impact cancer cells revealed an
      unanticipated link between glucose and amino acid metabolism. PKM2 activation
      resulted in a metabolic rewiring of cancer cells manifested by a profound
      dependency on the nonessential amino acid serine for continued cell
      proliferation. Induction of serine auxotrophy by PKM2 activation was accompanied 
      by reduced carbon flow into the serine biosynthetic pathway and increased
      expression of high affinity serine transporters. These data support the
      hypothesis that PKM2 expression confers metabolic flexibility to cancer cells
      that allows adaptation to nutrient stress.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This population-based study on early breast cancer detection in
      women aimed to evaluate acoustic radiation force impulse elastography to
      differentiate BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) category 4
      lesions. METHODS: Acoustic radiation force impulse was performed on 95 patients
      with 122 BI-RADS 4 breast lesions diagnosed by conventional ultrasound. We
      calculated the area ratio of lesions by using virtual touch tissue imaging and
      gray-scale imaging. By using virtual touch tissue quantification, we calculated
      the ratio of shear wave velocity (SWV) in lesions and in surrounding glandular
      tissue at the same depth (SWV ratio). RESULTS: The mean area ratio of benign
      lesions (1.09 +/- 0.17) differed from that of the malignant lesions (1.96 +/-
      0.64; P < .001). The mean SWV ratio of benign lesions (2.44 +/- 1.27) was lower
      than that of malignant lesions (5.74 +/- 1.68; P < .001). The cutoff for the area
      and SWV ratios for malignancy were estimated to be 1.37 and 3.65, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: Acoustic radiation force impulse provides quantitative elasticity
      measurements, which, combined with conventional ultrasound, can potentially
      improve the diagnostic accuracy of BI-RADS 4 breast lesions, and it is helpful to
      regulate the BI-RADS classification and avoid the need for unnecessary biopsies.

AB  - Kisspeptins are G protein-coupled receptor ligands originally identified as human
      metastasis suppressor gene products that have the ability to suppress melanoma
      and breast cancer metastasis and which have recently been found to play an
      important role in initiating the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone at
      puberty. In the brain, the gene is transcribed within the hippocampal dentate
      gyrus. Kisspeptin-13, one of the endogenous isoforms, consists of 13 amino acids.
      In this work, antidepressant-like effects of kisspeptin-13 were studied and the
      potential involvement of the adrenergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic 
      and gabaergic receptors in its antidepressant-like effects was investigated in a 
      modified forced swimming test (FST) in mice. The mice were pretreated with a
      nonselective alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist, phenoxybenzamine, an
      alpha(1)/alpha(2beta)-adrenergic receptor antagonist, prazosin, an
      alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor antagonist, yohimbine, a beta-adrenergic receptor
      antagonist, propranolol, a mixed 5-HT(1)/5-HT(2) serotonergic receptor
      antagonist, methysergide, a nonselective 5-HT(2) serotonergic receptor
      antagonist, cyproheptadine, a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor
      antagonist, atropine, a D(2),D(3),D(4) dopamine receptor antagonist, haloperidol,
      or a gamma-aminobutyric acid subunit A receptor antagonist, bicuculline. The FST 
      revealed that kisspeptin-13 reversed the immobility, climbing and swimming times,
      suggesting antidepressant-like effects. Phenoxybenzamine, yohimbine and
      cyproheptadine prevented the effects of kisspeptin-13 on the immobility, climbing
      and swimming times, whereas prazosin, propranolol, methysergide, atropine,
      haloperidol and bicuculline did not modify the effects of kisspeptin-13. The
      results demonstrated that the antidepressant-like effects of kisspeptin-13 in a
      modified mouse FST are mediated, at least in part, by an interaction of the
      alpha(2)-adrenergic and 5-HT(2) serotonergic receptors.

AB  - Inflammation and apoptosis play an important role in cerebral ischemic
      pathogenesis and may represent a target for treatment. Silibinin has been proved 
      to elicit a variety of biological effects through its anti-inflammatory and
      anti-apoptotic properties in hepatotoxic, cancer and carcinogenic events. Whether
      this protective effect applies to ischemic injury in brain is still unknown, we
      therefore investigated the potential protective role of silibinin in ischemic
      stroke and the underlying mechanisms. Silibinin was administered intragastric 30 
      min before permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). We found that
      silibinin significantly alleviated neurological deficit, reduced infarct volume, 
      and suppressed brain edema, which were accompanied with upregulation of pAkt,
      pmTOR, HIF-1alpha, Bcl-2 and downregulation of Bax, NF-kappaB in ischemic brain
      tissue after stroke. Our results show that silibinin might exert
      anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects in ischemic brain through activating
      Akt/mTOR signaling.

AB  - Tumor suppressor gene silencing through cytosine methylation contributes to
      cancer formation. Whether DNA demethylation enzymes counteract this oncogenic
      effect is unknown. Here, we show that TET1, a dioxygenase involved in cytosine
      demethylation, is downregulated in prostate and breast cancer tissues. TET1
      depletion facilitates cell invasion, tumor growth, and cancer metastasis in
      prostate xenograft models and correlates with poor survival rates in breast
      cancer patients. Consistently, enforced expression of TET1 reduces cell invasion 
      and breast xenograft tumor formation. Mechanistically, TET1 suppresses cell
      invasion through its dioxygenase and DNA binding activities. Furthermore, TET1
      maintains the expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP) family 
      proteins 2 and 3 by inhibiting their DNA methylation. Concurrent low expression
      of TET1 and TIMP2 or TIMP3 correlates with advanced node status in clinical
      samples. Together, these results illustrate a mechanism by which TET1 suppresses 
      tumor development and invasion partly through downregulation of critical gene
      methylation.

AB  - Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with
      colorectal cancer (CRC) susceptibility. Most CRCs arise from adenomas, and SNPs
      therefore might affect predisposition to CRC by increasing adenoma risk. We found
      that 8 of 18 known CRC-associated SNPs (rs10936599, rs6983267, rs10795668,
      rs3802842, rs4444235, rs1957636, rs4939827, and rs961253) were over-represented
      in CRC-free patients with adenomas, compared with controls. Ten other
      CRC-associated SNPs (rs6691170, rs6687758, rs16892766, rs7136702, rs11169552,
      rs4779584, rs9929218, rs10411210, rs4813802, and rs4925386) were not associated
      significantly with adenoma risk. Genetic susceptibility to CRC in the general
      population is likely to be mediated in part by predisposition to adenomas.

AB  - PURPOSE: Holmium-166 acetylacetonate microspheres ((166)Ho-AcAc-MS) are proposed 
      as an intratumoral radioablation device. This article presents a pilot study in
      housecats with unresectable liver cancer. Feasibility and tolerability of
      intratumoral administrations of (166)Ho-AcAc-MS was investigated. METHODS AND
      MATERIALS: Three cats with unresectable liver tumors of different histotype were 
      included. One cat had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one had cholangiocarcinoma 
      (CC), and one had a malignant epithelial liver tumor (MELT) of unspecified
      histotype. (166)Ho-AcAc-MS were injected percutaneously under ultrasound guidance
      into the tumors. Followup consisted of physical examinations and hematologic and 
      biochemical analyses. RESULTS: (166)Ho-AcAc-MS were administered to three liver
      tumor-bearing cats. The treatment was well tolerated and the clinical condition, 
      that is body weight, alertness, mobility, and coat condition of the animals
      improved markedly. Most biochemical and hematologic parameters normalized shortly
      after treatment. Life of all cats was extended and associated with a good quality
      of life. The HCC cat that received 33-Gy tumor-absorbed dose was euthanized 6
      months after the first administration owing to disease progression. The MELT cat 
      received 99-Gy tumor dose and was euthanized 3 months posttreatment owing to
      bacterial meningitis. The CC cat received 333Gy and succumbed 4 months after the 
      first treatment owing to the formation of a pulmonary embolism. CONCLUSIONS:
      Percutaneous intratumoral injection of radioactive (166)Ho-AcAc-MS is feasible in
      liver tumor-bearing cats. The findings of this pilot study indicate that
      (166)Ho-AcAc-MS may constitute safe brachytherapeutic microspheres and warrant
      studies to confirm the clinical utility of this novel brachytherapy device.

AB  - PURPOSE: Earlier studies indicate that epigenetics contribute to the pathogenesis
      of penile squamous cell carcinoma. Histone methylation patterns are frequently
      altered during carcinogenesis. Therefore, we investigated the methylation pattern
      of the histones H3K4, H3K9 and H3K27 in penile carcinoma and normal tissue.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A tissue microarray was constructed with 65 penile
      carcinomas, 6 metastatic lesions and 30 control tissues. Global histone
      methylation was assessed using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Global levels of
      H3K4me1, H3K9me1, H3K9me2, H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 were decreased, whereas H3K9me3 
      was increased in penile carcinoma. Histone methylation levels defined an
      epigenetic entity that allowed accurate differentiation of cancer and normal
      samples. We observed no correlation of histone methylation levels with
      clinicopathological parameters or patient outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The description
      of a definite epigenetic entity in penile carcinoma provides a rationale for
      testing epigenetic agents in patients with metastatic disease.

TI  - Clinical utility of an epigenetic assay to detect occult prostate cancer in
      histopathologically negative biopsies: results of the MATLOC study.
PG  - 1110-6

LID - S0022-5347(12)04906-3 [pii]
AB  - PURPOSE: Concern about possible false-negative prostate biopsy histopathology
      findings often leads to rebiopsy. A quantitative methylation specific polymerase 
      chain reaction assay panel, including GSTP1, APC and RASSF1, could increase the
      sensitivity of detecting cancer over that of pathological review alone, leading
      to a high negative predictive value and a decrease in unnecessary repeat
      biopsies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MATLOC study blindly tested archived
      prostate biopsy needle core tissue samples of 498 subjects from the United
      Kingdom and Belgium with histopathologically negative prostate biopsies, followed
      by positive (cases) or negative (controls) repeat biopsy within 30 months.
      Clinical performance of the epigenetic marker panel, emphasizing negative
      predictive value, was assessed and cross-validated. Multivariate logistic
      regression was used to evaluate all risk factors. RESULTS: The epigenetic assay
      performed on the first negative biopsies of this retrospective review cohort
      resulted in a negative predictive value of 90% (95% CI 87-93). In a multivariate 
      model correcting for patient age, prostate specific antigen, digital rectal
      examination and first biopsy histopathological characteristics the epigenetic
      assay was a significant independent predictor of patient outcome (OR 3.17, 95% CI
      1.81-5.53). CONCLUSIONS: A multiplex quantitative methylation specific polymerase
      chain reaction assay determining the methylation status of GSTP1, APC and RASSF1 
      was strongly associated with repeat biopsy outcome up to 30 months after initial 
      negative biopsy in men with suspicion of prostate cancer. Adding this epigenetic 
      assay could improve the prostate cancer diagnostic process and decrease
      unnecessary repeat biopsies.

AB  - The estrogen receptor (ER) plays a cardinal role in estrogen-responsive breast
      carcinogenesis. It is, however, unclear as to how estrogen-ER interaction
      potentiates breast cancer progression. Compelling evidence supports
      estrogen-induced redox alterations, such as augmented reactive oxygen species
      (ROS) levels, as having a crucial role in breast carcinogenesis. Despite ER being
      a biological mediator of the majority of estrogen-induced cellular responses; its
      role in estrogen-induced tissue-specific ROS generation remains largely
      debatable. We examined a panel of human breast cancer specimens and found that
      ER-positive breast cancer specimens exhibited a higher incidence of augmented
      O(2)(*-) levels compared to matched normal tissue. ROS are known to function as
      signal transducers and ROS-mediated signaling remains a key complementary
      mechanism that drives carcinogenesis by activating redox-sensitive oncogenic
      pathways. Additional studies revealed that augmented O(2)(*-) levels in breast
      cancer specimens coincided with mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) 
      hyperactivation. Detailed investigations using in vitro experiments established
      that 17beta-estradiol (E2)-stimulated breast cancer cells exhibited transiently
      upregulated O(2)(*-) levels, with the presence of ER being a crucial determinant 
      for the phenomenon to take place. Gene expression, ER transactivation, and
      confocal studies revealed that the E2-induced transient O(2)(*-) upregulation was
      effected by ER through a nongenomic pathway possibly involving mitochondria.
      Furthermore, E2 treatment activated mTORC2 in breast cancer cells in a
      characteristically ER-dependent manner. Interestingly, altering O(2)(*-) anion
      levels through chemical/genetic methods caused significant modulation of the
      mTORC2 signaling cascade. Taken together, our findings unravel a novel nongenomic
      pathway unique to estrogen-responsive breast cancer cells wherein, upon
      stimulation by E2, ER may regulate mTORC2 activity in a redox-dependent manner by
      transiently modulating O(2)(*-) levels particularly within mitochondria. The
      findings suggest that therapies aimed at counteracting these redox alterations
      and/or resultant signaling cascades may complement conventional treatments for
      estrogen-responsive breast cancer.

AB  - Centrosomes are the key regulating element of cell cycle progression. Aberrations
      in their functional mechanism leads to several cancer related disorders. Although
      genomic studies in the field of centrosome have been extensively carried out,
      with the lack of structural conformation, the proteomic analysis of pathological 
      genetic mutation is still a challenging task. Several computational algorithms
      and high range force fields are used to design the 3D structure conformation of
      proteins, which has now become the leading platform for in-silico drug discovery 
      approaches. Application of these highly efficient platforms in centrosomics
      studies will be a novel approach to develop an efficient drug therapy for the
      treatment of their dysfunction disorders.

TI  - Can diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) alone be used as a
      reliable sequence for the preoperative detection and characterisation of hepatic 
      metastases? A meta-analysis.

AB  - PURPOSE: To perform a meta-analysis of all available studies of the diagnostic
      performance of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) in patients
      with hepatic metastases. METHODS: Databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE were
      searched for relevant original articles published from January 2000 to February
      2012. We determined sensitivities and specificities across studies, calculated
      positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-), diagnostic odds ratio
      (DOR) and constructed summary receiver operating characteristic curves using
      hierarchical regression models. RESULTS: Across 11 studies (537 patients), DW-MRI
      sensitivity was 0.87 (95%confidence interval (CI), 0.80, 0.91) and specificity
      was 0.90 (95%CI, 0.86, 0.93). Overall, LR+ was 8.52 (95%CI, 6.17, 11.77), LR- was
      0.15 (95%CI, 0.10, 0.22) and DOR was 57.36 (95%CI, 38.29, 85.93). In studies in
      which both DW-MRI and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) were 
      performed, the comparison of DW-MRI performance with that of CE-MRI suggested no 
      major differences against these two methods (p>0.05). DW-MRI combined CE-MRI had 
      higher sensitivity and specificity than DW-MRI alone (97% versus 86% and 91%
      versus 90%, respectively) (p<0.05). The subgroup in which DW-MRI examinations
      were performed with a 3.0 Tesla (T) device had higher pooled specificity (0.91,
      95%CI, 0.88-0.95) than the subgroup of DW-MRI with 1.5 T device (0.81, 95%CI,
      0.67, 0.94) (p<0.05). Average lesion size (</= 1.5 cm versus >1.5cm) did not
      influence the diagnostic accuracy of the test (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results
      demonstrate DW-MRI has good diagnostic performance in the overall evaluation of
      hepatic metastases and equivalent to CE-MRI. Combination of CE-MRI and DW-MRI can
      improve the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Our study
      further confirms that DW-MRI can accurately detect hepatic metastases regardless 
      of the lesion size. It is suggested to perform DW-MRI by 3.0 T devices, which
      might have high specificity to identify liver metastases.

AB  - I review here the evidence that complex II of the respiratory chain (RC)
      constitutes a general sensor for apoptosis induction. This concept emerged from
      work on neurodegenerative diseases and from recent data on metabolic alterations 
      in cancer cells affecting the RC and in particular on mutations of complex II
      subunits. It is also supported by experiments with many anticancer compounds that
      compared the apoptosis sensitivities of complex II-deficient versus WT cells.
      These results are explained by the mechanistic understanding of how complex II
      mediates the diverse range of apoptosis signals. This protein aggregate is
      specifically activated for apoptosis by pH change as a common and early feature
      of dying cells. This leads to the dissociation of its SDHA and SDHB subunits from
      the remaining membrane-anchored subunits and the consequent block of it enzymatic
      SQR activity, while its SDH activity, which is contained in the SDHA/SDHB
      subcomplex, remains intact. The uncontrolled SDH activity then generates
      excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species for the demise of the cell. Future
      studies on these mitochondrial processes will help refine this model, unravel the
      contribution of mutations in complex II subunits as the cause of degenerative
      neurological diseases and tumorigenesis, and aid in discovering novel
      interference options. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled:
      Respiratory complex II: Role in cellular physiology and disease.

TI  - Integrating comparative effectiveness design elements and endpoints into a phase

      management for women with breast cancer involving lymph nodes.

AB  - Women with breast cancer involving the lymph nodes are typically treated with
      cytotoxic chemotherapy. Retrospective evaluations of prior studies suggest that
      the 21-gene test (OncotypeDX(R)), may allow identification of those who can
      safely avoid chemotherapy. To better understand the performance of the 21-gene
      test, the RxPONDER (Rx for Positive Node, Endocrine Responsive breast cancer)
      study was designed, a multicenter Phase III trial randomizing women with hormone 
      receptor-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer involving 1-3 lymph nodes and a
      21-gene assay recurrence score (RS) of 25 or less to endocrine therapy alone
      versus chemotherapy followed by endocrine therapy. As one of the first
      large-scale comparative-effectiveness studies in oncology, RxPONDER utilized an
      external stakeholder group to help inform the design of the trial. Stakeholders
      met with representatives of SWOG over several months through a structured
      discussion process. The stakeholder engagement process resulted in several
      changes being made to the trial design. In addition, stakeholder representatives 
      from the health insurance industry provided guidance regarding a mechanism
      whereby the costs of OncotypeDX(R) would be paid by the majority of health
      insurers as part of the trial. The process may serve as a template for future
      studies evaluating the comparative effectiveness of genomic tests in oncology,
      particularly those that are conducted within cooperative clinical trials groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and bone
      metastases have an unmet clinical need for effective treatments that improve
      quality of life and survival with a favorable safety profile. OBJECTIVE: To
      prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of three different doses of radium
      chloride (Ra 223) in patients with CRPC and bone metastases. DESIGN, SETTING, AND
      PARTICIPANTS: In this phase 2 double-blind multicenter study, 122 patients were
      randomized to receive three injections of Ra 223 at 6-wk intervals, at doses of
      25 kBq/kg (n=41), 50 kBq/kg (n=39), or 80 kBq/kg (n=42). The study compared the
      proportion of patients in each dose group who had a confirmed decrease of >/= 50%
      in baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Efficacy was evaluated using blood samples to measure PSA
      and other tumor markers, recorded skeletal-related events, and pain assessments. 
      Safety was evaluated using adverse events (AEs), physical examination, and
      clinical laboratory tests. The Jonckheere-Terpstra test assessed trends between
      groups. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The study met its primary end point with a
      statistically significant dose-response relationship in confirmed >/= 50% PSA
      declines for no patients (0%) in the 25-kBq/kg dose group, two patients (6%) in
      the 50-kBq/kg dose group, and five patients (13%) in the 80-kBq/kg dose group
      (p=0.0297). A >/= 50% decrease in bone alkaline phosphatase levels was identified
      in six patients (16%), 24 patients (67%), and 25 patients (66%) in the 25-, 50-, 
      and 80-kBq/kg dose groups, respectively (p<0.0001). The most common
      treatment-related AEs (>/= 10%) occurring up to week 24 across all dose groups
      were diarrhea (21%), nausea (16%), and anemia (14%). No difference in incidence
      of hematologic events was seen among dose groups. Potential limitations include
      small patient numbers and differences among dose groups at baseline. CONCLUSIONS:
      Ra 223 had a dose-dependent effect on serum markers of CRPC activity, suggesting 
      that control of bone disease with Ra 223 may affect cancer-related outcomes. Ra
      223 was well tolerated at all doses. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov:

AB  - Breast cancer is associated to estrogen exposure. Allelic variants involved in
      estrogen metabolism might change the risk of developing this neoplasia. We
      examined the potential association of breast cancer risk in Mexican women with
      the polymorphisms CYP1A1 rs1048943, CYP1B1 rs1056836, COMT rs4680, GSTP1 rs1695, 
      GSTT1 null and GSTM1 null which are involved in estrogen metabolism pathway. This
      study included 150 cases and 150 controls. A significant association was observed
      between, CYP1A1 rs1048943 (OR = 1.95, C.I. 1.13-3.36) and GSTP1 rs1695 (OR =
      2.39, C.I. 1.24-4.24) polymorphisms with the risk of breast cancer. This risk was
      increased when the women were stratified according to their menopausal status.
      The results show that breast cancer risk significantly increases in women with
      3-6 risk polymorphisms (OR = 3.75, C.I. 1.44-9.74).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prostate component of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian
      (PLCO) randomized screening trial demonstrated no mortality effect of screening. 
      Here we analyze prostate cancer specific survival in PLCO and its relation to
      screening. METHODS: 76,693 men aged 55-74 were randomized to usual care (n =
      38,350) or intervention (n = 38,343). Intervention arm men received annual
      prostate-specific antigen (6 years) and digital rectal exam (4 years). Men were
      followed for cancer diagnosis and mortality through 13 years. Medical record
      abstractors confirmed prostate cancer diagnoses, stage and grade.
      Prostate-specific survival in PLCO cases was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis
      and proportional hazards modeling. We utilized data from the Surveillance,
      Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program to compute expected survival in PLCO 
      and compared this to observed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in
      prostate-specific survival rates between arms; 10 year survival rates were 94.7% 
      (intervention, n = 4250 cases) versus 93.5% (usual care, n = 3815 cases). Within 
      the intervention arm, cases never screened in PLCO had lower 10 year survival
      rates (82%) than screen detected or interval (following a negative screen) cases,
      both around 95.5%. The ratio of observed to expected 10 year prostate-specific
      death (1-survival) rates was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.51-0.68) for all PLCO cases, 0.66
      (95% CI: 0.51-0.81) for Gleason 5-7 cases and 1.07 (95% CI: 0.87-1.3) for Gleason
      8-10 cases. CONCLUSION: Prostate cancer specific survival in PLCO was comparable 
      across arms and significantly better than expected based on nationwide population
      data. How much of the better survival is due to a healthy volunteer effect and to
      lead-time and overdiagnosis biases is not readily determinable.

AB  - The alarming national data on the mortality and morbidity rates of cervical
      cancer as well as the results of a Hungarian survey demonstrating adolescents'
      low level of understanding of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV
      vaccination encouraged the authors to conduct an educational intervention. The
      aim of this survey was to explore the impact of a brief, HPV-focused program on
      adolescents' knowledge, beliefs and attitudes. A self-administered anonymous
      questionnaire was completed by 394 male and female adolescents in September,
      2010, in Hungary. Half of the students (48.5%) then had a one-off educational
      intervention on aspects cervical cancer lasting 45 min lesson, while the rest of 
      the participants, the control group, did not have the educational intervention.
      Three months following the education, both groups were retested using the same
      questionnaire. Data were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social
      Sciences (SPSS). Following the education, significant increase was detected in
      cervical cancer awareness: causal relationship between HPV and cervical cancer
      (7.9% --> 22.1%, p<0.05), or perception of HPV vaccination (61.3% --> 85.9%,
      p<0.05). Similarly, health-related beliefs have enhanced, such as 'HPV may cause 
      cervical cancer' (64.9% --> 81.0%, p<0.05) or 'cervical cancer may be prevented
      by vaccination' (66.5% --> 85.3%, p<0.05). Our data also highlighted that
      Hungarian adolescents have been practising extremely risky sexual behaviour.
      Nearly half of the sexually active adolescents had engaged in 'one-night
      relationship' (41.1%) as well as having sexual intercourse without any
      contraceptive safety measures (44.3%). In addition to providing adolescents with 
      clear and meaningful information about the implications of a HPV infection and
      addressing their fears of screening and vaccination, health education should
      focus on promoting safe sex behaviour by promoting the use of condoms and
      reducing the number of sexual partners to limit the spread of HPV, and also on
      encouraging the participation in regular cervical screenings, thus reducing the
      incidence of cervical cancer.

AB  - Polyethylenimine (PEI) and poly(L-lysine) (PLL), which are cationic polymers used
      for gene therapy, are known to be cytotoxic, but their molecular mechanisms of
      cell death are not fully understood. In this study, we provide evidence that PEI 
      and PLL induced autophagy in HeLa cervical cancer cells. In cells overexpressed
      with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain
      3 (LC3) fusion protein, PEI and PLL induced fluorescent puncta formations that
      represent LC3 recruitment to autophagosomes. In Western blot analysis,
      conversions of the LC3-I to LC3-II were significant, and p62 degradation was
      observed in cells treated with PEI and PLL. At higher doses, the ability of
      endosomal escape by PEI facilitates the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II without the
      use of lysosomal protease inhibitors. From the analysis of annexin V-flourescein 
      isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) staining by flow cytometry, both 
      apoptosis and necrosis occurred in PEI- and PLL-treated cells. Significant
      activated caspase-3 expression was detected in PLL- and PEI-treated cells. By
      applying Z-VAD apoptotic inhibition, apoptosis and autophagy may occur
      independently or autophagy may be in the upstream of apoptosis on PEI- and
      PLL-treated cells. The degree of cell death was higher in incubated HeLa cells
      treated with PEI or PLL plus autophagy inhibitors (3-methyladenine (3-MA) and
      wortmannin). Treatment with these autophagy inhibitors, however, did not inhibit 
      LC3-II formation specifically. In addition, PEI and PLL induced higher degree of 
      cell death in atg5(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells than in wild-type 
      cells. Autophagy was also induced in PEI- and PLL-treated MEFs, as evidenced by
      the formation of LC3-II in wild-type-but not in atg5(-/-) MEFs. These results
      indicate that PEI and PLL can trigger both death and survival pathways
      simultaneously, and autophagy played a role in cell survival in PEI- and
      PLL-treated cells. Our study therefore provides deeper insight into the molecular
      mechanisms of cell death caused by cationic polymers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) represents a distinct
      subtype of endometrial cancer. UPSC is less common than endometrioid carcinoma
      (ECC) but accounts for a disproportionate number of uterine cancer related
      deaths. This article critically reviews the literature pertinent to the
      pathology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, management, and outcome of patients with
      UPSC. METHODS: MEDLINE was searched for all research articles published in
      English between January 1, 1967-January 1, 2012 which reported on patients
      diagnosed with UPSC. Given the rarity of this tumor, studies were not limited by 
      design or number of reported patients. RESULTS: UPSC represents a histologically 
      aggressive subtype of endometrial cancer. It commonly presents with extra uterine
      disease involvement which can be identified by comprehensive surgical staging.
      Optimal cytoreduction and systemic platinum/taxane-based adjuvant therapy appear 
      to confer a survival advantage. CONCLUSIONS: UPSC is a biologically distinct
      entity, different from ECC. Future studies should explore the role of targeted
      therapies in the management of UPSC.

      cell lines.

AB  - Matrigel is a medium rich in extracellular matrix (ECM) components used for
      three-dimensional cell culture and is known to alter cellular phenotypes and gene
      expression. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene
      expression and have roles in cancer. While miRNA profiles of numerous cell lines 
      cultured on plastic have been reported, the influence of Matrigel-based culture
      on cancer cell miRNA expression is largely unknown. This study investigated the
      influence of Matrigel on the expression of miRNAs that might facilitate
      ECM-associated cancer cell growth. We performed miRNA profiling by microarray
      using two colon cancer cell lines (SW480 and SW620), identifying significant
      differential expression of miRNAs between cells cultured in Matrigel and on
      plastic. Many of these miRNAs have previously been implicated in cancer-related
      processes. A common Matrigel-induced miRNA signature comprised of up-regulated
      miR-1290 and miR-210 and down-regulated miR-29b and miR-32 was identified using
      RT-qPCR across five epithelial cancer cell lines (SW480, SW620, HT-29, A549 and
      MDA-MB-231). Experimental modulation of these miRNAs altered expression of their 
      known target mRNAs involved in cell adhesion, proliferation and invasion, in
      colon cancer cell lines. Furthermore, ITGA5 was identified as a novel putative
      target of miR-32 that may facilitate cancer cell interactions with the ECM. We
      propose that culture of cancer cell lines in Matrigel more accurately
      recapitulates miRNA expression and function in cancer than culture on plastic and
      thus is a valuable approach to the in vitro study of miRNAs.

AB  - Estrogen receptors are localized in mitochondria, but their functions in this
      organelle remain unclear. We previously found that ERalpha interacted with
      mitochondrial protein HADHB and affected the thiolytic cleavage activity of HADHB
      in beta-oxidation. It is known that ERbeta binds to ERalpha. In addition, ERbeta 
      is predominately located in mitochondria. These facts led us to speculate that
      ERbeta may also be associated with HADHB in mitochondria. In order to test this
      hypothesis, we performed co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy analyses 
      with human breast cancer MCF7 cells. The results demonstrated that ERbeta was
      indeed associated and colocalized with HADHB within mitochondria. Interestingly, 
      in contrast to the stimulatory effect of ERalpha on HADHB enzyme activity
      observed in the previous study, silencing of ERbeta enhanced the enzyme activity 
      of HADHB in the present study, suggesting that ERbeta plays an inhibitory role in
      HADHB enzyme activity in the breast cancer cells. Our results imply that ERalpha 
      and ERbeta may differentially affect cellular oxidative stress through
      influencing the rate of beta-oxidation of fatty acids in breast cancer cells.

AB  - S100A7, a member of S100 calcium binding protein family, is highly associated
      with breast cancer. However, the molecular mechanism of S100A7 regulation remains
      unclear. Here we show that long-term treatment with estradiol stimulated S100A7
      expression in MCF7 breast cancer cells at both the transcriptional and
      translational levels. Both treatment with a histone demethylase LSD1 inhibitor
      and shRNA-based knockdown of LSD1 expression significantly decreased
      17beta-estradiol (E2)-induced S100A7 expression. These reduced E2-mediated S100A7
      expression are rescued by the overexpressed wild-type LSD1 but not by its
      catalytically inactive mutant. Our data showed in vivo association of LSD1 with
      S100A7 promoters, confirming the potential role of LSD1 in regulating S100A7
      expression. S100A7 knockdown increased both normal cell growth and
      estrogen-induced cell proliferation, suggesting a negative influence by S100A7 on
      the growth of cancer cells. Together, our data suggest that estrogen-induced
      S100A7 expression mediated by the histone demethylase LSD1 may downregulate
      breast cancer cell proliferation, implying a potential tumor suppressor-like
      function for S100A7.

AB  - Trp63, a transcription factor related to the tumor suppressor p53, is activated
      by diverse stimuli and can initiate a range of cellular responses. TAp63 is the
      predominant Trp53 family member in primordial follicle oocyte nuclei and is
      essential for their apoptosis triggered by DNA damage in vivo. After
      gamma-irradiation, induction of the proapoptotic BH3-only members Puma and Noxa
      was observed in primordial follicle oocytes from WT and Trp53(-/-) mice but not
      in those from TAp63-deficient mice. Primordial follicle oocytes from mice lacking
      Puma or both Puma and Noxa were protected from gamma-irradiation-induced
      apoptosis and, remarkably, could produce healthy offspring. Hence, PUMA and NOXA 
      are critical for DNA damage-induced, TAp63-mediated primordial follicle oocyte
      apoptosis. Thus, blockade of PUMA may protect fertility during cancer therapy and
      prevent premature menopause, improving women's health.

AB  - Primary adenocarcinoma of lung has replaced squamous cell carcinoma as the
      commonest histological subtype of lung cancer and the incidence of primary lung
      adenocarcinoma appears to be rising. Although the main factors behind this
      'epidemic-like' situation are largely undiscovered, filter cigarettes appear to
      significantly contribute to this shift in the histopathological spectrum. The new
      multidisciplinary classification of adenocarcinoma of lung was introduced to
      address advances in clinical, pathological, radiological and molecular sciences. 
      The purpose of this essay is to discuss various classes of lung adenocarcinoma in
      the new classification with their classical imaging features on computed
      tomography and summarise the recent advances in the field of radiology and review
      radiology recommendations.

AB  - Trastuzumab has shown positive results in many patients with metastatic
      HER2-positive breast cancer, but it is less effective for controlling metastases 
      in the CNS, which remains a site of relapse. The poor prognosis for patients with
      brain metastases is thought to be largely due to the presence of the blood-brain 
      barrier (BBB) that prevents delivery of most drugs to the CNS and to the
      heterogeneous and limited permeability of the blood-tumor barrier (BTB). Focused 
      ultrasound (FUS) bursts combined with circulating microbubbles can temporarily
      permeabilize both the BBB and the BTB. This technique has been investigated as a 
      potential noninvasive method for targeted drug delivery in the brain. Here, we
      investigated whether BBB/BTB permeabilization in the tumor and surrounding brain 
      tissue induced by FUS and microbubbles can slow tumor growth and improve survival
      in a breast cancer brain metastases model. HER2/neu-positive human breast cancer 
      cells (BT474) were inoculated in the brains of 41 nude (nu/nu) rats. Animals in
      the treatment group received six weekly treatments of BTB/BBB permeabilization
      under MRI guidance combined with IV administration of trastuzumab (2 mg/kg).
      Tumor growth and survival rates were monitored via MRI for seven weeks after
      sonication. Starting at week seven and continuing through the end of the study,
      the mean tumor volume of the FUS+trastuzumab group was significantly (P<0.05)
      less than those of the three control groups (no treatment, FUS alone, trastuzumab
      alone). Furthermore, in four out of 10 rats treated with FUS+trastuzumab, the
      tumor appeared to be completely resolved in MRI, an outcome which was not
      observed in any of the 31 rats in three control groups. Trastuzumab improved
      median survival by 13% compared to the no treatment group, a difference which was
      significant (P=0.044). Treatment with FUS+trastuzumab produced the most
      significant benefit compared to the no-treatment controls (P=0.0084). More than
      half (6/10) animals survived at the study endpoint, leading to a median survival 
      time greater than 83 days (at least 32% longer than the untreated control group).
      Overall, this work suggests that BBB/BTB permeabilization induced by FUS and
      microbubbles can improve outcomes in breast cancer brain metastases.

      structural alterations. Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) can
      modulate cell responses to injury through their interactions with soluble
      effector molecules. These interactions are often sulfate specific, and the
      removal of sulfate groups from HS side chains could be expected to influence
      cellular injury, such as that caused by exposure to cadmium. The goal of this
      study was to define the role 6-O-sulfate plays in cellular responses to cadmium
      exposure in two pulmonary epithelial cancer cell lines (H292 and A549) and in
      normal human primary alveolar type II (hAT2) cells. Sulfate levels were modified 
      by transduced transient over-expression of 6-O-endosulfatase (HSulf-1), a
      membrane-bound enzyme which specifically removes 6-O-sulfate groups from HSPG
      side chains. Results showed that cadmium decreased cell viability and activated
      apoptosis pathways at low concentrations in hAT2 cells but not in the cancer
      cells. HSulf-1 over-expression, on the contrary, decreased cell viability and
      activated apoptosis pathways in H292 and A549 cells but not in hAT2 cells. When
      combined with cadmium, HSulf-1 over-expression further decreased cell viability
      and exacerbated the activation of apoptosis pathways in the transformed cells but
      did not add to the toxicity in hAT2 cells. The finding that HSulf-1 sensitizes
      these cancer cells and intensifies the injury induced by cadmium suggests that
      6-O-sulfate groups on HSPGs may play important roles in protection against
      certain environmental toxicants, such as heavy metals.

      non-small cell lung cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), previous studies
      have shown a prognostic benefit of maximum standardized uptake (SUV(max)) values 
      on positron emission tomography (PET). Because tumor size is also prognostic and 
      is associated with SUV(max), we sought to better characterize their relationship.
      We hypothesize that the ratio of SUV(max) to tumor size is a clinically useful
      measurement. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed for patients (tumors
      >/= 1 cm) undergoing resection of NSCLC. Patients were placed into quartiles
      (SUV(max) and SUV(max) to tumor size ratio) and compared for clinical and
      pathologic factors. Predictors of SUV(max) and SUV(max) to tumor size ratio on
      survival were evaluated. RESULTS: Among 530 patients, increasing tumor size (odds
      ratio [OR], 2.04; confidence interval [CI], 1.68-2.47; p < 0.001) was an
      independent predictor of higher SUV(max). Patients in quartiles by the ratio of
      SUV(max) to tumor size demonstrated no significant difference in median tumor
      size. Those patients with the highest ratios (QR4, 3.21-27.5) more frequently had
      poorly differentiated tumors (51%; p < 0.001), were likely to have lymph node
      metastases (30%; p < 0.001), and had poor 3-year disease-free survival (DFS)
      (58%; p = 0.013). On multivariate analysis, as a continuous variable SUV(max) to 
      tumor size ratio was a stronger independent predictor of survival than SUV(max)
      alone (hazard ratio [HR], 1.06; CI, 1.00-1.13 versus HR, 1.02; CI, 0.99-1.06).
      Using cutpoint analysis, a high SUV(max) to tumor size ratio was also a stronger 
      predictor of survival than was high SUV(max) alone, particularly for tumors 1-3
      cm (HR, 1.53; CI, 0.93-2.53 versus HR, 1.15; CI, 0.69-1.93). CONCLUSIONS: The
      ratio of SUV(max) to tumor size may be a more important indicator of prognosis
      than SUV(max) alone in patients with NSCLC. In particular, the use of the ratio
      may be appropriate for identifying patients with small tumors who are at high
      risk for lymph node metastases and poor survival.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) are
      thought to have significant effects on the metabolism of environmental
      carcinogens and thus on lung cancer risk, but the reported results are not always
      consistent. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between
      GSTM1 genetic polymorphism and lung cancer risk in a Chinese population. METHODS:
      A population-based control study was conducted in 360 lung cancer patients and
      360 cancer-free controls. The genotype of the GSTM1 gene was determined by using 
      a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)
      assay. RESULTS: We observed a stronger association between GSTM1 null genotype
      and lung cancer [odds ratio (OR)=1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.17, 2.17;
      P=0.003]. This association was also found in squamous cell carcinoma (OR=1.73,
      95% CI=1.16, 2.59; P=0.008). In the analysis combining GSTM1 polymorphism and
      smoking, smokers with the null genotype who had smoked for >/= 30 pack-years had 
      higher risk (OR=10.06, 95% CI=5.16, 19.61; P<0.001) compared with non-smokers
      with the wild-type genotype. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that GSTM1
      polymorphism plays a role in the development of lung cancer and modifies the risk
      for smoking-related lung cancer in a Chinese population.

TI  - The relationship of vitamin D status, smoking, and colorectal adenoma: a
      retrospective study in an ethnically diverse community.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) level is suggested to be
      negatively correlated with risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and colorectal adenoma
      (CRA), but most of the epidemiological data were originated amongst Caucasians
      and African Americans. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between
      vitamin D status, smoking and CRA in an ethnically diverse community with a high 
      Hispanic density. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included 233 patients 
      who underwent complete colonoscopies from 2009 to 2011, and their serum 25OHD
      levels in the winter season had been measured. Among them, 65 adenoma cases and
      168 adenoma-free controls were identified and evaluated for the association of
      CRA with smoking, ethnicity and serum 25OHD level using unstratified and
      stratified multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: In our study
      participants, the mean serum 25OHD level and the percentage of Hispanics were
      lower in the adenoma group versus the control group, while no black-white
      difference was noted in the CRA prevalence. When adjusted for 25OHD level, the
      lower rate of adenoma in Hispanics compared to non-Hispanics was attenuated and
      became statistically insignificant. A mild protective effect of vitamin D (6%
      reduction) on the CRA risk was found significant for active smokers, but not for 
      non-smokers. A detrimental impact of smoking in the CRA risk was only shown among
      non-Hispanic patients, but not among Hispanics irrespective of vitamin D status. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a marked distinction between Hispanics and
      non-Hispanics in the risk of CRA. The reduced adenoma prevalence among Hispanics 
      vs. non-Hispanics could be partially explained by vitamin D status, cigarette
      smoking and their interactions. Future larger-sized multi-center studies on
      vitamin D status and ethnicity, as well as dietary, behavioral, genetic factors
      and their interactions for CRA and CRC are needed. This article is part of a
      Special Issue entitled 'Vitamin D Workshop'.

AB  - Oxidative stress is a major mediator of tissue and cell injuries. The injury in
      chronic nephrotic syndrome, acute renal failure, myeloma kidney injury and other 
      kidney diseases is initiated by oxidative stress. We have previously demonstrated
      that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) acts as an antiproliferative agent in
      renal cancer cells. This study was designed to evaluate the renoprotective
      activity of VIP against H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative damage in a proximal tubule
      kidney cell line (human, non-tumor, HK2 cells) in order to investigate the
      potential usefulness of this peptide in the treatment of oxidative-stress related
      kidney diseases. HK2 cell viability was assessed by
      3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. Propidium
      iodide was used to identify cells undergoing apoptosis. Western blotting was
      performed with anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bax and anti-formyl peptide receptor
      (low-affinity variant FPRL-1) monoclonal antibodies whereas
      2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate was used for measurement of levels of
      intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). HK2 cells were injured with H(2)O(2)
      in order to induce apoptosis: the effect was time- and dose-dependent. VIP
      increased the levels of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and decreased those of
      the proapoptotic protein Bax. VIP decreased the intracellular ROS levels reached 
      by H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress. VIP effect on ROS levels involved FPLR-1
      but not VPAC(1,2) receptors as evidenced by the use of the respective antagonists
      WRW4 and JV-1-53. Thus, VIP protects HK2 cells from apoptosis by increasing Bcl-2
      levels and this effect is initiated through FPLR1 receptor. In conclusion, VIP
      might exert a renoprotective effect by the suppression of oxidative stress.

AB  - We have identified and characterized a novel proangiogenic glycoprotein (NAP)
      with molecular weight of 67 kDa from synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis
      patients. Proteomic analysis of the protein revealed 29% sequence coverage with
      maximum identity for human retinoblastoma binding protein 2. N-terminal amino
      acid sequence showed no identity to recently discovered protein sequences. NAP
      was also identified in both normal and tumor cell lines by Western blotting. NAP 
      is a permeability factor as verified by miles permeability assay. The
      proangiogenic potential of NAP was identified using shell less CAM, rat cornea
      and tumor on CAM assays. NAP induces expression of VEGF and Flt-1 gene as
      verified by promoter reporter gene analysis. Further NAP induces proliferation of
      endothelial cells and formation of tube like structures. NAP is also involved in 
      migration and invasion of tumor cells. Clinical data revealed the presence of NAP
      in breast cancer biopsies. We have developed monoclonal antibody (mAb), and
      specific ELISA, which confirmed the presence of NAP in the cytosol of tumor
      cells. The mAb effect was evaluated with established angiogenic assays. Further, 
      we investigated the detailed mechanism by which NAP induces angiogenesis. NAP is 
      phosphorylated by VEGF induced activation of MAPK and JNK pathways through VEGFR2
      phosphorylation. NAP involves JNK pathway predominantly with further activation
      of NFkappaB in downstream processing of VEGF activation. Together these findings 
      establish that NAP displays angiogenic properties and promotes efficient
      neovascularization both in vitro and in vivo models. These observations suggest
      that anti-NAP-mAb can be targeted for antiangiogenic therapy of cancer.

AB  - Although the theoretical possibility of oscillations in MAPK signalling has long 
      been described, experimental validation has proven more elusive. In this study we
      observed oscillations in MAPK and PI3K signalling in breast cancer cells in
      response to epidermal growth factor receptor-family stimulation. Using systems
      level analysis with a kinetic model, we demonstrate that receptor amplification, 
      loss of transcriptional feedback, or pathway crosstalk, are responsible for
      oscillations in MAPK and PI3K signalling. Transcriptional profiling reveals
      architectural motifs likely to be responsible for feedback control of
      oscillations. Overexpression of the HER2 oncogene and inhibition of
      transcriptional feedback increase the amplitude of oscillations and provide
      experimental validation of the computational findings.

AB  - Starvation is the most extensively studied condition that induces autophagy.
      Previous studies have demonstrated that starvation-induced autophagy is regulated
      by reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide (O(2)(.-)) but the source for
      ROS under starvation conditions and the downstream signaling pathways regulating 
      autophagy are unclear. In this study, a cervical cancer HeLa cell line was
      generated that was deficient in mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC)
      (HeLa rho degrees cells). This resulted in endogenous levels of O(2)(.-) being
      significantly reduced and failed to be induced under starvation of glucose,
      L-glutamine, pyruvate, and serum (GP) or of amino acids and serum (AA) compared
      to wild type (wt) HeLa cells. In contrast, H(2)O(2) production failed to increase
      under GP starvation in both wild type and rho degrees cells whereas it increased 
      in wt cells but not in rho degrees cells under AA starvation. GP or AA starvation
      induced autophagy was blocked in rho degrees cells as determined by the amount of
      autophagosomes and autolysosomes. Autophagy is regulated by 5' adenosine
      monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and AMPK is activated
      under starvation conditions. We demonstrate that rho degrees cells and HeLa cells
      over expressing manganese-superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) cells fail to activate
      AMPK activation following starvation. This indicates that mitochondrial ROS might
      regulate AMPK activation. In addition, inhibiting AMPK activation either by siRNA
      or compound C resulted in reduced autophagy during starvation. Using a ROS
      scavenger NAC, AMPK activation is reduced under starvation condition and mTOR
      signaling is increased. Taken together, mitochondria-generated ROS induces
      autophagy mediated by the AMPK pathway under starvation conditions.

AB  - Here we studied the cellular mechanisms of ursolic acid's anti-bladder cancer
      ability by focusing on endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) signaling. We
      show that ursolic acid induces a significant ER stress response in cultured human
      bladder cancer T24 cells. ER stress inhibitor salubrinal, or PERK silencing,
      diminishes ursolic acid-induced anti-T24 cell effects. Salubrinal inhibits
      ursolic acid-induced CHOP expression, Bim ER accumulation and caspase-3
      activation in T24 cells. Ursolic acid induces IRE1-TRAF2-ASK1 signaling complex
      formation to activate pro-apoptotic ASK1-JNK signaling. We suggest that ER stress
      contributes to ursolic acid's effects against bladder cancer cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and erythropoietin
      stimulating agents (ESA) may be used to support patients during chemotherapy. We 
      assessed whether G-CSF or ESA were associated with progression or death in
      patients with ovarian cancer. METHODS: Patients with ovarian cancer following
      surgery, were on a protocol to evaluate bevacizumab with chemotherapy. Guidelines
      for administering G-CSF and ESA were specified in the protocol. Overall survival 
      (OS) was analyzed with landmark procedures and multivariate, time-dependent
      hazard models. RESULTS: Eighteen-hundred-seventy-three women were enrolled, with 
      no differences in clinical and pathologic variables among treatment group.
      Performance status, hemoglobin, and white cell counts were associated with G-CSF 
      and/or ESA usage during treatment. Nine patients received no protocol directed
      therapy, leaving 1864 patients for this review.
      One-thousand-one-hundred-twenty-five patients received neither ESA nor G-CSF; 311
      received G-CSF but no ESA; 241 received ESA but no G-CSF; and 187 received both. 
      Median survival following a five month landmark from the start of treatment was
      34 versus 38 months for those who did versus did not receive ESA (multivariate
      hazard ratio: 0.989; 95% confidence interval: 0.849-1.15) and 40 versus 37 months
      for those who did versus did not receive G-CSF (multivariate hazard ratio: 0.932;
      95% confidence interval: 0.800-1.08). CONCLUSIONS: Neither ESA nor G-CSF had a
      negative impact on survival after adjustment of prognostic factors among patients
      with ovarian cancer receiving chemotherapy. ESA may appear to be associated with 
      shorter survival in univariate analyses because factors prognostic for ESA use
      are also prognostic for progression-free survival.

AB  - Due to the increasing incidence of cancer, a leading cause of death worldwide,
      discovery of new therapeutic drugs is urgently needed. By screening for agents
      with low toxicity that selectively target cancer cells, we found that
      6-[(1-naphthylmethyl) sulfanyl]-9H-purine (NMMP), a derivative of
      6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), could reduce the viability of five human cancer cell
      lines. Further study suggested that NMMP inhibition of the proliferation of
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells was associated with G2/M phase cell cycle 
      arrest, and reduced cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and cyclin B1/D1 levels. In
      addition, NMMP induced cell apoptosis, as determined by TUNEL assay. Immunoblot
      analysis revealed that the expression of cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3 as well 
      as the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 protein increased significantly. Overall, our results
      suggest that NMMP exerts anti-tumor activities through induction of G2/M phase
      arrest and mitochondria-dependent cell apoptosis, implicating its potential
      therapeutic value for the treatment of cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Intact cell peptidome profiling (ICPP) with MALDI-ToF Mass
      Spectrometry holds promise as a non-invasive method to detect head and neck
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) objectively, which may significantly improve the 
      early diagnosis of oral cancer. The present study was designed to discriminate
      between tumour samples and non-cancer controls (healthy mucosa and oral lesions) 
      by analysing complete spectral patterns of intact cells using MALDI-ToF MS.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the first step, a database consisting of 26 patients
      suffering from HNSCC was established by taking brush biopsy samples of the
      diseased area and of the healthy buccal mucosa of the respective contralateral
      area. After performing MALDI-ToF MS on these samples, classification analysis was
      used as the basis for further classification of an additional 26 blinded samples 
      including HNSCC, oral lesions and healthy mucosa. RESULTS: By analysing spectral 
      patterns of the blinded samples, all cancerous lesions were defined accurately.
      One incorrect evaluation (false positive) occurred in the lesion cohort, leading 
      to a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 93% and an overall accuracy of 96.5%. 
      CONCLUSION: ICPP using MALDI-ToF MS is able to distinguish between healthy and
      cancerous mucosa and between oral lesions and oral cancer with excellent
      sensitivity and specificity, which may lead to more accurate early diagnosis of
      HNSCC.

AB  - Quercetin is a member of the flavonoid family and has been previously shown to
      have a variety of anti-cancer activities. We and others have reported
      anti-proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and induction of apoptosis of cancer cells
      after treatment with quercetin. Quercetin has also been shown to undergo
      oxidation. However, it is unclear if quercetin or one of its oxidized forms is
      responsible for cell death. Here we report that quercetin rapidly oxidized in
      cell culture media to form a dimer. The quercetin dimer is identical to a dimer
      that is naturally produced by onions. The quercetin dimer and
      quercetin-3-O-glucopyranoside are unable to cross the cell membrane and do not
      kill MDA-MB-231 cells. Finally, supplementing the media with ascorbic acid
      increases quercetin's ability to induce cell death probably by reduction
      oxidative dimerization. Our results suggest that an unmodified quercetin is the
      compound that elicits cell death.

      cell adhesion and invasion in association with alpha-actinin-4.

AB  - High molecular weight kininogen (HK) is a plasma glycoprotein with multiple
      functions, including the regulation of coagulation. We previously demonstrated
      that domain 5 (D5(H)), a functional domain of HK, and its derived peptides played
      an important role in the vitronectin-mediated suppression of cancer cell adhesion
      and invasion. However, the underlying mechanisms of the D5(H)-mediated
      suppressive effects remain to be elucidated. Here, we showed that D5(H) and its
      derivatives inhibited the collagen-mediated cell adhesion and invasion of human
      osteosarcoma MG63 cells. Using purified D5(H) fused to glutathione-S-transferase 
      (GST) and D5(H)-derived peptides for column chromatography, an actin-binding
      protein, alpha-actinin-4, was identified as a binding protein of D5(H) with
      high-affinity for P-5m, a core octapeptide of D5(H). Immunofluorescence
      microscopy demonstrated that D5(H) co-localized with alpha-actinin-4 inside MG63 
      cells. In addition, exogenous GST-D5(H) added to the culture media was
      transported into MG63 cells, although GST alone as a control was not. As
      alpha-actinin-4 regulates actin polymerization necessary for cell adhesion and is
      related to the integrin-dependent attachment of cells to the extracellular
      matrix, our results suggest that D5(H) may modulate cell adhesion and invasion
      together with actinin-4.

AB  - Mithramycin A (Mith) is a natural polyketide that has been used in multiple areas
      of research including apoptosis of various cancer cells. Here, we examined the
      critical role of Mith in apoptosis and its molecular mechanism in DU145 and PC3
      prostate cancer cells and tumor xenografts. Mith decreased cell growth and
      induced apoptosis in DU145 and PC-3 cells. Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) was
      over-expressed in both cell lines compared to RWPE1 cells. Mith inhibited Mcl-1
      protein expression in both cells, but only altered Mcl-1 mRNA levels in PC-3
      cells. We also found that Mith reduced Mcl-1 protein levels through both
      proteasome-dependent protein degradation and the inhibition of protein synthesis 
      in DU145 cells. Studies using siRNA confirmed that the knockdown of Mcl-1 induced
      apoptosis. Mith significantly suppressed TPA-induced neoplastic cell
      transformation through the down-regulation of the Mcl-1 protein in JB6 cells, and
      suppressed the transforming activity of both cell types. Mith also inhibited
      tumor growth and Mcl-1 levels, in addition to inducing apoptosis, in athymic nude
      mice bearing DU145 cell xenografts without affecting five normal organs.
      Therefore, Mith inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis by suppressing Mcl-1
      in both prostate cancer cells and xenograft tumors, and thus is a potent
      anticancer drug candidate for prostate cancer.

AB  - The primo vascular system (PVS), which is composed of very small primo-vessels
      (PV) and primo-nodes (PN), has recently emerged as a third component of
      circulatory system. Here, we report the presence of a tumor derived PVS in murine
      xenografts of human histiocytic lymphoma (U937) in close proximity to the tumor. 
      Within this system, PNs are small (~500-600 muM diameter) membranous sac-like
      structures which contain numerous small cells which can be demonstrated by DAPI
      staining. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining of the peri-tumoral PVS shows the 
      presence of loose structures lined by fibroblasts but filled with dense fibers,
      cells, lacunae and nerve-like structures. The origin and type of cells within the
      PVS was characterized by immunostaining with antibodies for CD68, CD45 and
      lysozyme. The results of these studies reveal that the PVS of the xenograft
      originates from the human U937 tumor cells. qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA isolated
      from PVS cells reveals a striking predominance of human, rather than mouse,
      sequences. Of particular interest, human stem cell specific transcription factors
      were overexpressed, most notably KLF4, an upstream regulator of NANOG which
      maintains the pluripotent and undifferentiated state of stem cells. These results
      suggest that the cells present within the PVS are derived from the human
      xenograft and suggests that the primo-vessels associated with the xenografted
      tumor may provide a safe haven for a select population of cancer stem cells.
      Further understanding of the biological properties of these cells may allow the
      development of new anti-cancer interventions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure the impact of the 2009 US Preventive Services Task Force
      (USPSTF) breast cancer screening recommendation, which recommended against
      routine screening for women aged 40 to 49 and stated that there was "insufficient
      evidence" to recommend screening for women aged 75 and older, on mammography
      rates. METHODS: Self-reported mammography rates were calculated using the
      2006-2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys (n=29,857). The paper reports
      mammography rates by age group (40 to 49, 50 to 74, and 75 and older), adjusted
      for age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and region. The study was
      performed at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, USA in 2012. RESULTS:
      Differences in mammography rates between 2010 and earlier years were not
      significant. Among women aged 40-49, biennial mammography rates declined by -0.5 
      percentage points between 2006 to 2009 and 2010 (95% confidence interval [CI]:
      -3.0 to 1.9; p=0.67). Among women aged 50-74, rates declined by -0.07 percentage 
      points (95% CI: -1.8 to 1.7; p=0.93). Among women aged 75 years and older, rates 
      declined by -0.1 percentage points (95% CI: -4.2 to 3.9; p=0.94). CONCLUSION: The
      revision to the USPSTF breast cancer screening recommendation did not affect
      screening patterns.

AB  - Diet may induce colon carcinogenesis through oxidative or alkylating DNA damage. 
      However, diet may also contain anticarcinogenic compounds that contribute to
      cancer prevention. DNA damage prevention and/or induction of repair are two
      important mechanisms involved in cancer chemoprevention by dietary compounds.
      Hypericum sps. are widely used in traditional medicine to prepare infusions due
      to their beneficial digestive and neurologic effects. In this study, we
      investigated the potential of water extracts from three Hypericum sps. and some
      of their main phenolic compounds to prevent and repair oxidative and alkylating
      DNA damage in colon cells. The results showed that water extracts of Hypericum
      perforatum, Hypericum androsaemum, Hypericum undulatum, quercetin and rutin have 
      protective effect against oxidative DNA damage in HT29 cells. Protective effect
      was also observed against alkylating DNA damage induced by
      methyl-methanesulfonate, except for H. androsaemum. With regard to alkylating
      damage repair H. perforatum, H. androsaemum and chlorogenic acid increased repair
      of alkylating DNA damage by base excision repair pathway. No effect was observed 
      on nucleotide excision repair pathway. Antigenotoxic effects of Hypericum sps.
      may contribute to colon cancer prevention and the high amount of phenolic
      compounds present in Hypericum sps. play an important role in DNA protective
      effects.

AB  - Cardiologists and oncologists today face the daunting challenge of identifying
      patients at risk for late-onset left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction from
      the use of various chemotherapeutic agents. Currently, the most widely used
      method in clinical practice for monitoring the potential of chemotherapy-induced 
      cardiotoxicity is calculation of LV ejection fraction. The use of LV ejection
      fraction to determine whether to continue or discontinue the use of
      chemotherapeutic agents is limited, because decreases in LV ejection fraction
      frequently occur late and can be irreversible. These limitations have led to the 
      exploration of diastolic function and newer modalities that assess myocardial
      mechanics to identify sensitive and specific variables that can predict the
      occurrence of late systolic function. The cancer therapies associated with
      cardiotoxicity are reviewed in this report. Additionally, the authors evaluate
      the role of present-day echocardiographic parameters, complementary noninvasive
      imaging modalities, and biomarkers in the prediction of cardiotoxicity. The
      authors address the evolving role of cardioprotective agents and potential
      therapies to prevent or reverse the progression of LV systolic dysfunction.
      Finally, they provide some ideas regarding future directions to enhance the
      knowledge of predicting late-onset LV systolic dysfunction secondary to cancer
      therapy.

AB  - We demonstrate the first use of the nullomer (absent sequences) approach to drug 
      discovery and development. Nullomers are the shortest absent sequences determined
      in a species, or group of species. By identifying the shortest absent peptide
      sequences from the NCBI databases, we screened several potential anti-cancer
      peptides. In order to improve cell penetration and solubility we added short poly
      arginine tails (5Rs), and initially solubilized the peptides in 1M trehalose. The
      results for one of the absent sequences 9R (RRRRRNWMWC), and its scrambled
      version 9S1R (RRRRRWCMNW) are reported here. We refer to these peptides derived
      from nullomers as PolyArgNulloPs. A control PolyArgNulloP, 124R (RRRRRWFMHW), was
      also included. The lethal effects of 9R and 9S1R are mediated by mitochondrial
      impairment as demonstrated by increased ROS production, ATP depletion, cell
      growth inhibition, and ultimately cell death. These effects increase over time
      for cancer cells with a concomitant drop in IC-50 for breast and prostate cancer 
      cells. This is in sharp contrast to the effects in normal cells, which show a
      decreased sensitivity to the NulloPs over time.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer is a highly fatal disease characterized by a dominant stroma
      formation. Exploring new biological targets, specifically those overexpressed in 
      stroma cells, holds significant potential for the design of specific nanocarriers
      to attain homing of therapeutic and imaging agents to the tumor. In clinical
      specimens of pancreatic cancer, we found increased expression of CD59 in tumor
      associated endothelial cells as well as infiltrating cells in the stroma as
      compared to uninvolved pancreas. We explored this dual targeting effect using
      orthotopic human pancreatic cancer in nude mice. By immunofluorescence analysis, 
      we confirmed the increased expression of Ly6C, mouse homolog of CD59, in tumor
      associated endothelial cells as well as in macrophages within the stroma. We
      decorated the surface of porous silicon nanocarriers with Ly6C antibody. Targeted
      nanocarriers injected intravenously accumulated to tumor associated endothelial
      cells within 15min. At 4h after administration, 9.8+/-2.3% of injected dose/g
      tumor of the Ly6C targeting nanocarriers accumulated in the pancreatic tumors as 
      opposed to 0.5+/-1.8% with non-targeted nanocarriers. These results suggest that 
      Ly6C (or CD59) can serve as a novel dual target to deliver therapeutic agents to 
      the stroma of pancreatic tumors.

AB  - Currently, no curative treatments are available for late-stage metastatic or
      recurrent breast cancer, because the cancer tolerates both chemotherapy and
      endocrine therapy. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of a
      dual-regulated oncolytic adenoviral vector with a novel suicide gene to treat
      breast cancer. Following targeted gene virotherapy of conditionally replicating
      adenoviruses (CRAds), the novel suicide gene of multisubstrate
      deoxyribonucleoside kinase of Drosophila melanogaster (Dm-DNK) was inserted into 
      the double-regulated oncolytic adenovirus SG500 to ensure more safety and
      enhanced antitumor activity against breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo.
      Selective replication, cell-killing efficacy, and cytotoxicity, combined with
      chemotherapeutics were investigated in several breast cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and 
      MCF-7), normal cells (WI-38 and MRC-5), and human (MDA-MB-231) tumor models in
      vivo. The double-regulated SG500-dNK had high cell-killing activity in breast
      cancer. Replication was similar to wild-type in breast cells and was attenuated
      in normal cells. SG500-dNK combined with the chemotherapeutics
      (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (Bvdu) and 2',2'-difluoro-deoxycytidine
      (dFdC) resulted in synergistically enhanced cell killing and greatly improved
      antitumor efficacy in vitro or in breast xenografts in vivo. These data suggest
      that the novel oncolytic variant SG500-dNK is a promising candidate for targeting
      breast tumors specifically when combined with chemotherapeutics.

AB  - The anti-malarial activity of the cancer chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin and
      cisplatin analogues was determined in Plasmodium falciparum. The cisplatin
      analogues included DNA-targeted acridine-tethered platinum compounds, carboplatin
      and transplatin. A [(3)H]-hypoxanthine incorporation assay was utilised to
      determine the IC(50) of cisplatin and related analogues. The DNA-targeted Pt
      compounds and cisplatin were shown to have IC(50) values that were less than 1
      muM in P. falciparum, with the acridine-tethered compounds having the greatest
      cytotoxicity. Carboplatin and transplatin had IC(50) values of 12 and 16 muM,
      respectively. The outcome for transplatin was particularly interesting since it
      is not cytotoxic in mammalian cells. These results were discussed with respect to
      the potential use of cisplatin and cisplatin analogues as anti-malarial agents.

TI  - Porphyrin binding mechanism is altered by protonation at the loops in
      G-quadruplex DNA formed near the transcriptional activation site of the human
      c-kit gene.

AB  - BACKGROUND: G-quadruplex DNA structures are hypothesized to be involved in the
      regulation of gene expression and telomere homeostasis. The development of small 
      molecules that modulate the stability of G-quadruplex structures has a potential 
      therapeutic interest in cancer treatment and prevention of aging. METHODS:
      Molecular absorption and circular dichroism spectra were used to monitor thermal 
      denaturation, acid base titration and mole ratio experiments. The resulting data 
      were analyzed by multivariate data analysis methods. Surface plasmon resonance
      was also used to probe the kinetics and affinity of the DNA-drug interactions.
      RESULTS: We investigated the interaction between a G-quadruplex-forming sequence 
      in the human c-kit proto-oncogene and the water soluble porphyrin TMPyP4. The
      role of cytosine and adenine residues at the loops of G-quadruplex was studied by
      substitution of these residues by thymidines. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we show the
      existence of two binding modes between TMPyP4 and the considered G-quadruplex.
      The stronger binding mode (formation constant around 107) involves end-stacking, 
      while the weaker binding mode (formation constant around 106) is probably due to 
      external loop binding. Evidence for the release of TMPyP4 upon protonation of
      bases at the loops has been observed. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results may be
      used for the design of porphyrin-based anti-cancer molecules with a higher
      affinity to G-quadruplex structures which may have anticancer properties.

AB  - In the early years of the molecular biology revolution, cancer research was
      mainly focused on genetic changes (ie, those that altered DNA sequences).
      Although this has been extremely useful as our understanding of the pathogenesis 
      and biology of cancer has grown and matured, there is another realm in tumor
      development that does not involve changing the sequence of cellular DNA. This
      field is called "epigenetics" and broadly encompasses changes in the methylation 
      of cytosines in DNA, changes in histone and chromatin structure, and alterations 
      in the expression of microRNAs, which control the stability of many messenger
      RNAs and serve as "master regulators" of gene expression. This review focuses on 
      the epigenetics of colorectal cancer and illustrates the impact epigenetics has
      had on this field.

AB  - A magnetic nano-sized carrier for 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) was prepared by
      using Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles as cores and chitosan (CS) as a polymeric shell by 
      a novel reverse ultrasonic emulsification method. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
      chains were then coupled onto the magnetic particles (CS-Fe(3)O(4)) to improve
      their biocompatibility (PEG-CS-Fe(3)O(4)). HCPT was loaded onto PEG-CS-Fe(3)O(4) 
      by a subtle precipitation method. Under optimum conditions, the CS-Fe(3)O(4) was 
      close to spherical in shape with an average size of 174 nm and a high saturated
      magnetization. After coupling PEG chains, the unspecific adsorption of bovine
      serum albumin (BSA) on PEG-CS-Fe(3)O(4) decreased significantly. The drug loading
      content and loading efficiency were 9.8-11.8% and 49-59% for magnetic composite
      nanoparticles, respectively. HCPT-loaded magnetic composite nanoparticles showed 
      sustained release profiles up to 48 h, and the cumulative release amount of HCPT 
      from nanoparticles at 45 degrees C increased significantly compared to that at 37
      degrees C. Cytotoxicity assay suggests that CS-Fe(3)O(4) does not exhibit
      noteworthy cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells, but the antitumor activities of
      HCPT-loaded magnetic composite nanoparticles against HepG2 cells increased
      significantly in comparison with that of pristine HCPT powder. These results
      reveal the promising potential of PEG-CS-Fe(3)O(4) as a stable magnetic targeting
      drug carrier in cancer therapy.

AB  - Folate-conjugated Dol-poly(D,L-lactic acid)-b-poly (ethylene glycol)-folate
      (Dol-PLA-PEG-FA), was synthesized from dodecanol-poly(D,L-lactic acid),
      amino-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) and folate. (1)H NMR proved the successful
      synthesis of Dol-PLA-PEG-FA. Nanoparticles (NPs) were further fabricated from
      Dol-PLA-PEG-FA by using solvent evaporation-induced interfacial self-assembly
      method. The size, critical micelle concentration (CMC), cytotoxicity and
      selecting capability to cancer cells in vitro were examined for Dol-PLA-PEG-FA
      NPs. The size of NPs showed polymer concentration-dependent phenomenon in the
      fabrication process, and its polydispersity index (PDI) was very narrow. The CMC 
      was determined as 1.995x10(-4) g/L in aqueous solution, which is much lower than 
      the reported CMC of block copolymer self-assemble micelles. The cytotoxicity
      evaluation revealed that the obtained NPs2 are non-toxic to either breast cancer 
      cell or normal endothelial cells, and the cell uptake of NPs indicated that the
      NPs demonstrated much higher selecting capability to breast cancer cells compared
      to normal fibroblast cells. The possible receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway
      mechanism was proposed. Based on the above results, it could be concluded that
      Dol-PLA-PEG-FA polymer and its nanoparticles can be potentially used as a safe
      drug carrier with strong tumor cells targeting capability for tumor chemotherapy.

TI  - Targeting the TGFbeta signalling pathway in disease.
PG  - 790-811
LID - 10.1038/nrd3810 [doi]
AB  - Many drugs that target transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) signalling have 
      been developed, some of which have reached Phase III clinical trials for a number
      of disease applications. Preclinical and clinical studies indicate the utility of
      these agents in fibrosis and oncology, particularly in augmentation of existing
      cancer therapies, such as radiation and chemotherapy, as well as in tumour
      vaccines. There are also reports of specialized applications, such as the
      reduction of vascular symptoms of Marfan syndrome. Here, we consider why the
      TGFbeta signalling pathway is a drug target, the potential clinical applications 
      of TGFbeta inhibition, the issues arising with anti-TGFbeta therapy and how these
      might be tackled using personalized approaches to dosing, monitoring of
      biomarkers as well as brief and/or localized drug-dosing regimens.

TI  - Narrow band imaging in endoscopic evaluation of the larynx.
PG  - 472-6
LID - 10.1097/MOO.0b013e32835908ac [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Narrow band imaging (NBI) is a novel endoscopic technique
      using filtered wavelengths in order to enhance the microvascular abnormalities
      associated with the preneoplastic and neoplastic changes of the mucosal lining of
      the upper aerodigestive tract. The present review is focused on the use of NBI in
      the management of patients with laryngeal cancer. RECENT FINDINGS: The larynx and
      hypopharynx represent an ideal site for NBI application because their thin,
      nonkeratinized, stratified squamous epithelium permits optimal visualization of
      the subtle neoangiogenic changes associated with precancerous and neoplastic
      diseases, including benign processes like recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.
      These abnormal vascular patterns have been recently described in great detail and
      demonstrated to be useful diagnostic tools in different settings of laryngeal
      cancer management: from preoperative diagnosis and staging to intraoperative
      evaluation of microsurgical margins and posttreatment follow-up. Particularly
      intriguing is the capacity of NBI to properly distinguish postactinic changes
      from persistent/recurrent disease. SUMMARY: From different institutions in
      several countries, NBI continues to receive confirmations of its validity as an
      ancillary diagnostic tool for endoscopic evaluation of oncologic patients. This
      also holds true for laryngeal and hypopharyngeal neoplastic diseases.

TI  - [Role of Wnt5a and LMP1 in the nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis by high-throughput
      tissue microarray technology].
PG  - 865-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular mechanism of Wnt5a and Epstein-Barr virus
      latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) aberrant expression in the nasopharyngeal
      carcinogenesis and to estimate if it can act as a molecular marker for
      nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). METHODS: Immunohistochemistry combined with
      previously made tissue microarrays were used to study the expression of Wnt5a and
      LMP1 in the nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis tissues. We investigated the role of
      over expression of Wnt5a and LMP1 in the development and progression of NPC and
      their relation with the clinicopathological features of NPC and whether they
      could act as molecular markers in benign and malignant NPC. RESULTS: The positive
      percentage of Wnt5a and LMP1 protein expression in the NPC was significantly
      increased as compared with that in atypically hyperplastic nasopharyngeal
      epithelium, hyperplastic nasopharyngeal epithelium and histologically normal
      nasopharyngeal epithelium (P<0.05, P<0.01, and P<0.01). Wnt5a and LMP1 proteins
      were significantly higher in atypically hyperplastic nasopharyngeal epithelium
      than those in the hyperplastic nasopharyngeal epithelium and normal
      nasopharyngeal epithelium (P<0.05 and P<0.01). The positive expression of Wnt5a
      and LMP1 proteins in clinical T3 and T4 staged NPC was higher than that in
      clinical T1 and T2 staged NPC (P<0.01 and P<0.05). The positive expression of
      Wnt5a protein in the NPC with lymph node metastasis was higher than that in the
      NPC without lymph node metastasis (P<0.01). The positive percentage of LMP1
      protein was significantly increased in non-keratinizing carcinoma compared with
      undifferentiated carcinoma and keratinizing carcinoma (P<0.05 and P<0.05). The
      expression of Wnt5a protein in the NPC had significant positive correlation with 
      LMP1 (r=0.354, P<0.001). Combined molecular phenotype of both Wnt5a and LMP1
      expression was a good marker to distinguish NPC from non-cancerous nasopharyngeal
      epithelium. CONCLUSION: The expression of Wnt5a and LMP1 protein in the NPC is
      positively correlated, and both wnt5a and LMP1 protein play important roles in
      the nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis either together or successively promoting the
      malignant transformation of nasopharyngeal epithelium and the development and
      progression of NPC. Both Wnt5a and LMP1 positive expression may act as good
      markers for NPC differential diagnosis.

      cells].
PG  - 876-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct the RNAi targeting tumor necrosis factor receptor
      associated factor (TRAF1) gene, and to explore the effect of interference
      targeting TRAF1 on the biological behavior of gastric cancer cells. METHODS: We
      detected the expression of TRAF1 in BGC823, SGC7901, and MGC803 gastric cancer
      cell lines through the real-time PCR and Western blot; then we constructed three 
      pLVXshRNA- TRAF1-shRNAs expression vector targeting TRAF1. When TRAF1 was
      interfered successfully, we selected the strongest interference efficiency ShRNA 
      by real-time PCR and Western blot. Based on interference targeting TRAF1 on
      gastric cancer, we tested the cell proliferation activity and apoptosis through
      MTT assay and flow cytometry, and the cell migration by transwell migration
      assay. RESULTS: The expression of TRAF1 was increased in BGC823, SGC7901, and
      MGC803 gastric cancer cell lines compared with gastric epithelial cells (P<0.05),
      and the highest expression was in BGC823 gastric cell line. In the three TRAF1
      shRNAs, the strongest interference efficiency shRNA was pLVX-shRNA-TRAF1-shRNA2. 
      When the gene TRAF1 of BGC823 was interfered, the cell growing power was weakened
      and the apoptosis rate increased, and the cell migration had no difference.
      CONCLUSION: The expression of TRAF1 is up-regulated in gastric cancer cell lines 
      BGC823, SGC7901, and MGC803, and the most obvious one is BGC823. The interference
      targeting TRAF1 can successfully inhibit the expression of TRAF1 in gastric
      cancer cell line BGC823. TRAF1 can inhibit the apoptosis of BGC823 cells.

      human pancreatic cancer cells].
PG  - 883-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the simultaneous inhibition of X-linked inhibitor of
      apoptosis protein (XIAP) and survivin expression on epithelial-mesenchymal
      transition (EMT) and invasiion of pancreatic cancer cells Panc-1, and its
      mechanism. METHODS: On the established human pancreatic cancer cells Panc-1-XS,
      the expression of XIAP and survivin was inhibited simultaneously. Cell invasion
      and migration were detected by Transwell chamber experiments and scratch test,
      and the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, mesenchymal markers Slug,
      phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) and P-Akt protein
      was determined by Western blot. RESULTS: Cell invasion and migration of Panc-1-XS
      cells decreased significantly, accompanied by significantly upregulated protein
      expression of E-cadherin, and significantly declined protein expression of the
      Slug, indicating increased mesenchymal-epithelial conversion (MET); and increased
      protein expression of PTEN, and declined protein expression of P-Akt. CONCLUSION:
      Simultaneously inhibiting the expression of XIAP and survivin can partially
      reverse EMT phenotype of pancreatic cancer Panc-1 cells, which then significantly
      reduces the cell invasion and migration of Panc-1 cell lines. This process may be
      regulated by PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between activity of BRAF and
      mitogen-activated protein/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) /
      extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signal pathway in papillary thyroid
      cancer and its mechanism. METHODS: We collected the clinical data and blood
      samples from 73 cases of papillary thyroid cancer and another 16 cases of benign 
      thyroid gland tumor, and detected the expression of rat sarcoma (RAS), BRAF,
      MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 in all tumor specimens and benign thyroid tissues with
      immunohistochemistry and Western blot. RESULTS: The expression of RAS, BRAF,
      pMEK1/2, and pERK1/2 protein in papillary thyroid cancer tissues was higher than 
      those in the benign thyroid tissues(P<0.05 or P<0.01). The expression of RAS,
      BRAF, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 was associated with the tumor size, the lymph node
      metastasis, and the clinical stage of papillary thyroid cancer(P<0.05 or P<0.01).
      CONCLUSION: The expression of RAS, BRAF, pMEK1/2, and pERK1/2 is associated with 
      the pathogenesis, the lymph node metastasis, and the clinical stage of papillary 
      thyroid cancer. The MEK/ERK signaling pathway may be activated by BRAF in
      papillary thyroid cancer.

      cancer and to analyze the prognosis factors. METHODS: From October 2011 to
      January 2012, 1635 post-surgery lung cancer patients from January 2002 to August 
      2011 were followed up by telephone interview. The data from follow-up and
      clinical characteristics were collected and analyzed. Among these patients, 116
      patients with complete and reliable clinical data were further analyzed to
      determine the effective factors of lung cancer metastasis and long-term survival.
      RESULTS: The average response rate in the follow-up was 36.1%, and the response
      rate was related to the interval time after the operations. The shorter the
      interval, the higher the response rate. The response rate in female patients was 
      higher than that in male patients (P<0.001).The response rate was higher in
      patients younger than 40 (56 %) than that in the patients aged between 50-59 and 
      over 60 (39% and 24% respectively, P<0.001). There was no statistical difference 
      between patients from urban and rural areas (P=0.844). In the 116 patients with
      complete and reliable clinical data, statistical analysis confirmed that the
      metastasis and high lymph node staging were factors to increase patients' risk of
      death (with odd ratio 0.212 and 1.818 respectively, P<0.001). The adenocarcinoma 
      grade, high lymph node staging and advanced age were related to the metastasis
      risk (odds ratio 2.353, 2.181 and 2.908, respectively). CONCLUSION: Time, gender 
      and age are the influencing factors in the telephone follow-up. Metastasis, lymph
      node metastasis, pathologic type and age are related to the lung cancer prognosis
      in the small-scale sample.

TI  - Occupational trichloroethylene exposure and kidney cancer risk: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 858-67
LID - 10.1136/oemed-2012-100932 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Inconsistent epidemiological findings, debate over interpretation,
      and extrapolation of findings from animal studies to humans have produced
      uncertainty surrounding the carcinogenicity of trichloroethylene (TCE) exposure
      in occupational settings. We updated meta-analyses of published case-control and 
      cohort studies exploring occupational TCE exposure and kidney cancer risk,
      incorporating new analytical results from three recently published cohort studies
      and a case-control study. METHODS: PubMed MEDLINE was searched for studies
      published from 1950 to 2011 assessing occupational exposure to chlorinated
      solvents, degreasers or TCE. All cohort (N=15) and case-control (N=13) studies
      included in analyses were stratified by assessment of occupational exposure to
      TCE specifically and to any chlorinated solvent. RESULTS: Significantly elevated 
      summary estimates were observed for cohort studies (relative risk (RR) 1.26, 95% 
      CI 1.02 to 1.56; p heterogeneity=0.65), case-control studies (OR 1.35, 95% CI
      1.17 to 1.57; p heterogeneity=0.41), and cohort and case-control studies combined
      (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.50, p heterogeneity=0.63) that specifically assessed
      TCE exposure after excluding outlier studies that contributed to heterogeneity.
      Non-significantly elevated summary estimates were generally observed for studies 
      of workers exposed to chlorinated solvents but who were not assessed for TCE
      specifically. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of study design, significant and stronger
      estimates were only observed in studies specifically assessing occupational
      exposure to TCE. Estimates were lower in studies assessing occupational exposure 
      to chlorinated solvents. This updated meta-analysis supports an association
      between occupational TCE exposure and kidney cancer and provides evidence that
      exposure misclassification may weaken estimates assessing exposure to the broader
      class of chlorinated solvents.

TI  - A systematic review and meta-analysis of pretherapeutic lymph node staging of
      colorectal cancer by 18F-FDG PET or PET/CT.
PG  - 1127-33
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to conduct a systematic review and
      meta-analysis of the published literature to evaluate the diagnostic performance 
      of fluorine-18 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) PET in the pretherapeutic
      assessment of nodal staging in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). We
      conducted a systematic MEDLINE search of articles in the published literature
      (last update, February 2012). Two reviewers independently assessed the
      methodological quality of each study. We estimated pooled sensitivity,
      specificity, summary receiver operating characteristic curves, and summary
      likelihood ratios. A total of 409 patients from 10 studies were analyzed. The
      pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and
      negative likelihood ratio of 18F-FDG PET [PET/computed tomography (CT)] in the
      detection of pretherapeutic lymph node involvement in patients with CRC were
      42.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 36.0-50.0%], 87.9% (95% CI: 82.6-92.0%),
      2.82 (95% CI: 1.96-4.07), and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.62-0.78), respectively. There is no
      solid evidence to support the routine clinical application of 18F-FDG PET
      (PET/CT) in the pretherapeutic evaluation of lymph node status in patients with
      CRC. However, 18F-FDG PET (PET/CT) could be used to strengthen the possibility of
      suspected metastatic lymph nodes detected by other imaging modalities.

TI  - Optical imaging of kidney cancer with novel near infrared heptamethine
      carbocyanine fluorescent dyes.
PG  - 702-710
LID - 10.1016/j.juro.2012.09.056 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We assessed the application of near infrared heptamethine carbocyanine
      dyes, including IR-783 and the synthetic analogue MHI-148, as optical imaging
      agents for the rapid detection of human kidney cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      uptake, retention and subcellular localization of these organic dyes were
      investigated in cultured kidney cancer cells. Tumor specificity of dye uptake and
      retention was evaluated by whole body imaging of mice bearing human kidney cancer
      xenografts or freshly harvested clinical kidney cancer specimens. In addition,
      dye accumulation at the tissue and cellular levels was confirmed by ex vivo
      studies with results confirmed by fluorescence imaging of frozen tissue sections.
      Peripheral blood spiked with kidney cancer cells was stained to simulate the
      detection of circulating tumor cells. RESULTS: Preferential uptake and retention 
      of carbocyanine near infrared dyes was observed in cultured human kidney cancer
      cells, human kidney cancer cell spiked whole blood, human kidney cancer
      xenografts and freshly harvested human kidney cancer tissues compared to normal
      kidney epithelial cells and normal host organs. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a new
      class of near infrared heptamethine carbocyanine dyes that show potential for
      detecting kidney cancer cells in circulating blood and kidney cancer cells in
      clinical specimens. Near infrared carbocyanine dyes can be further developed as
      dual modality agents for deep tissue imaging of localized and disseminated kidney
      cancer in patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: Salvage robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy is a treatment
      option for certain patients with recurrent prostate cancer after primary therapy.
      Data regarding patient selection, complication rates and cancer outcomes are
      scarce. We report the largest, single institution series to date, to our
      knowledge, of salvage robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: We reviewed our database of 4,234 patients treated with robotic assisted
      laparoscopic prostatectomy at Vanderbilt University and identified 34 men who had
      surgery after the failure of prior definitive ablative therapy. Each patient had 
      biopsy proven recurrent prostate cancer and no evidence of metastases. The
      primary outcome measure was biochemical failure. RESULTS: Median time from
      primary therapy to salvage robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy was 48.5
      months with a median preoperative prostate specific antigen of 3.86 ng/ml. Most
      patients had Gleason scores of 7 or greater on preoperative biopsy, although 12
      (35%) had Gleason 8 or greater disease. After a median followup of 16 months 18% 
      of patients had biochemical failure. The positive margin rate was 26%, of which
      33% had biochemical failure after surgery. On univariable analysis there was a
      significant association between prostate specific antigen doubling time and
      biochemical failure (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60-0.99, p = 0.049) as well as between
      Gleason score at original diagnosis and biochemical failure (HR 3.49, 95% CI
      1.18-10.3, p = 0.023). There were 2 Clavien II-III complications, namely a
      pulmonary embolism and a rectal laceration. Postoperatively 39% of patients had
      excellent continence. CONCLUSIONS: Salvage robotic assisted laparoscopic
      prostatectomy is safe, with many favorable outcomes compared to open salvage
      radical prostatectomy series. Advantages include superior visualization of the
      posterior prostatic plane, modest blood loss, low complication rates and short
      length of stay.

AB  - In the last 2 decades the introduction new biologic agents such as tumor necrosis
      factor alpha inhibitors has resulted in potent disease modifying effects in a
      variety of immune-mediated diseases. In addition, there were major advancements
      in cancer treatment due to chemotherapeutic agents including granulocyte
      macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, interferon, epidermal growth factor
      receptor inhibitors, and kinase inhibitors for the treatment of hematologic
      malignancies as well as solid tumors. However, a variety of toxicities including 
      cutaneous reactions is seen in association with these agents. Awareness of
      commonly associated skin toxicities and recognition of corresponding histologic
      features is of importance.

TI  - Clinical outcomes of chemotherapy for diabetic and nondiabetic patients with
      pancreatic cancer: better prognosis with statin use in diabetic patients.
PG  - 202-8

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to clarify the impact of diabetes mellitus 
      (DM) as well as antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and antihyperlipidemic
      medications such as metformin and statins on survival in patients with advanced
      pancreatic cancer receiving chemotherapy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed
      the medical records of 250 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer receiving
      chemotherapy. Multivariate analyses of prognostic factors for survival were
      performed both in overall population and in subgroups with and without DM.
      RESULTS: Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in 124 patients (50%) who had less
      distant metastasis and more hypertension. Thirty patients received statin for
      hyperlipidemia. Overall survival was 13.3 versus 10.0 months with and without DM 
      (P = 0.084), but hazard ratio of DM was 1.05 (P = 0.758) in the multivariate
      analysis. Subgroup analysis of diabetic patients, but not in non-diabetic
      patients, demonstrated use of statins (hazard ratio, 0.40; P = 0.010) as a
      prognostic factor, as well as distant metastasis, performance status, combination
      therapy with gemcitabine and S-1, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme
      inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. No antidiabetic medications were
      prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Neither DM nor antidiabetic treatment had
      prognostic impact on advanced pancreatic cancer. Statin use was associated with
      better survival in the diabetic patients.

TI  - The flavonoid quercetin inhibits pancreatic cancer growth in vitro and in vivo.
PG  - 223-9
LID - 10.1097/MPA.0b013e318264ccae [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The flavonoid quercetin holds promise as an antitumor agent in
      several preclinical animal models. However, the efficacy of oral administration
      of quercetin in a pancreatic cancer mouse model is unknown. METHODS: The
      antiproliferative effects of quercetin alone or in combination with gemcitabine
      were tested in 2 human pancreatic cancer cell lines using cell count and MTT
      assays. Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry. Tumor growth in vivo was
      investigated in an orthotopic pancreatic cancer animal model using
      bioluminescence. Quercetin was administered orally in the diet. RESULTS:
      Quercetin inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer cell lines, which was caused 
      by an induction of apoptosis. In addition, dietary supplementation of quercetin
      attenuated the growth of orthotopically transplanted pancreatic xenografts. The
      combination of gemcitabine and quercetin had no additional effect compared with
      quercetin alone. In vivo quercetin caused significant apoptosis and reduced tumor
      cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence that oral
      administration of quercetin was capable of inhibiting growth of orthotopic
      pancreatic tumors in a nude mouse model. These data suggest a possible benefit of
      quercetin in patients with pancreatic cancer.

TI  - Prevalence of diabetes mellitus in pancreatic cancer compared to common cancers.
PG  - 198-201
LID - 10.1097/MPA.0b013e3182592c96 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In pancreatic cancer (PaC), the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM),
      especially new-onset DM (</=36 months of PaC diagnosis), is high. To determine if
      this observation is unique to PaC, we compared the prevalence and characteristics
      of DM in lung, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers with PaC and noncancer
      controls. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 500
      consecutive patients with cancer (100 each with lung, breast, prostate, and
      colorectal cancers and PaC) and 100 noncancer controls. RESULTS: Patients with
      PaC (mean age +/- SD, 71.6 +/- 9.4 years; 53% men) had a significantly (P <
      0.0001) higher prevalence of DM (68%) compared to age-matched patients with lung 
      (mean age +/- SD, 71.6 +/- 9.4 years; 59% men; and 19.6% DM), breast (mean age
      +/- SD, 71.6 +/- 9.6 years; 100% women; and 19.4% DM), prostate (mean age +/- SD,
      71.3 +/- 9.4 years; 100% men; and 14.8% DM), and colorectal cancer (mean age +/- 
      SD, 71.6 +/- 9.5 years; 56% men; and 20.7% DM), and noncancer controls (mean age 
      +/- SD, 70.7 +/- 9.2 years; 57% men; and 23.5% DM). Among the patients with PaC, 
      40% developed DM in the 36 months preceding the diagnosis of PaC compared with
      3.3% to 5.7% in the other groups (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Whereas the
      prevalence of DM in PaC is very high, DM prevalence in other common cancers is no
      different from that in noncancer controls. In particular, new-onset DM is a
      phenomenon that is unique to PaC.

TI  - Comprehensive molecular portraits of human breast tumours.
PG  - 61-70
LID - 10.1038/nature11412 [doi]
AB  - We analysed primary breast cancers by genomic DNA copy number arrays, DNA
      methylation, exome sequencing, messenger RNA arrays, microRNA sequencing and
      reverse-phase protein arrays. Our ability to integrate information across
      platforms provided key insights into previously defined gene expression subtypes 
      and demonstrated the existence of four main breast cancer classes when combining 
      data from five platforms, each of which shows significant molecular
      heterogeneity. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3)
      occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancers; however, there were
      numerous subtype-associated and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of 
      specific mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the luminal A subtype. We
      identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups, possibly produced by
      stromal/microenvironmental elements, and integrated analyses identified specific 
      signalling pathways dominant in each molecular subtype including a
      HER2/phosphorylated HER2/EGFR/phosphorylated EGFR signature within the
      HER2-enriched expression subtype. Comparison of basal-like breast tumours with
      high-grade serous ovarian tumours showed many molecular commonalities, indicating
      a related aetiology and similar therapeutic opportunities. The biological finding
      of the four main breast cancer subtypes caused by different subsets of genetic
      and epigenetic abnormalities raises the hypothesis that much of the clinically
      observable plasticity and heterogeneity occurs within, and not across, these
      major biological subtypes of breast cancer.

TI  - Crystal structure of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein from Caenorhabditis
      elegans.
PG  - 566-9
LID - 10.1038/nature11448 [doi]
AB  - P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an ATP-binding cassette transporter that confers
      multidrug resistance in cancer cells. It also affects the absorption,
      distribution and clearance of cancer-unrelated drugs and xenobiotics. For these
      reasons, the structure and function of P-gp have been studied extensively for
      decades. Here we present biochemical characterization of P-gp from Caenorhabditis
      elegans and its crystal structure at a resolution of 3.4 angstroms. We find that 
      the apparent affinities of P-gp for anticancer drugs actinomycin D and paclitaxel
      are approximately 4,000 and 100 times higher, respectively, in the membrane
      bilayer than in detergent. This affinity enhancement highlights the importance of
      membrane partitioning when a drug accesses the transporter in the membrane.
      Furthermore, the transporter in the crystal structure opens its drug pathway at
      the level of the membrane's inner leaflet. In the helices flanking the opening to
      the membrane, we observe extended loops that may mediate drug binding, function
      as hinges to gate the pathway or both. We also find that the interface between
      the transmembrane and nucleotide-binding domains, which couples ATP hydrolysis to
      transport, contains a ball-and-socket joint and salt bridges similar to the
      ATP-binding cassette importers, suggesting that ATP-binding cassette exporters
      and importers may use similar mechanisms to achieve alternating access for
      transport. Finally, a model of human P-gp derived from the structure of C.
      elegans P-gp not only is compatible with decades of biochemical analysis, but
      also helps to explain perplexing functional data regarding the Phe335Ala mutant. 
      These results increase our understanding of the structure and function of this
      important molecule.

TI  - Intraepithelial paracrine Hedgehog signaling induces the expansion of ciliated
      cells that express diverse progenitor cell markers in the basal epithelium of the
      mouse mammary gland.
PG  - 28-44

AB  - The Hedgehog signaling pathway regulates embryo patterning and progenitor cell
      homeostasis in adult tissues, including epidermal appendages. A role for the Hh
      pathway in mammary biology and breast cancer has also been suggested. The aim of 
      this study was to analyze Hh signaling in the mouse mammary gland through the
      generation of transgenic mice that express Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) under the control
      of the mammary-specific WAP promoter (WAP-Shh mice). To identify mammary cells
      capable of activating the Hh pathway we bred WAP-Shh mice to Ptch1-lacZ knock-in 
      mice, in which the expression of a nuclear-targeted beta-galactosidase reporter
      protein (beta-gal) is driven by the endogenous Patched 1 gene regulatory region. 
      After two cycles of induction of transgenic Shh expression, we detected areas of 
      X-gal reactivity. Immunohistochemical analysis showed nuclear beta-gal staining
      in clusters of mammary cells in WAP-Shh/Ptch1-lacZ bitransgenic mice. These were 
      epithelial cells present in a basal location of displastic ducts and alveoli,
      adjacent to Shh-expressing luminal cells, and overexpressed epithelial basal
      markers keratin 5, 14 and 17 and transcription factor p63. Absence of smooth
      muscle actin expression and a cuboidal morphology differentiated Hh-responding
      cells from flat-shaped mature myoepithelial cells. Groups of cells expressing
      stem cell markers integrin beta3 and keratins 6 and 15 were also detected within 
      Hh-responding areas. In addition, we found that Hh-responding cells in the
      mammary glands of WAP-Shh/Ptch1-lacZ mice were ciliated and exhibited a low
      proliferation rate. Our data show the paracrine nature of hedgehog signaling in
      the epithelial compartment of the mouse mammary gland, where a subset of basal
      cells that express mammary progenitor cell markers and exhibit primary cilia is
      expanded in response to secretory epithelium-derived Shh.

AB  - Oxaliplatin and paclitaxel are commonly used anti-cancer drugs, but they
      frequently cause peripheral neuropathic pain. In this study, we investigated the 
      effect of elcatonin, a synthetic eel calcitonin, on oxaliplatin- and
      paclitaxel-induced neuropathy in rats. The rats were treated with a single dose
      of oxaliplatin (6 mg/kg, i.p.) or repeated doses of paclitaxel (2 mg/kg, i.p.) on
      4 alternate days. Both treatments resulted in cold and mechanical allodynia. We
      assessed the anti-allodynic effects of subcutaneously administered elcatonin (20 
      U/kg/day) by using a newly developed method to provide cold stimulation (8
      degrees C) directly to the hind paw of the rats and by using the von Frey test.
      Elcatonin almost completely reversed the effects of both cold and mechanical
      allodynia. To determine the mechanism of this anti-allodynic effect, we examined 
      the effect of elcatonin on neuropathy induced by intraplantar injection of two
      organic compounds: allyl isothiocyanate (1 nmol/paw), which activates transient
      receptor potential ankyrin-1 channels, and menthol (1.28 mumol/paw), which
      activates transient receptor potential ankyrin-1 and melastatin-8.
      Pre-administration of elcatonin almost completely prevented cold and mechanical
      allodynia from being induced by both compounds. These results suggest that
      elcatonin attenuates oxaliplatin- and paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain by
      inhibiting the cellular signaling related to transient receptor potential
      ankyrin-1 and melastatin-8. Thus, we conclude that administration of elcatonin
      may improve the quality of life of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.

AB  - Mutations in an enzyme can result in a neomorphic catalytic activity in cancers. 
      We applied cancer-associated mutations from isocitrate dehydrogenases to
      homologous residues in the active sites of homoisocitrate dehydrogenases to
      derive enzymes that catalyze the conversion of 2-oxoadipate to
      (R)-2-hydroxyadipate, a critical step for adipic acid production. Thus, we
      provide a prototypic example of how insights from cancer genome sequencing and
      functional studies can aid in enzyme redesign.

TI  - Neurotrophin-3 modulates breast cancer cells and the microenvironment to promote 
      the growth of breast cancer brain metastasis.
PG  - 4064-77
LID - 10.1038/onc.2012.417 [doi]
AB  - Metastasis, which remains incompletely characterized at the molecular and
      biochemical levels, is a highly specific process. Despite the ability of
      disseminated cancer cells to intravasate into distant tissues, it has been long
      recognized that only a limited subset of target organs develop clinically overt
      metastases. Therefore, subsequent adaptation of disseminated cancer cells to
      foreign tissue microenvironment determines the metastatic latency and tissue
      tropism of these cells. As a result, studying interactions between the
      disseminated cancer cells and the adjacent stromal cells will provide a better
      understanding of what constitutes a favorable or unfavorable microenvironment for
      disseminated cancer cells in a tissue-specific manner. Previously, we reported a 
      protein signature of brain metastasis showing increased ability of brain
      metastatic breast cancer cells to counteract oxidative stress. In this study, we 
      showed that another protein from the brain metastatic protein signature,
      neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), has a dual function of regulating the metastatic growth of
      metastatic breast cancer cells and reducing the activation of immune response in 
      the brain. More importantly, increased NT-3 secretion in metastatic breast cancer
      cells results in a reversion of mesenchymal-like (EMT) state to epithelial-like
      (MET) state and vice versa. Ectopic expression of NT-3 in EMT-like breast cancer 
      cells reduces their migratory ability and increases the expression of HER2 (human
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and E-cadherin at the cell-cell junction. In 
      addition, both endogenous and ectopic expression of NT-3 reduced the number of
      fully activated cytotoxic microglia. In summary, NT-3 appears to promote growth
      of metastatic breast cancer cells in the brain by facilitating the
      re-epithelialization of metastatic breast cancer cells and downmodulating the
      cytotoxic response of microglia. Most importantly, our results provide new
      insights into the latency and development of central nervous system
      macrometastases in patients with HER2-positive breast tumors and provide
      mechanistic rationale to target HER2 signaling for HER2-positive breast cancer
      brain metastasis.

      targeting Fra-1.
PG  - 4294-303
LID - 10.1038/onc.2012.432 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs have key roles in tumor metastasis. Here, we describe the regulation
      and function of miR-34a and miR-34c (miR-34a/c) in breast cancer metastasis.
      Expression analysis verified that miR-34a/c expression is significantly decreased
      in metastatic breast cancer cells and human primary breast tumors with lymph node
      metastases. Overexpression of miR-34a/c could inhibit breast cancer cell
      migration and invasion in vitro and distal pulmonary metastasis in vivo. Further 
      studies revealed that Fos-related antigen 1 (Fra-1 or Fosl1) is a downstream
      target of miR-34a/c as miR-34a/c bound directly to the 3'untranslated region of
      Fra-1, subsequently reducing both the mRNA and protein levels of Fra-1. Silencing
      of Fra-1 recapitulated the effects of miR-34a/c overexpression, whereas enforced 
      expression of Fra-1 reverses the suppressive effects of miR-34a/c. Moreover,
      significant downregulation of miR-34a in metastatic breast cancer tissues was
      found to be inversely correlated with Fra-1 expression. Our results demonstrate
      that miR-34a/c functions as a metastasis suppressor to regulate breast cancer
      migration and invasion through targeting Fra-1 oncogene and suggest a therapeutic
      application of miR-34 in breast cancer.

PG  - 5546-52
LID - 10.1039/c2an35883b [doi]
AB  - The study of the regulatory roles in small RNAs can be accelerated by techniques 
      that permit simple, low-cost, and rapid extraction of small RNAs from a small
      number of cells. In order to ensure highly specific and sensitive detection, the 
      extracted RNAs should be free of the background nucleic acids and present stably 
      in a small volume. To meet these criteria, we designed a multi-well/multi-channel
      (M&M) chip to carry out automatic and selective isolation of small RNAs via
      solid-phase extraction (SPE), followed by reverse-transcription (RT) to convert
      them to the more stable cDNAs in a final volume of 2 muL. Droplets containing
      buffers for RNA binding, washing, and elution were trapped in microwells, which
      were connected by one channel, and suspended in mineral oil. The silica magnetic 
      particles (SMPs) for SPE were moved along the channel from well to well, i.e. in 
      between droplets, by a fixed magnet and a translation stage, allowing the nucleic
      acid fragments to bind to the SMPs, be washed, and then be eluted for RT reaction
      within 15 minutes. RNAs shorter than 63 nt were selectively enriched from cell
      lysates, with recovery comparable to that of a commercial kit. Physical
      separation of the droplets on our M&M chip allowed the usage of multiple channels
      for parallel processing of multiple samples. It also permitted smooth integration
      with on-chip RT-PCR, which simultaneously detected the target microRNA, mir-191, 
      expressed in fewer than 10 cancer cells. Our results have demonstrated that the
      M&M chip device is a valuable and cost-saving platform for studying small RNA
      expression patterns in a limited number of cells with reasonable sample
      throughput.

TI  - Impact of robotic surgery on sexual and urinary functions after fully robotic
      nerve-sparing total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer.
PG  - 672-8
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0b013e318269d03b [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary and sexual dysfunctions are recognized complications of
      rectal cancer surgery. Their incidence after robotic surgery is as yet unknown.
      The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the impact of robotic surgery
      for rectal cancer on sexual and urinary functions in male and female patients.
      METHODS AND PROCEDURES: From April 2008 to December 2010, 74 patients undergoing 
      fully robotic resection for rectal cancer were prospectively included in the
      study. Urinary and sexual dysfunctions affecting quality of life were assessed
      with specific self-administered questionnaires in all patients undergoing robotic
      total mesorectal excision (RTME). Results were calculated with validated scoring 
      systems and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The analyses of the questionnaires
      completed by the 74 patients who underwent RTME showed that sexual function and
      general sexual satisfaction decreased significantly 1 month after intervention:
      19.1 +/- 8.7 versus 11.9 +/- 10.2 (P < 0.05) for erectile function and 6.9 +/-
      2.4 versus 5.3 +/- 2.5 (P < 0.05) for general satisfaction in men; 2.6 +/- 3.3
      versus 0.8 +/- 1.4 (P < 0.05) and 2.4 +/- 2.5 versus 0.7 +/- 1.6 (P < 0.05) for
      arousal and general satisfaction, respectively, in women. Subsequently, both
      parameters increased progressively, and 1 year after surgery, the values were
      comparable to those measured before surgery. Concerning urinary function, the
      grade of incontinence measured 1 year after the intervention was unchanged for
      both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: RTME allows for preservation of urinary and sexual
      functions. This is probably due to the superior movements of the wristed
      instruments that facilitate fine dissection, coupled with a stable and magnified 
      view that helps in recognizing the inferior hypogastric plexus.

TI  - Esophagectomy using a thoracoscopic approach with an open laparotomic or
      hand-assisted laparoscopic abdominal stage for esophageal cancer: analysis of
      survival and prognostic factors in 315 patients.
PG  - 873-85
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0b013e31826c87cd [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Survival and prognostic factors were analyzed in 315 patients with
      esophageal cancer undergoing thoracoscopic-assisted esophagectomy (TAE). The
      5-year survival rate of 57.8% was satisfactory, indicating the oncological
      feasibility of TAE. Perioperative outcomes affected overall survival in the whole
      cohort but not in the subgroup treated with 2 endoscopic stages. OBJECTIVE: To
      estimate the oncological feasibility of thoracoscopic-assisted esophagectomy
      (TAE) for esophageal cancer and to clarify the prognostic impact of perioperative
      factors after TAE. BACKGROUND: Favorable perioperative outcomes of TAE versus
      open surgery have been demonstrated. However, survival data after TAE in a large 
      cohort are limited, and no information on the prognostic influence of
      perioperative factors after TAE is available. METHODS: Prospectively collected
      data for 315 patients undergoing TAE for esophageal cancer were analyzed.
      Survival was compared with the Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis 
      between 2 surgical approaches: thoracoscopic and hand-assisted laparoscopic
      esophagectomy (THLE) and thoracoscopic and open laparotomic esophagectomy (TOE). 
      Factors affecting overall survival were identified with Cox multivariate
      regression analysis in the whole cohort and the THLE subgroup. RESULTS: THLE and 
      TOE were performed in 153 and 162 patients, respectively. The overall 5-year
      survival of the whole cohort was 57.8%, with no difference between the THLE and
      the TOE group. Multivariate analysis of the 315 patients identified the following
      prognostic factors: blood loss, blood transfusion, intensive care unit stay,
      cardiovascular complications, pathological T and N stages, lymphatic invasion,
      intramural metastasis, and number of metastatic nodes. In the THLE subgroup,
      cerebral comorbidity, histological subtype, pathological T stage, and number of
      metastatic nodes were independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: TAE was
      oncologically feasible. Perioperative factors affected survival in the whole
      cohort, but did not in the THLE subgroup. However, the reduced perioperative
      factor effect in this subgroup would be small because the survival rates of the 2
      surgical approaches were equal.

TI  - Efficacy of prophylactic antibiotic administration for breast cancer surgery in
      overweight or obese patients: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 37-43
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0b013e31826d832d [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of prophylactic antibiotics on the prevention of 
      surgical site infection (SSI) and the cost-effectiveness of this prophylaxis for 
      breast cancer surgery in overweight or obese women. BACKGROUND DATA: SSI is
      higher than expected after breast surgery. Obesity was found to be one of the
      risk factors. METHODS: The trial was designed as a phase IV randomized,
      controlled, parallel-group efficacy trial. It was conducted at a tertiary
      university hospital. Overweight or obese women with clinically early-stage breast
      cancer who had been assigned to undergo surgery were eligible. Patients were
      randomly allocated to either a prophylaxis or a control group by using a
      computer-generated list. The prophylaxis group received 1 g ampicillin-sulbactam 
      intravenously at anesthesia. The control group received no intervention. Patients
      and observers were blinded to the assignments. The primary outcome was the
      comparison of SSI incidences of the 2 groups. Patients were monitored for 30
      days. RESULTS: A total of 369 patients were included in final analysis, out of
      which 187 were allocated for prophylaxis and 182 were randomly assigned to the
      control group. Analysis was done according to the intention-to-treat principle.
      Prophylaxis significantly reduced the SSI rate (4.8%) in the prophylaxis group
      when compared with that in the control group [13.7%; relative risk (RR) 0.35; 95%
      CI: 0.17-0.73]. No adverse reaction was observed. The mean SSI-related cost
      (20.26 USD) was found to be significantly higher in the control group when
      compared with that (8.48 USD) in the prophylaxis group. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic
      prophylaxis significantly decreased SSI incidence after elective surgery and was 
      shown to be cost-effective in obese breast cancer patients. ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Prognostic factors after pulmonary metastasectomy for colorectal cancer and
      rationale for determining surgical indications: a retrospective analysis.
PG  - 1059-64
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0b013e31826eda3b [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify prognostic factors after pulmonary metastasectomy
      for colorectal cancer and propose the clinical application of them. Furthermore, 
      we endeavored to provide a rationale for pulmonary metastasesectomy. BACKGROUND: 
      Several prognostic factors have been proposed, but clinical application of them
      remains unclear. Moreover, there is no theoretical evidence that pulmonary
      metastasectomy is indicated for colorectal cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively
      analyzed 1030 patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy for colorectal
      cancer from 1990 to 2008. Prognostic factors were identified and the relationship
      of recurrent sites after pulmonary resection to pulmonary tumor size was
      assessed. RESULTS: Overall 5-year survival was 53.5%. Median survival time was
      69.5 months. Univariate analysis showed tumor number (P < 0.0001), tumor size (P 
      < 0.0001), prethoracotomy serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level (P <
      0.0001), lymph node involvement (P < 0.0001), and completeness of resection (P < 
      0.0001) to significantly influence survival. In multivariate analysis, all
      remained independent predictors of outcome. In patients whose recurrent sites
      extended downstream from the lung via hematogenous colorectal cancer spread,
      pulmonary tumor size was significantly larger than in those with recurrent sites 
      confined to the lung and regions upstream from the lung. CONCLUSIONS: We should
      utilize these prognostic factors to detect patients who might benefit from
      surgery. Therefore, we should periodically follow up advanced colorectal cancer
      patients by chest computed tomography to detect small pulmonary metastases before
      serum CEA elevation. Metastases to the lung or organs upstream from the lung are 
      regarded as semi-local for colorectal cancer. This concept provides a rationale
      for validating surgical indications for pulmonary metastases from colorectal
      cancer.

      and alter gene expression.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of SNPs that are
      associated with human traits and diseases. But, because the vast majority of
      these SNPs are located in non-coding regions of the genome, the mechanisms by
      which they promote disease risk have remained elusive. Employing a new
      methodology that combines cistromics, epigenomics and genotype imputation, we
      annotate the non-coding regions of the genome in breast cancer cells and
      systematically identify the functional nature of SNPs associated with breast
      cancer risk. Our results show that breast cancer risk-associated SNPs are
      enriched in the cistromes of FOXA1 and ESR1 and the epigenome of histone H3
      lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) in a cancer- and cell type-specific manner.
      Furthermore, the majority of the risk-associated SNPs modulate the affinity of
      chromatin for FOXA1 at distal regulatory elements, thereby resulting in
      allele-specific gene expression, which is exemplified by the effect of the
      rs4784227 SNP on the TOX3 gene within the 16q12.1 risk locus.

TI  - Aberrant activation of hedgehog pathway in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
PG  - 315-22
LID - 10.1007/s10238-012-0198-1 [doi]
AB  - Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a very common head and neck cancer in southern 
      china. Despite advances in surgical and chemotherapeutic approaches, its
      prognosis is still not promising. Hedgehog signaling pathway was reported to be
      involved in a number of cancers including head and neck. However, it remains
      unclear regarding the role of this pathway in NPC. By real-time PCR, we found
      Ptch1, Smo, and Gli-1 were expressed in all human nasopharyngeal epithelial
      tissues and cell lines. Compared with nasopharyngeal normal epithelial tissues,
      the mRNA expression level of Gli-1 was higher in carcinoma and nasopharyngitis
      (NPI) epithelial tissues. While compared with nasopharyngitis epithelia, the mRNA
      expression level of Ptch1 was lower in carcinoma epithelia and normal epithelia. 
      The expressions of Smo mRNA were not significantly different among these
      epithelial tissues. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that the expression
      level of Gli-1 was higher in NPC than NPI. Thus, our data indicated that aberrant
      activation of hedgehog pathway in NPC. Furthermore, blocking the pathway with
      cyclopamine inhibited the proliferation of NPC epithelia cell lines. In addition,
      blockade of the pathway in three NPC cell lines with cyclopamine-induced tumor
      cell apoptosis. The transcription of hedgehog target genes also is inhibited by
      cyclopamine. These data suggested that hedgehog pathway may sustain
      nasopharyngeal tumor growth. Our data demonstrated that hedgehog signaling
      pathway was involved in NPC pathogenesis and might be a novel therapeutic target 
      for NPC.

TI  - Recombinant human leptin induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in human gastric
      cancer MGC-803 cells.
PG  - 305-14
LID - 10.1007/s10238-012-0211-8 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of recombinant human leptin
      (rhLep) on the proliferation of human gastric cancer MGC-803 cells and its
      underlying mechanisms. RT-PCR was performed to identify the expression of leptin 
      receptor (Ob-R). Cell proliferation was measured with MTT assay. DNA content and 
      cell cycle were analyzed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was assessed by DNA ladder 
      assay and flow cytometry analysis using Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining.
      Underlying mechanisms of rhLep-induced apoptosis were evaluated by the activities
      of caspase-3, -8, -9, and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Moreover, the
      phosphorylation of STAT3 in MGC-803 cells upon rhLep administration was detected 
      by Western blot analysis. Our results demonstrated that two leptin receptors
      (Ob-Ra and Ob-Rb) were expressed in MGC-803 cells. rhLep diminished the
      proliferation rate of MGC-803 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner
      and induced MGC-803 cell apoptosis involving in the activation of caspase-8 and
      caspase-3 but not caspase-9. In addition, rhLep failed to induce cytochrome c
      release from mitochondria and had no effect on the activation of STAT3 in MGC-803
      cells. Therefore, from these results, we concluded that rhLep significantly
      inhibited cell proliferation via G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest and induced
      apoptosis through the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in human gastric cancer MGC-803
      cells.

TI  - Prediction of tumor stage and lymph node involvement with dynamic
      contrast-enhanced MRI after chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer.
PG  - 573-80
LID - 10.1007/s00384-012-1576-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The usefulness of restaging by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after
      chemoradiotherapy (CTx/RTx) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer has
      not yet been established, mostly due to the difficult differentiation between
      viable tumor and fibrosis. MRI with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences may
      be of additional value in distinguishing malignant from nonmalignant tissue. The 
      aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of tumor, nodal staging, and
      circumferential resection margin (CRM) involvement by MRI with DCE sequences
      after CTx/RTx. METHODS: The accuracies were assessed by MRI on T2-weighted
      magnetic resonance (MR) images with DCE sequences in patients with locally
      advanced rectal cancer after a long course of CTx/RTx. MR images were assessed by
      two independent radiologists. RESULTS: For tumor staging and CRM involvement, MRI
      with DCE sequences had an accuracy of 45 and 60 %, respectively. The accuracy for
      nodal staging was 93 %. On MRI, malignant lymph nodes had a median diameter of 8 
      mm (range, 4-18) and benign lymph nodes a median diameter of 4 mm (range, 3-11). 
      A significant indicator for benign nodes was hypointensity on T2-weighted images 
      (p < 0.001) and early complete arterial phase enhancement on DCE-weighted images 
      (p < 0.001). A significant indicator for malignant nodes was heterogeneity on
      T2-weighted images (chi (2), p < 0.000) and early incomplete arterial phase
      enhancement on DCE (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: MRI with DCE is a useful tool for
      nodal staging after CTx/RTx. The addition of DCE sequences did not improve the
      accuracy of determining the tumor stage, CRM involvement, and in detecting
      complete response.

TI  - Systematic review of laser and other light therapy for the management of oral
      mucositis in cancer patients.
PG  - 333-41
LID - 10.1007/s00520-012-1605-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to review the available literature and
      define clinical practice guidelines for the use of laser and other light
      therapies for the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis. METHODS: A
      systematic review was conducted by the Mucositis Study Group of the Multinational
      Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society of Oral Oncology. 
      The body of evidence for each intervention, in each cancer treatment setting, was
      assigned an evidence level. Based on the evidence level, one of the following
      three guideline determinations was possible: recommendation, suggestion, and no
      guideline possible. RESULTS: A new recommendation was made for low-level laser
      (wavelength at 650 nm, power of 40 mW, and each square centimeter treated with
      the required time to a tissue energy dose of 2 J/cm(2) (2 s/point)) for the
      prevention of oral mucositis in adult patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell 
      transplantation conditioned with high-dose chemotherapy, with or without total
      body irradiation. A new suggestion was made for low-level laser (wavelength
      around 632.8 nm) for the prevention of oral mucositis in patients undergoing
      radiotherapy, without concomitant chemotherapy, for head and neck cancer. No
      guideline was possible in other populations and for other light sources due to
      insufficient evidence. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing evidence in favor of low-level
      laser therapy allowed for the development of two new guidelines supporting this
      modality in the populations listed above. Evidence for other populations was also
      generally encouraging over a range of wavelengths and intensities. However,
      additional well-designed research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of laser and
      other light therapies in various cancer treatment settings.

AB  - A noninvasive technology that quantitatively measures the activity of oncogenic
      signaling pathways could have a broad impact on cancer diagnosis and treatment
      with targeted therapies. Here we describe the development of
      (89)Zr-desferrioxamine-labeled transferrin ((89)Zr-transferrin), a new positron
      emission tomography (PET) radiotracer that binds the transferrin receptor 1
      (TFRC, CD71) with high avidity. The use of (89)Zr-transferrin produces
      high-contrast PET images that quantitatively reflect treatment-induced changes in
      MYC-regulated TFRC expression in a MYC-driven prostate cancer xenograft model.
      Moreover, (89)Zr-transferrin imaging can detect the in situ development of
      prostate cancer in a transgenic MYC prostate cancer model, as well as in
      prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) before histological or anatomic
      evidence of invasive cancer. These preclinical data establish (89)Zr-transferrin 
      as a sensitive tool for noninvasive measurement of oncogene-driven TFRC
      expression in prostate and potentially other cancers, with prospective near-term 
      clinical application.

TI  - LIFR is a breast cancer metastasis suppressor upstream of the Hippo-YAP pathway
      and a prognostic marker.
PG  - 1511-7
LID - 10.1038/nm.2940 [doi]
AB  - There is a pressing need to identify prognostic markers of metastatic disease and
      targets for treatment. Combining high-throughput RNA sequencing, functional
      characterization, mechanistic studies and clinical validation, we identify
      leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) as a breast cancer metastasis
      suppressor downstream of the microRNA miR-9 and upstream of Hippo signaling.
      Restoring LIFR expression in highly malignant tumor cells suppresses metastasis
      by triggering a Hippo kinase cascade that leads to phosphorylation, cytoplasmic
      retention and functional inactivation of the transcriptional coactivator
      YES-associated protein (YAP). Conversely, loss of LIFR in nonmetastatic breast
      cancer cells induces migration, invasion and metastatic colonization through
      activation of YAP. LIFR is downregulated in human breast carcinomas and inversely
      correlates with metastasis. Notably, in approximately 1,000 nonmetastatic breast 
      tumors, LIFR expression status correlated with metastasis-free, recurrence-free
      and overall survival outcomes in the patients. These findings identify LIFR as a 
      metastasis suppressor that functions through the Hippo-YAP pathway and has
      significant prognostic power.

TI  - [The role of TGF-beta-related signal transduction pathways in pathogenesis of
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition as a key element in cancer development and
      progression].
PG  - 583-91
AB  - Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biological process that drives
      polarized, immotile epithelial cells to undergo multiple biochemical changes to
      acquire a mesenchymal cell phenotype. The characteristic features of EMT are cell
      apolarity, loss of cellular adhesion, reduced expression of E-cadherin and
      increased migratory capacity, as well as invasiveness. EMT is a physiological
      process that is essential for normal embryonic development. Additionally,
      abnormal activation of EMT contributes to some human pathologies such as tissue
      fibrosis, cancer cell invasion and metastasis. In both situations, the basic
      molecular mechanisms are similar, but lead to different effects depending on cell
      type and biological conditions of the environment. TGF-beta is a multifunctional 
      cytokine that controls proliferation, differentiation and other functions in many
      cell types. It has been found that neoplastic development converts TGF-beta into 
      an oncogenic cytokine. It activates various molecular processes, which are
      engaged in EMT initiation. All that makes TGF-beta a key regulator of EMT.

TI  - [Cancer stem cells].
PG  - 629-36
AB  - Cancer stem cell theory gains increasingly greater significance in the world of
      medicine. Numerous findings of scientific research in vivo and in vitro indicate 
      that it is the population of undifferentiated, self-renewing cells which is
      responsible for recurrence of cancer and metastasis. Similarly to normal stem
      cells, cancer stem cells (CSC) function in the environment of the other cells of 
      the organism, called the niche, where they receive signals for differentiation
      and proliferation processes. Disorders in the signaling pathways between CSC and 
      the niche that result from e.g. acquired oncogenic mutations may lead to
      uncontrolled proliferation of stem cells, gaining independence from the primary
      niche or settling a new microenvironment. CSC are identified on the basis of
      specific markers - membrane proteins or cell enzymes. Methods based on the
      measurement of dye fluorescence (obtaining side population, SP) or fluorescence
      of the fluorophore conjugated with a monoclonal antibody directed against the
      specific CSC marker are used for isolation. A different method obtains
      morphologically miscellaneous clones by single cell cloning: holo-, mero- and
      paraclones. Tumor forming assay in NOD/SCID mice is a standard in vivo test that 
      confirms the stem character of isolated cells. However, this model may not fully 
      reflect the complexity of cancer illnesses in human beings. Solving the mystery
      of oncogenesis, including the existence of cancer stem cells, is undoubtedly one 
      of the priorities of contemporary medicine that should contribute to the
      improvement of cancer therapy.

TI  - [The immunomodulatory role of plant polyphenols].
PG  - 637-46
AB  - Polyphenols, plant secondary metabolites, are present in human diet and have been
      widely used for medical and cosmetic purposes. They possess beneficial features
      such as antioxidant, immunomodulatory, anti-cancer and antibacterial activity.
      There is some evidence that these phytochemicals can improve wound healing.
      However, more and more data suggest that, under certain conditions, they can act 
      in a different, often unpredictable way. Some investigations indicate that
      polyphenols, generally known as antioxidants, can exhibit pro-oxidant, and
      therefore cytotoxic, activity. Hence, the ability of phytochemicals to induce
      apoptosis of cancer cells and bacterial cell damage may be, at least partly, due 
      to their prooxidant properties. Phytocompounds enter the body through the
      digestive system where they undergo metabolic processes that often change their
      chemical features. The gastrointestinal microbiome interacts with phytochemicals 
      and influences their bioavailability and absorption in the gut. Except for
      biochemical changes of plant polyphenols in the host, the achievement of
      therapeutic concentration in vivo may be the main problem in the determination of
      their real efficacy. Ambiguous results of some studies demonstrate the need for
      the development of more accurate and standardized methods for the evaluation of
      polyphenols' properties. Better understanding of human body-polyphenol
      interactions is crucial for more effective use of these phytochemicals in disease
      prevention and therapy.

TI  - Iron in relation to gastric cancer in the Alpha-tocopherol, Beta-carotene Cancer 
      Prevention Study.
PG  - 2033-42
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-0799 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron is an essential micronutrient that can have carcinogenic effects
      when at high or low concentrations. Previous studies of iron in relation to
      gastric cancer have not assessed subtype-specific relationships. We used the
      prospective Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene (ATBC) Cancer Prevention Study to
      assess whether iron metrics were associated with gastric cardia cancer (GCC) and 
      gastric noncardia cancer (GNCC). METHODS: We selected 341 incident gastric cancer
      cases (86 cardia, 172 noncardia, and 83 nonspecified), accrued during 22 years of
      follow-up, and 341 individually matched controls. We measured prediagnostic serum
      iron, ferritin, unsaturated iron binding capacity, and C-reactive protein. Total 
      iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and transferrin saturation were estimated from these
      metrics. Dietary iron exposures were estimated from a food frequency
      questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression was used for analysis. RESULTS: 
      Serum iron metrics were not associated with GCC, except for a potential
      "n"-shaped relationship with TIBC (global P = 0.038). GNCC was inversely
      associated with serum ferritin (global P = 0.024), serum iron (global P = 0.060) 
      and, possibly, transferrin saturation. TIBC appeared to share a "u"-shaped
      relationship with GNCC (global P = 0.033). Dietary iron exposures were not
      associated with either subsite. Adjustment for Helicobacter pylori and gastric
      atrophy had little effect on observed associations. CONCLUSIONS: We found little 
      evidence for the involvement of iron exposure in the pathogenesis of GCC. GNCC
      was associated with an iron profile similar to that of iron deficiency. IMPACT:
      Our findings indicate that inverse associations between iron metrics and gastric 
      cancer are driven by associations with GNCC. Further elucidation of potential
      mechanisms is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Systematic genome-wide reductions of methylated cytosine (5-mC)
      levels have been observed in colorectal cancer tissue and are suspected to play a
      role in carcinogenesis, possibly as a consequence of inadequate folate intake.
      Reduced 5-mC levels in peripheral blood leukocytes have been associated with
      increased risk of colorectal cancer and adenoma in cross-sectional studies.
      METHODS: To minimize disease- and/or treatment-related effects, we studied
      leukocyte 5-mC levels in prospectively collected blood specimens of 370 cases and
      493 controls who were cancer-free at blood collection from the Prostate, Lung,
      Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Leukocyte 5-mC level was
      determined by a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)/tandem mass
      spectrometry method and expressed as the relative amount of methyl to total
      cytosine residues, or %5-mC. We estimated the association between colorectal
      cancer risk and %5-mC categories by computing ORs and 95% confidence intervals
      (CI) through logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: We observed no dose-dependent
      association between colorectal cancer and%5-mC categories (lowest vs. highest
      tertile: OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.80-1.63; P(trend) = 0.51). However, among subjects
      whose 5-mC levels were at the highest tertile, we observed an inverse association
      between natural folate intake and colorectal cancer (highest tertile of natural
      folate vs. lowest: OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17-0.71; P(trend) = 0.003; P(interaction) 
      = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective investigation show no clear association
      between leukocyte 5-mC level and subsequent colorectal cancer risk but a
      suggestive risk modification between 5-mC level and natural folate intake.
      IMPACT: Adequate folate status may protect against colorectal carcinogenesis
      through mechanisms involving adequate DNA methylation in the genome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Considerable evidence suggests that cigarette smoking is associated
      with a higher risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). What is unclear, however, is the
      impact of quitting smoking on risk attenuation and whether other risk factors for
      CRC modify this association. METHODS: We conducted a pooled analysis of eight
      studies, including 6,796 CRC cases and 7,770 controls, to evaluate the
      association between cigarette smoking history and CRC risk and to investigate
      potential effect modification by other risk factors. RESULTS: Current smokers
      [OR, 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11-1.43] and former smokers (OR, 1.18;
      95% CI, 1.09-1.27), relative to never smokers, showed higher risks of CRC. Former
      smokers remained at higher CRC risk, relative to never smokers, for up to about
      25 years after quitting. The impact of time since quitting varied by cancer
      subsite: The excess risk due to smoking decreased immediately after quitting for 
      proximal colon and rectal cancer but not until about 20 years post-quitting for
      distal colon cancer. Furthermore, we observed borderline statistically
      significant additive interactions between smoking status and body mass index
      [BMI; relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI]), 0.15; 95% CI, -0.01 to
      0.31; P = 0.06] and significant additive interaction between smoking status and
      fruit consumption (RERI, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.01-0.30; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: CRC risk
      remained increased for about 25 years after quitting smoking, and the pattern of 
      decline in risk varied by cancer subsite. BMI and fruit intake modified the risk 
      associated with smoking. IMPACT: These results contribute to a better
      understanding of the mechanisms through which smoking impacts CRC etiology.

TI  - Contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasonography in digestive diseases.
PG  - 1063-72
LID - 10.1007/s00535-012-0662-4 [doi]
AB  - Contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasonography (CE-EUS) was introduced in the early
      1990s. The concept of the injection of carbon dioxide microbubbles into the
      hepatic artery as a contrast material (enhanced ultrasonography) led to
      "endoscopic ultrasonographic angiography". After the arrival of the
      first-generation contrast agent, high-frequency (12 MHz) EUS brought about the
      enhancement of EUS images in the diagnosis of pancreatico-biliary diseases, upper
      gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, and submucosal tumors. The electronic scanning
      endosonoscope with both radial and linear probes enabled the use of high-end
      ultrasound machines and depicted the enhancement of both color/power Doppler
      flow-based imaging and harmonic-based imaging using second-generation contrast
      agents. Many reports have described the usefulness of the differential diagnosis 
      of pancreatic diseases and other abdominal lesions. Quantitative evaluation of
      CE-EUS images was an objective method of diagnosis using the time-intensity curve
      (TIC), but it was limited to the region of interest. Recently developed Inflow
      Time Mapping can be generated from stored clips and used to display the pattern
      of signal enhancement with time after injection, offering temporal difference of 
      contrast agents and improved tumor characterization. On the other hand,
      three-dimensional CE-EUS images added new information to the literature, but
      lacked positional information. Three-dimensional CE-EUS with accurate positional 
      information is awaited. To date, most reports have been related to pancreatic
      lesions or lymph nodes. Hemodynamic analysis might be of use for diseases in
      other organs: upper GI cancer diagnosis, submucosal tumors, and biliary
      disorders, and it might also provide functional information. Studies of CE-EUS in
      diseases in many other organs will increase in the near future.

TI  - (18)F-FDG uptake at initial staging of the adrenocortical cancers: a diagnostic
      tool but not of prognostic value.
PG  - 107-12
LID - 10.1007/s00268-012-1802-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare cancer for which little
      level evidence exists to guide management. (18)F-FDG PET
      ((18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) is an increasingly used
      diagnostic tool in patients with suspicious or indeterminate adrenal tumors. In
      some other solid tumors, (18)F-FDG PET may offer prognostic information that can 
      guide optimal patient treatment. The aim of the present study was to evaluate
      whether preoperative (18)F-FDG PET based on SUVs assessments has a prognostic
      value in ACC patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in
      patients who underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT for the evaluation of ACC. Inclusion
      criteria were an unequivocal diagnosis of ACC; all data from primary diagnosis
      available; (18)F-FDG PET/CT performed prior to surgery or other treatment of the 
      primary tumor; a minimum of 6-months follow-up for surviving patients. All
      (18)F-FDG PET/CT procedures were reinterpreted in a blind fashion. RESULTS:
      Thirty-seven patients (23 without metastasis [M0], 14 with metastasis [M1])
      fulfilled the study criteria. Median uptake values were tumor standardized uptake
      values (SUV)(max) = 11 (range: 3-56) and a tumor/liver SUV(max) ratio = 4.2
      (range: 1.3-15). Median follow-up was 20 months. Although classic risk factors
      (tumoral stage, Weiss score) were associated with poor outcome, there was no
      correlation between primary tumor FDG uptake with overall survival (OS) and
      disease free survival (DFS) in M0 patients and with overall survival in M1
      patients. (18)F-FDG uptake correlated inconsistently with sinister histological
      features, such as atypical mitoses or necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: At initial staging, 
      primary tumor FDG uptake in ACC patients does not correlate with OS and DFS at 2 
      years. Patient prognosis and treatment strategy should not be based on uptake
      values.

TI  - Overexpression of p53 protein in human tumors.
PG  - 115-23
AB  - According to the current concept of carcinogenesis, neoplastic transformation
      consists of multistep accumulations of adverse genetic and epigenetic events. p53
      is a transcription factor that regulates cellular response to diverse forms of
      stress through a complex network which monitors genome integrity and cell
      homeostasis. Mutant p53 loss-of-function, dominant-negative, and gain-of-function
      properties have been implicated in the development of a wide variety of human
      cancers, and it is generally accepted that p53 is a component in biochemical
      pathways central to human carcinogenesis. Study of p53 has come to the forefront 
      of cancer research, and detection of its abnormalities during the development of 
      tumors may have diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications. In this
      review, we focus on recent research on overexpression of mutant p53 in human
      cancer, with an emphasis on mutant p53 regulation, gain of function of mutant p53
      in transcriptional effects, and the diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive value 
      of p53 overexpression in human cancer.

TI  - Invasion of the inner and outer layers of the visceral pleura in pT1 size lung
      adenocarcinoma measuring </= 3 cm: correlation with malignant aggressiveness and 
      prognosis.
PG  - 513-9
LID - 10.1007/s00428-012-1317-9 [doi]
AB  - Visceral pleural invasion (VPI) is defined as penetration by cancer cells of the 
      elastic layer of the pleura. The purpose of this retrospective study was to
      compare the effect of invasion of the inner elastic layer of the pleura on
      survival to that of invasion of the outer elastic layer. One hundred twenty-four 
      pT1 size lung adenocarcinomas were examined for visceral pleural invasion, which 
      was classified into three types: no pleural invasion (NPI), invasion of the inner
      elastic layer only (IEL), and invasion of both inner and outer elastic layers
      (OEL). The relationship between the types of VPI and the prognosis was analyzed
      by univariate and multivariate analyses. Seventy-three (59 %) cancers showed NPI,
      while 51 cancers showed invasion of the pleura [(IEL) in 26 (21 %), OEL in 25 (20
      %)]. The 5-year survival was 81, 60, and 37 % for patients with NPI, IEL, and
      OEL, respectively. Survival was poorest in patients with OEL (P < 0.01). Invasion
      of the outer elastic layer was also significantly associated with lymph node
      metastasis and frequent lymphatic involvement, micropapillary pattern, higher
      stromal invasion grade, and presence of small cluster invasion within tumors.
      Univariate analysis showed a significant relationship between invasion of the
      outer elastic layer and poor prognosis. However, multivariate analysis identified
      lymph node metastasis as the most significant predictor of poor prognosis.
      Analysis of invasion of the inner and outer visceral pleura is important;
      invasion of the outer elastic layer correlates with poor prognosis in pT1 size
      lung adenocarcinomas.

AB  - Contrary to conventional wisdom, functional mitochondria are essential for the
      cancer cell. Although mutations in mitochondrial genes are common in cancer
      cells, they do not inactivate mitochondrial energy metabolism but rather alter
      the mitochondrial bioenergetic and biosynthetic state. These states communicate
      with the nucleus through mitochondrial 'retrograde signalling' to modulate signal
      transduction pathways, transcriptional circuits and chromatin structure to meet
      the perceived mitochondrial and nuclear requirements of the cancer cell. Cancer
      cells then reprogramme adjacent stromal cells to optimize the cancer cell
      environment. These alterations activate out-of-context programmes that are
      important in development, stress response, wound healing and nutritional status.

AB  - We investigate the variance in patterns of failure after Gamma Knife radiosurgery
      (GKRS) for patients with brain metastases based on the subtype of the primary
      breast cancer. Between 2000 and 2010, 154 breast cancer patients were treated
      with GKRS for brain metastases. Tumor subtypes were approximated based on hormone
      receptor (HR) and HER2 status of the primary cancer: Luminal A/B (HR+/HER2(-));
      HER2 (HER2+/HR(-)); Luminal HER2 (HR+/HER2+), Basal (HR(-)/HER2(-)), and then
      based on HER2 status alone. The median follow-up period was 54 months.
      Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival times. Multivariable analysis
      was performed using Cox regression models. Median number of lesions treated was
      two (range 1-15) with a median dose of 20 Gy (range 9-24 Gy). Median overall
      survival (OS) was 7, 9, 11 and 22 months for Basal, Luminal A/B, HER2, and
      Luminal HER2, respectively (p = 0.001), and was 17 and 8 months for HER2+ and
      HER(-) patients, respectively (p < 0.001). Breast cancer subtype did not predict 
      time to local failure (p = 0.554), but did predict distant brain failure rate
      (76, 47, 47, 36 % at 1 year for Basal, Luminal A/B, HER2, and Luminal HER2
      respectively, p < 0.001). An increased proportion of HER2+ patients experienced
      neurologic death (46 vs 31 %, p = 0.066). Multivariate analysis revealed that
      HER2+ patients (p = 0.007) independently predicted for improved survival. Women
      with basal subtype have high rates of distant brain failure and worsened
      survival. Our data suggest that differences in biologic behavior of brain
      metastasis occur across breast cancer subtypes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the strength of the correlation
      between colposcopic impression according to Reid colposcopic index (RCI) done by 
      Gynecology residents and biopsy histology in a university hospital. METHODS:
      Colposcopy was performed on 260 women. According to RCI, the scores zero, one, or
      two were given to each of four standardized colposcopy patterns (acid staining,
      iodide staining, margin of lesion, and vascular pattern) and the total score was 
      calculated. In those with multiple lesions, the patterns with the highest score
      were considered. Then the biopsy was obtained from the lesion and put in formalin
      for pathological evaluation. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant
      association between colposcopy findings and histopathology findings and the score
      was increased as parallel as malignancy grade (r = 0.680, P < 0.05). The highest 
      sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of each CIN also were related to
      staining with acetic acid. For high-grade CIN lesions, the highest specificity
      was related to staining with acetic acid, but the sensitivity was equal for four 
      findings. CONCLUSION: Colposcopy using RCI yields a good correlation with
      histology results. It also showed that colposcopy done by Gynecology residents
      using RCI is a feasible and acceptable cervical cancer screening method in a
      university hospital.

TI  - Expression of ADAMTS1 and its correlation with angiogenesis in primary gastric
      cancer and lymph node metastasis.
PG  - 405-13
LID - 10.1007/s10620-012-2379-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A disintegrin and metallopeptidase with thrombospondin motif type 1
      (ADAMTS1) is a recently discovered metalloproteinase with antiangiogenic
      activity. The function of ADAMTS1 in gastric cancer remains unknown. Therefore,
      we were interested in examining ADAMTS1 expression in human gastric cancer, as
      well as its possible correlation with angiogenesis. METHODS: The mRNA and protein
      expression of ADAMTS1, thrombospondin type I (TSP1), and vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) was evaluated by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry,
      respectively, in 56 paired tumor and normal tissue samples, and corresponding
      metastatic lymph nodes (n = 42). Microvessel density (MVD) was also evaluated by 
      immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: ADAMTS1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly
      lower in primary tumors than in corresponding normal tissues, and were
      significantly higher in metastatic lymph nodes compared to their matched primary 
      tumors. High ADAMTS1 mRNA and protein expression was found to be significantly
      associated with lymph node metastasis in primary tumors. There was a negative
      correlation between ADAMTS1 and VEGF mRNA and protein expression in primary
      gastric tumors and normal tissues. A negative correlation was also found between 
      ADAMTS1 protein expression and MVD in primary gastric tumors. In contrast, no
      correlation was detected between ADAMTS1 and TSP1 mRNA and protein expression in 
      primary gastric tumors, normal tissues, and metastatic lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings suggest that ADAMTS1 expression is altered in primary gastric
      cancer and paired lymph node metastasis. In addition, ADAMTS1 has angioinhibitory
      effects in primary gastric cancer due to its low expression and negative
      correlation with VEGF and MVD. However, it appears to lose its anti-angiogenic
      activity in metastatic lymph nodes in gastric cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Sporadic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a highly
      lethal cancer. No proven screening strategies are available and frequent
      cross-sectional imaging studies (CT/MRI) are impractical even in patients thought
      to be at higher risk than the general population. Few PDA biomarkers have been
      studied prospectively for screening. Here, we prospectively evaluated the Adnab-9
      monoclonal antibody in stool, pancreaticobiliary secretions, and tissue for
      screening and prognostic value in sporadic PDA. We also evaluated the prognostic 
      value of characterized early biomarkers in pancreaticobiliary secretions.
      METHODS: Adnab-9 diagnostic ability was tested in stool in 249 and 1,132 patients
      from China and the US, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 22
      tissue samples with Adnab-9 antibody and anti-Defensin 5, a constituent of Paneth
      cells. Pancreatobiliary secretions were collected from 12 PDA patients and 9
      controls. The enriched PCR method was performed to detect K-ras mutations. ELISA 
      was performed with Adnab-9, anti-Her-2/neu, and monoclonal antibody D4 (anti-Reg 
      I). RESULTS: Adnab-9 alone was diagnostic and prognostic when measured in
      pancreatic secretions, feces, and tissues of PDA patients compared to controls (p
      < 0.05). Significantly, Adnab-9 fecal binding can precede the clinical diagnosis 
      by 2.3 years, potentially allowing earlier clinical intervention. In pancreatic
      secretions, a combination of K-ras and Her-2/neu when appropriately standardized 
      can be diagnostic in 75 % of PDA. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that Adnab-9
      may be an effective marker for diagnosis and prognosis of PDA. Adnab-9 may be
      reflective of the presence of Paneth cells confirmed by Defensin-5 staining.
      These cells may modulate the biological activity of the cancer and confer a
      better prognosis.

TI  - miR-17-5p inhibitor enhances chemosensitivity to gemcitabine via upregulating Bim
      expression in pancreatic cancer cells.
PG  - 3160-7
LID - 10.1007/s10620-012-2400-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: miR-17-5p is reported to be overexpressed in pancreatic cancer, and
      it plays an important role in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Gemcitabine 
      is the standard first-line chemotherapeutic agent for pancreatic cancer, however 
      the chemoresistance limits the curative effect. AIMS: In the present study, we
      investigated whether inhibition of miR-17-5p could enhance chemosensitivity to
      gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells. METHODS: miR-17-5p inhibitor was
      transfected to pancreatic cancer cell lines Panc-1 and BxPC3, and then cell
      proliferation, cell apoptosis, caspase-3 activation, and chemosensitivity to
      gemcitabine were measured in vitro. RESULTS: Our data showed that Panc-1 and
      BxPC3 cells transfected with miR-17-5p inhibitor showed growth inhibition,
      spontaneous apoptosis, higher caspase-3 activation, and increased
      chemosensitivity to gemcitabine. In addition, miR-17-5p inhibitor upregulated Bim
      protein expression in a dose-dependent manner without changing the Bim mRNA
      level, and it increased the activity of a luciferase reporter construct
      containing the Bim-3' untranslated region. CONCLUSIONS: These results prove that 
      miR-17-5p negatively regulates Bim at the posttranscriptional level. We suggest
      that miR-17-5p inhibitor gene therapy would be a novel approach to
      chemosensitization for human pancreatic cancer.

TI  - Interfractional trend analysis of dose differences based on 2D transit portal
      dosimetry.
PG  - 6445-58
LID - 10.1088/0031-9155/57/20/6445 [doi]
AB  - Dose delivery of a radiotherapy treatment can be influenced by a number of
      factors. It has been demonstrated that the electronic portal imaging device
      (EPID) is valuable for transit portal dosimetry verification. Patient related
      dose differences can emerge at any time during treatment and can be categorized
      in two types: (1) systematic-appearing repeatedly, (2) random-appearing
      sporadically during treatment. The aim of this study is to investigate how
      systematic and random information appears in 2D transit dose distributions
      measured in the EPID plane over the entire course of a treatment and how this
      information can be used to examine interfractional trends, building toward a
      methodology to support adaptive radiotherapy. To create a trend overview of the
      interfractional changes in transit dose, the predicted portal dose for the
      different beams is compared to a measured portal dose using a gamma evaluation.
      For each beam of the delivered fraction, information is extracted from the gamma 
      images to differentiate systematic from random dose delivery errors. From the
      systematic differences of a fraction for a projected anatomical structures,
      several metrics are extracted like percentage pixels with |gamma| > 1. We
      demonstrate for four example cases the trends and dose difference causes which
      can be detected with this method. Two sample prostate cases show the occurrence
      of a random and systematic difference and identify the organ that causes the
      difference. In a lung cancer case a trend is shown of a rapidly diminishing
      atelectasis (lung fluid) during the course of treatment, which was detected with 
      this trend analysis method. The final example is a breast cancer case where we
      show the influence of set-up differences on the 2D transit dose. A method is
      presented based on 2D portal transit dosimetry to record dose changes throughout 
      the course of treatment, and to allow trend analysis of dose discrepancies. We
      show in example cases that this method can identify the causes of dose delivery
      differences and that treatment adaptation can be triggered as a result. It
      provides an important element toward informed decision-making for adaptive
      radiotherapy.

TI  - Susceptibility to cytotoxic T cell lysis of cancer stem cells derived from
      cervical and head and neck tumor cell lines.
PG  - 159-70
LID - 10.1007/s00432-012-1311-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To explore cancer stem cell susceptibility to a host's cytotoxic T
      lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response. METHODS: We compared the
      susceptibility of putative CSC generated from cancer cell lines to immunologic
      recognition and killing by alloantigen-specific CD8(+) CTL. CSC-enriched spheroid
      culture-derived cells (SDC) exhibited higher expression of ALDH, ICAM1 and of
      stem/progenitor cell markers on all 3 tumor cell lines investigated and lower MHC
      class I on the cervical cancer cell line as compared to their monolayer-derived
      cells (MDC). RESULTS: The expression of ICAM1 and MHCI was upregulated by
      IFN-gamma treatment. CSC populations were less sensitive to MHC class
      I-restricted alloantigen-specific CD8(+) CTL lysis as compared to matched MDC.
      IFN-gamma pretreatment resulted in over-proportionally enhanced lysis of SDC.
      Finally, the subset of ALDH(high) expressing SDC presented more sensitivity
      toward CD8(+) CTL killing than the ALDH(low) SDC. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor therapy
      resistance has been attributed to cancer stem cells (CSC). We show in vitro
      susceptibility of CSC to CTL-mediated lysis. Immunotherapy targeting of ALDH(+)
      CSC may therefore be a promising approach. Our results and method may be helpful 
      for the development and optimization of adjuvants, as here exemplified for
      INF-gamma, for CSC-targeted vaccines, independent of the availability of
      CSC-specific antigens.

TI  - Unbiased estimates of long-term net survival of solid cancers in France.
PG  - 2370-7
LID - 10.1002/ijc.27857 [doi]
AB  - In cancer studies, net survival (observed if cancer was the only cause of death) 
      is a useful indicator but survival estimation at 5 years is insufficient for
      planning healthcare needs. We estimated the net survivals at 5 and 10 years in a 
      cohort of 387,961 patients who had solid tumors between 1989 and 2004 and were
      followed-up until January 1, 2008. The cases were actively followed-up. Net
      survival was estimated with the unbiased Pohar-Perme method. The standardized net
      survival used the international cancer survival standard weights. In men, the
      standardized net survivals ranged from 92% at 5 years and 89% at 10 years
      (testis) to 6% at 5 years and 5% at 10 years (pancreas). In women, it ranged from
      91% at 5 years and 88% at 10 years (thyroid) to 10% at 5 years and 7% at 10 years
      (pancreas). The most frequent cancers had the highest net survivals: 84% at 5
      years and 71% at 10 years for prostate and 84% at 5 years and 74% at 10 years for
      breast cancer. Advanced age was associated with poorer prognosis. In most
      cancers, the net survivals at 5 and 10 years increased over periods of diagnosis.
      Net cancer survival is unaffected by mortalities due to other causes. It is the
      only indicator suitable for comparisons between countries or periods of diagnosis
      within a given country. The 10-year net survival confirmed the persistent
      unfavorable role of age in prognosis and the general improvement of cancer
      management over the last decade.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, interferon-inducible guanylate binding protein (GBP2) has
      been discussed as a possible control factor in tumor development, which is
      controlled by p53, and inhibits NF-Kappa B and Rac protein as well as expression 
      of matrix metalloproteinase 9. However, the potential role that GBP2 plays in
      tumor development and prognosis has not yet been studied. METHODS: We analyzed
      whether GBP2 mRNA levels are associated with metastasis-free interval in 766
      patients with node negative breast carcinomas who did not receive systemic
      chemotherapy. Furthermore, response to anthracycline-based chemotherapy was
      studied in 768 breast cancer patients. RESULTS: High expression of GBP2 in breast
      carcinomas was associated with better prognosis in the univariate (P < 0.001,
      hazard ratio 0.763, 95 % CI 0.650-0.896) as well as in the multivariate Cox
      analysis (P = 0.008, hazard ratio 0.731, 95 % CI 0.580-0.920) adjusted to the
      established clinical factors age, pT stage, grading, hormone and ERBB2 receptor
      status. The association was particularly strong in subgroups with high
      proliferation and positive estrogen receptor status but did not reach
      significance in carcinomas with low expression of proliferation associated genes.
      Besides its prognostic capacity, GBP2 also predicted pathologically complete
      response to anthracycline-based chemotherapy (P = 0.0037, odds ratio 1.39, 95 %
      CI 1.11-1.74). Interestingly, GBP2 correlated with a recently established T cell 
      signature, indicating tumor infiltration with T cells (R = 0.607, P < 0.001).
      CONCLUSION: GBP2 is associated with better prognosis in fast proliferating tumors
      and probably represents a marker of an efficient T cell response.

TI  - Inflammatory breast cancer in north Africa: comparison of clinical and molecular 
      epidemiologic characteristics of patients from Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco.
PG  - 159-69
LID - 10.3233/BD-2012-000337 [doi]
AB  - Understanding molecular characteristics that distinguish inflammatory breast
      cancer (IBC) from non-IBC is crucial for elucidating breast cancer etiology and
      management. We included 3 sets of patients from Egypt (48 IBC and 64 non-IBC),
      Tunisia (24 IBC and 40 non-IBC), and Morocco (42 IBC and 41 non-IBC). Egyptian
      IBC patients had the highest combined erythema, edema, peau d'orange, and
      metastasis among the 3 IBC groups. Egyptian IBC tumors had the highest RhoC
      expression than Tunisians and Moroccan IBCs (87% vs. 50%, vs. 38.1, for the 3
      countries, respectively). Tumor emboli were more frequent in Egyptian IBC than
      non-IBC (Mean +/- SD: 14.1 +/- 14.0 vs. 7.0 +/- 12.9, respectively) (P < 0.001)
      and Tunisians (Mean +/- SD: 3.4 +/- 2.5 vs. 1.9 +/- 2.0, respectively) (P <
      0.01). There was no difference of emboli in Moroccan tumors (1.7 +/- 1.2 vs. 1.8 
      +/- 1.2 for IBC and non-IBC, respectively (P=0.66). This study illustrates that
      RhoC overexpression and tumor emboli are more frequent in IBC relative to non-IBC
      from Egypt and Tunisia. Tumors of Moroccans were significantly different from
      Egyptian and Tunisian tumors for RhoC expression and emboli. Future studies
      should focus on relating epidemiologic factors and clinical pictures to molecular
      features of IBC in these and other populations.

TI  - Soluble c-Met protein as a susceptible biomarker for gastric cancer risk: A
      nested case-control study within the Korean Multicenter Cancer Cohort.
PG  - 2148-56
LID - 10.1002/ijc.27861 [doi]
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the relevance of the soluble form of c-Met
      protein, a truncated form of the c-Met membrane receptor involved in the CagA
      pathway, as a potential biomarker for gastric cancer. Among 290 gastric cancer
      case-control sets selected from the Korean Multicenter Cancer Cohort, the plasma 
      concentrations of soluble c-Met protein were measured with enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assays. Using analysis of variance and covariance models with age, 
      sex, smoking, Helicobacter pylori infection, and CagA seropositivity, the mean
      concentrations of soluble c-Met protein between cases and controls were compared.
      To evaluate the association between gastric cancer and a c-Met protein level,
      odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using conditional
      logistic regression models. Interactions between CagA-related genes and the
      soluble c-Met protein concentration were also investigated. The overall median
      plasma concentration of soluble c-Met among cases was significantly lower than
      those of controls (1.390 vs. 1.610 ng/mL, p < 0.0001). Closer to the onset of
      gastric cancer, the soluble c-Met protein level decreased linearly in a
      time-dependent manner (p for trend = 0.0002). The combined effects between the
      CagA-related genes and the soluble c-Met protein concentration significantly
      intensified risks for gastric cancer. Restricted analyses including cases that
      had been diagnosed within 1 year after entering the cohort had a fair degree of
      ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.73-0.77) to 
      discriminate gastric cancer cases from normal controls. Our findings demonstrate 
      the potential of the soluble form of c-Met protein as a novel biomarker for
      gastric cancer. The beneficial effects of a high soluble c-Met concentration in
      human plasma are strongly supported.

TI  - Systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence for flexible sigmoidoscopy as
      a screening method for the prevention of colorectal cancer.
PG  - 1488-500
LID - 10.1002/bjs.8882 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is a significant cause of death. Removal of
      precancerous adenomas, and early detection and treatment of cancer, has been
      shown to reduce the risk of death. The aim of this review and meta-analysis was
      to determine whether flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) is an effective population
      screening method for reducing mortality from colorectal cancer. METHODS: MEDLINE 
      (1946 to December 2012) and Embase (1980-2012, week 15) were searched for
      randomized clinical trials in which FS was used to screen non-symptomatic adults 
      from a general population, and FS was compared with either no screening or any
      other alternative screening methods. Meta-analysis was carried out using a
      random-effects Mantel-Haenzsel model. RESULTS: Twenty-four papers met the
      inclusion criteria, reporting results from 14 trials. Uptake of FS was usually
      lower than that for stool-based tests, although FS was more effective at
      detecting advanced adenoma and carcinoma. FS reduced the incidence of colorectal 
      cancer after screening, and long-term mortality from colorectal cancer, compared 
      with no screening in a selected population. Compared with stool-based tests in a 
      general population, FS was associated with fewer interval cancers. CONCLUSION: FS
      is efficacious at reducing colorectal cancer mortality compared with no
      screening. It is more effective at detecting advanced adenoma and carcinoma than 
      stool-based tests. FS may be compromised by poorer uptake. Introduction of FS as 
      a screening method should be done on a pilot basis in populations in which it is 
      not currently used, and close attention should be paid to maximizing uptake. The 
      relative risk of adverse events with FS compared with stool-based tests should be
      quantified, and its real-world effectiveness evaluated against the most effective
      stool-based tests.

TI  - The tumor suppressor microRNA-29c is downregulated and restored by celecoxib in
      human gastric cancer cells.
PG  - 1751-60
LID - 10.1002/ijc.27862 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that function as endogenous silencers
      of target genes and play critical roles during carcinogenesis. The selective
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib has been highlighted as a potential 
      drug for treatment of gastrointestinal tumors. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the role of miRNAs in gastric carcinogenesis and the feasibility of a
      new therapeutic approach for gastric cancer. miRNA expression profiles were
      examined in 53 gastric tumors including gastric adenomas (atypical epithelia),
      early gastric cancers and advanced gastric cancers and in gastric cancer cells
      treated with celecoxib. miRNA microarray analysis revealed that miR-29c was
      significantly downregulated in gastric cancer tissues relative to nontumor
      gastric mucosae. miR-29c was significantly activated by celecoxib in gastric
      cancer cells. Downregulation of miR-29c was associated with progression of
      gastric cancer and was more prominent in advanced gastric cancers than in gastric
      adenomas and early gastric cancer. In addition, expression of the oncogene Mcl-1,
      a target of miR-29c, was significantly increased in gastric cancer tissues
      relative to nontumor gastric mucosae. Activation of miR-29c by celecoxib induced 
      suppression of Mcl-1 and apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. These results suggest
      that downregulation of the tumor suppressor miR-29c plays critical roles in the
      progression of gastric cancer. Selective COX-2 inhibitors may have clinical
      promise for the treatment of gastric cancer via restoration of miR-29c.

TI  - Genetic polymorphisms in centrobin and Nek2 are associated with breast cancer
      susceptibility in a Chinese Han population.

AB  - Centrosome aberrations have been suggested to cause chromosomal instability and
      aneuploidy, and eventually promote cancer development. The Centrobin and Nek2
      proteins interact with each other and both are involved in centrosome duplication
      and chromosome segregation. This study aimed to investigate whether genetic
      polymorphisms in these two genes may affect breast cancer susceptibility in
      Chinese Han population using a haplotype-based analysis. Five single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in centrobin and four SNPs in Nek2 were genotyped in 1,215
      cases of infiltrating ductal breast cancer and 1,215 age-matched cancer-free
      controls from Chinese Han population. The results showed that CATCG haplotype of 
      centrobin was strongly associated with decreased breast cancer risk (adjusted OR 
      = 0.14, 95 % CI = 0.09-0.22), which was mainly driven by the C allele of SNP
      rs11650083 (A>C, located in exon 12, resulting in Pro578Gln). None of the
      individual SNPs in Nek2 was associated with breast cancer risk. However,
      haplotype GTAT of Nek2 was associated with increased risk of breast cancer
      (adjusted OR = 1.56, 95 % CI = 1.18-2.06) and its risk was significantly elevated
      among women with both family history of cancer and a longer menarche-first
      full-term pregnancy (FFTP) interval (>11 years) (adjusted OR = 5.31, 95 % CI =
      1.97-14.32). Furthermore, women harboring both at-risk haplotype GTAT of Nek2 and
      protective haplotype CATCG of centrobin were linked with decreased breast cancer 
      risk, suggesting that the association between genetic variants of Nek2 and
      increased breast cancer risk was modified by genetic variants of centrobin. Our
      results indicate that genetic polymorphisms of centrobin and Nek2 are related to 
      breast cancer susceptibility in Chinese Han women.

TI  - Combination antiangiogenic therapy in advanced breast cancer: a phase 1 trial of

      platelet proteomics.
PG  - 169-78

AB  - This phase 1 study evaluated the safety and tolerability of antiangiogenic
      therapy using vandetanib and metronomic cyclophosphamide and methotrexate in
      metastatic breast cancer. Eligible patients had metastatic breast cancer with 0-4
      prior chemotherapy regimens. All received cyclophosphamide 50 mg daily,
      methotrexate 2.5 mg days 1-2 weekly, and vandetanib daily in 3 dose-escalation
      cohorts: 100 mg (C1), 200 mg (C2), and 300 mg (C3). The primary endpoint was
      safety and tolerability; secondary endpoints included response rate and
      evaluation of platelet-associated proteins. Twenty three patients were treated
      and evaluable for toxicity. Common mild toxicities included nausea, vomiting,
      LFTs abnormalities, fatigue, and rash. Three episodes of dose-limiting toxicity
      occurred in C3. In all cohorts, 1/3 of patients required vandetanib dose
      reduction, and 22 % ended therapy for toxicity. Of the 20 response-evaluable
      patients, 10 % demonstrated partial response and 15 % stable disease >/=24 weeks.
      Proteomic analyses demonstrated changes in platelet content of angiogenesis
      regulators, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet factor 4,
      with exposure to therapy. This regimen was tolerable at a maximum vandetanib dose
      of 200 mg; modest clinical activity was observed in this heavily pretreated
      population. Changes in the platelet proteome may serve as pharmacodynamic markers
      of angiogenesis inhibition. Metronomic chemotherapy is an attractive partner with
      biologics and deserves further study in metastatic breast cancer.

TI  - Inhibition of PRC2 histone methyltransferase activity increases TRAIL-mediated
      apoptosis sensitivity in human colon cancer cells.
PG  - 764-72
LID - 10.1002/jcp.24224 [doi]
AB  - Colorectal cancer is ranked among the top leading causes of cancer death in
      industrialized populations. Polycomb group proteins, including Suz12 and Ezh2,
      are epigenetic regulatory proteins that act as transcriptional repressors of many
      differentiation-associated genes and are overexpressed in a large subset of
      colorectal cancers. Retinoic acid (RA) acts as a negative regulator of PcG
      actions in stem cells, but has shown limited therapeutic potential in some solid 
      tumors, including colorectal cancer, in part because of retinoic acid receptor
      beta silencing. Through treatment with RA, Suz12 shRNA knockdown, or Ezh2
      pharmacological inhibition with 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), we increased
      TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cell lines. This increased
      apoptosis in human colon cancer cells after RA or DZNep treatment was associated 
      with a ~2.5-fold increase in TNFRSF10B (DR5) transcript levels and a 42%
      reduction in the H3K27me3 epigenetic mark at the TNFRSF10B promoter after DZNep
      addition. Taken together, our findings indicate that pharmacological inhibition
      of Polycomb repressive complex 2 histone methyltransferase activity may
      constitute a new epigenetic therapeutic strategy to overcome RA
      non-responsiveness in a subset of colorectal tumors by increasing TRAIL-mediated 
      apoptosis sensitivity.

TI  - Linker for activation of T-cell family member2 (LAT2) a lipid raft adaptor
      protein for AKT signaling, is an early mediator of alkylphospholipid
      anti-leukemic activity.
PG  - 1898-912
LID - 10.1074/mcp.M112.019661 [doi]
AB  - Lipid rafts are highly ordered membrane domains rich in cholesterol and
      sphingolipids that provide a scaffold for signal transduction proteins; altered
      raft structure has also been implicated in cancer progression. We have shown that
      25 mum 10-(octyloxy) decyl-2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl phosphate (ODPC), an
      alkylphospholipid, targets high cholesterol domains in model membranes and
      induces apoptosis in leukemia cells but spares normal hematopoietic and
      epithelial cells under the same conditions. We performed a quantitative (SILAC)
      proteomic screening of ODPC targets in a lipid-raft-enriched fraction of leukemic
      cells to identify early events prior to the initiation of apoptosis. Six
      proteins, three with demonstrated palmitoylation sites, were reduced in
      abundance. One, the linker for activation of T-cell family member 2 (LAT2), is an
      adaptor protein associated with lipid rafts in its palmitoylated form and is
      specifically expressed in B lymphocytes and myeloid cells. Interestingly, LAT2 is
      not expressed in K562, a cell line more resistant to ODPC-induced apoptosis.
      There was an early loss of LAT2 in the lipid-raft-enriched fraction of NB4 cells 
      within 3 h following treatment with 25 mum ODPC. Subsequent degradation of LAT2
      by proteasomes was observed. Twenty-five mum ODPC inhibited AKT activation via
      myeloid growth factors, and LAT2 knockdown in NB4 cells by shRNA reproduced this 
      effect. LAT2 knockdown in NB4 cells also decreased cell proliferation and
      increased cell sensitivity to ODPC (7.5x), perifosine (3x), and arsenic trioxide 
      (8.5x). Taken together, these data indicate that LAT2 is an early mediator of the
      anti-leukemic activity of alkylphospholipids and arsenic trioxide. Thus, LAT2 may
      be used as a target for the design of drugs for cancer therapy.

TI  - Expression and prognostic significance of apoptotic genes in oral squamous cell
      carcinoma.
PG  - 264-71
LID - 10.1002/mc.21960 [doi]
AB  - Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common malignancy of oral cavity.
      Human cancers are characterized by an imbalance of regulatory mechanisms
      controlling different cellular pathways, including apoptosis. Apoptosis occurs in
      a wide variety of physiological processes, such as embryonic development, tissue 
      homeostasis or immune defense, and its role is to remove harmful, damaged, or
      unwanted cells. Defective apoptosis represents an important causative factor in
      the development/progression of cancer, and the ability of tumor cells to evade
      apoptosis can play a significant role in their resistance to conventional
      anticancer treatment. We investigated the expression profile of genes involved in
      the apoptotic mechanism in 21 paired tissue samples (OSCC and adjacent normal
      oral mucosa) by cDNA macroarray, in order to identify differentially expressed
      genes in oral cancer compared to normal tissue. To validate the results obtained 
      by cDNA macroarray, quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, and
      immunohistochemical analyses were performed. Results obtained by cDNA macroarray 
      analysis showed different expression levels of CRADD, FADD, ATM, APAF1, and TP63 
      genes in OSCC compared to normal mucosa. Differential gene expression
      measurements (tumor vs. normal tissue) performed by real-time PCR showed an
      overexpression of FADD and a downregulation of ATM. Moreover, Western blot
      analysis confirmed that both CRADD and APAF-1 were decreased in OSCC compared to 
      normal oral mucosa. As showed by immunohistochemistry, OSCC exhibited increased
      expression of p63 compared to normal tissue. Interestingly, a statistically
      significant positive correlation was found between p63 expression and the
      histological grade.

TI  - HBx induces HepG-2 cells autophagy through PI3K/Akt-mTOR pathway.
PG  - 161-8
LID - 10.1007/s11010-012-1457-x [doi]
AB  - Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is the dominant global cause of
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially hepatitis B virus-X (HBx) plays a
      major role in this process. HBx protein promotes cell cycle progression,
      inactivates negative growth regulators, and binds to and inhibits the expression 
      of p53 tumor suppressor gene and other tumor suppressor genes and
      senescence-related factors. However, the relationship between HBx and autophagy
      during the HCC development is poorly known. Previous studies found that autophagy
      functions as a survival mechanism in liver cancer cells. We suggest that
      autophagy plays a possible role in the pathogenesis of HBx-induced HCC. The
      present study showed that HBx transfection brought about an increase in the
      formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes. Microtubule-associated protein
      light chain 3, Beclin 1, and lysosome-associated membrane protein 2a were
      up-regulated after HBx transfection. HBx-induced increase in the autophagic level
      was increased by mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and was blocked by treatment with the
      PI3K-Akt inhibitor LY294002. The same results can also be found in HepG2.2.15
      cells. These results suggest that HBx activates the autophagic lysosome pathway
      in HepG-2 cells through the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway.

TI  - Effects of curcumin on bleomycin-induced apoptosis in human malignant testicular 
      germ cells.
PG  - 289-96
LID - 10.1007/s13105-012-0211-x [doi]
AB  - Testicular cancer is the most common cancer among young men of reproductive age. 
      Bleomycin is a frequently used drug for the treatment of several malignancies and
      is part of the chemotherapy protocols in testicular cancer. Bleomycin causes an
      increase in oxidative stress which has been shown to induce apoptosis in cancer
      cells. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), an active component of the spice turmeric,
      has attracted interest because of its anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive
      activities. However, no study has been carried out so far to elucidate its
      interaction with bleomycin in testicular cancer cells. In this study, we
      investigated the effects of curcumin and bleomycin on apoptosis signalling
      pathways and compared the effects of bleomycin with H2O2 which directly produces 
      reactive oxygen species. We measured apoptosis markers such as caspase-3,
      caspase-8, and caspase-9 activities and Bcl-2, Bax, and Cyt-c levels in NCCIT
      cells incubated with curcumin (5 muM), bleomycin (120 mug/ml), bleomycin +
      curcumin, H2O2 (35 muM), and H2O2 + curcumin for 72 h. Curcumin, bleomycin, and
      H2O2 caused apoptosis indicated as increases in caspase-3, caspase-8, and
      caspase-9 activities and Bax and cytoplasmic Cyt-c levels and a decrease in Bcl-2
      level. Concurrent use of curcumin with bleomycin decreased caspase activities and
      Bax and Cyt-c levels compared to their separate effects in NCCIT cells. Our
      findings suggest that concurrent use of curcumin during chemotherapy in testis
      cancer should be avoided due to the inhibitory effect of curcumin on
      bleomycin-induced apoptosis.

TI  - Involvement of annexin A8 in the properties of pancreatic cancer.
PG  - 181-91
LID - 10.1002/mc.21961 [doi]
AB  - Although Annexin A8 (ANXA8), a member of a superfamily of calcium and
      phospholipid binding proteins, is physiologically expressed in a tissue-specific 
      manner, recent microarray studies reported that ANXA8 was also ectopically
      expressed in pancreatic cancers. We investigated the molecular mechanism of
      expression of ANXA8 in cancer cells and its functional role in pancreatic cancer 
      cells. ANXA8 was diversely expressed in human cancer cell lines. Expression was
      enhanced by treatment with 5-aza-dC and butyrate, and correlated with methylation
      status at CpG in the promoter-exon 1 region. Inhibition of ANXA8 using siRNA in
      BxPC-3 cells which express ANXA8 at a high level elevated caspase-3 and -7
      activities. In in vitro invasion assay, inhibition of ANXA8 using siRNA in BxPC-3
      reduced the numbers of migrating cells, and down-regulated HIF-1alpha mRNA
      transcription. Overexpression of ANXA8 increased the number of viable cells and
      BrdU incorporation in PANC-1 cells, which express ANXA8 at a low level.
      Expression of ANXA8 was induced under conditions of nutrient deprivation, and
      overexpression of ANXA8 showed resistance against serum starvation in PANC-1
      cells. In a promoter assay, co-transfection with the expression vector of ANXA8
      and the vector of a reporter gene containing the promoter of HIF-1alpha enhanced 
      HIF-1alpha promoter activity. In contrast, this effect of ANXA8 was inhibited by 
      administration of BAPTA-AM, an intracellular Ca(2)(+) chelator. These results
      suggest that ectopic ANXA8 expression in cancer cells might involve an epigenetic
      mechanism. ANXA8 might play an important role in calcium fluctuation-mediated
      HIF-1alpha transcriptional activation and cell viability.

TI  - Gold nanoprisms as optoacoustic signal nanoamplifiers for in vivo bioimaging of
      gastrointestinal cancers.
PG  - 68-74
LID - 10.1002/smll.201201779 [doi]
AB  - Early detection of cancer greatly increases the chances of a simpler and more
      effective treatment. Traditional imaging techniques are often limited by shallow 
      penetration, low sensitivity, low specificity, poor spatial resolution or the use
      of ionizing radiation. Hybrid modalities, like optoacoustic imaging, an emerging 
      molecular imaging modality, contribute to improving most of these limitations.
      However, this imaging method is hindered by relatively low signal contrast. Here,
      gold nanoprisms (AuNPrs) are used as signal amplifiers in multispectral
      optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) to visualize gastrointestinal cancer. PEGylated
      AuNPrs are successfully internalized by HT-29 gastrointestinal cancer cells in
      vitro. Moreover, the particles show good biocompatibility and exhibit a surface
      plasmon band centered at 830 nm, a suitable wavelength for optoacoustic imaging
      purposes. These findings extend well to an in vivo setting, in which mice are
      injected with PEGylated AuNPrs in order to visualize tumor angiogenesis in
      gastrointestinal cancer cells. Overall, both our in vitro and in vivo results
      show that PEGylated AuNPrs have the capacity to penetrate tumors and provide a
      high-resolution signal amplifier for optoacoustic imaging. The combination of
      PEGylated AuNPrs and MSOT represents a significant advance for the in vivo
      imaging of cancers.

TI  - PPARgamma antagonist GW9662 induces functional estrogen receptor in mouse mammary
      organ culture: potential translational significance.
PG  - 249-56
LID - 10.1007/s11010-012-1466-9 [doi]
AB  - The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)
      plays a central role in regulating metabolism, including interaction with the
      estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha). Significantly, PPARgamma activity can be
      modulated by small molecules to control cancer both in vitro and in vivo (Yin et 
      al., Cancer Res 69:687-694, 2009). Here, we evaluated the effects of the
      PPARgamma agonist GW7845 and the PPARgamma antagonist GW9662 on DMBA-induced
      mammary alveolar lesions (MAL) in a mouse mammary organ culture. The results were
      as follows: (a) the incidence of MAL development was significantly inhibited by
      GW 7845 and GW 9662; (b) GW9662 but not GW7845, in the presence of estradiol,
      induced ER and PR expression in mammary glands and functional ERalpha in MAL; (c)
      while GW9662 inhibited expression of adipsin and ap2, GW 7845 enhanced expression
      of these PPARgamma-response genes; and (d) Tamoxifen caused significant
      inhibition of GW9662 treated MAL, suggesting that GW9662 sensitizes MAL to
      antiestrogen treatment, presumably through rendering functional ERalpha and
      induction of PR. The induction of ERalpha by GW9662, including newer analogs, may
      permit use of anti-ER strategies to inhibit breast cancer in ER- patients.

TI  - Association of the miR-146aC>G, miR-149T>C, miR-196a2T>C, and miR-499A>G
      polymorphisms with gastric cancer risk and survival in the Korean population.
PG  - E39-51

AB  - We investigated whether four common microRNA polymorphisms (miR-146aC>G
      [rs2910164], miR-149T>C [rs2292832], miR-196a2T>C [rs11614913], and miR-499A>G
      [rs3746444]) are associated with the susceptibility and prognosis of gastric
      cancer in the Korean population. The four microRNA single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in a case-control study (461 patients; 447
      controls) by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism
      (PCR-RFLP) analysis in the Korean population. When patients were stratified into 
      diffuse and intestinal-type gastric cancer groups, subjects with the miR-499AG
      and AG + GG genotypes had reduced adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for diffuse-type
      gastric cancer (AOR = 0.54 with 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.31-0.97; AOR =
      0.57 with 95% CI = 0.33-0.97). In the stratified analyses for gastric cancer
      risk, the miR-146aGG and CG + GG genotypes were associated with increased risk of
      gastric cancers among the non-smokers, whereas the miR-149TC and TC + CC
      genotypes showed lower risk of gastric cancer in males. The miR-196a2CC genotype 
      was associated with elevated gastric cancer risk among females. For gastric
      cancer prognosis, intestinal-type gastric cancer patients with miR-146aCG + GG
      genotypes had significantly higher survival rates (log-rank P = 0.030) than
      patients with the CC genotype, and patients with the miR-499AA genotype had
      significantly increased survival rates compared to patients with the AG + GG
      genotypes (log-rank P = 0.013). When miR-146aCG + GG and miR-499AA genotypes were
      combined, the survival rate of intestinal-type gastric cancer patients was
      elevated (log-rank P < 0.001). No association was found between gastric or
      diffuse-type cancer prognosis and other miRNAs. Our data demonstrate that
      specific miRNA SNPs are associated with gastric cancer susceptibility
      (miR-499A>G) and prognosis (miR-146aC>G and miR-499A>G) in the Korean population 
      depending on gastric cancer type.

      Student Training program for Navajo undergraduate students.
PG  - 92-9
LID - 10.1007/s13187-012-0417-1 [doi]
AB  - The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center and Dine College received funding for a 4-year
      collaborative P20 planning grant from the National Cancer Institute in 2006. The 
      goal of the partnership was to increase Navajo undergraduates' interest in and
      commitment to biomedical coursework and careers, especially in cancer research.
      This paper describes the development, pilot testing, and evaluation of Native
      CREST (Cancer Research Experience and Student Training), a 10-week cancer
      research training program providing mentorship in a Mayo Clinic basic science or 
      behavioral cancer research lab for Navajo undergraduate students. Seven Native
      American undergraduate students (five females, two males) were enrolled during
      the summers of 2008-2011. Students reported the program influenced their career
      goals and was valuable to their education and development. These efforts may
      increase the number of Native American career scientists developing and
      implementing cancer research, which will ultimately benefit the health of Native 
      American people.

TI  - Joint modeling quality of life and survival using a terminal decline model in
      palliative care studies.
PG  - 1394-406
LID - 10.1002/sim.5635 [doi]
AB  - Palliative medicine is a relatively new specialty that focuses on preventing and 
      relieving the suffering of patients facing life-threatening illness. For cancer
      patients, clinical trials have been carried out to compare concurrent palliative 
      care with usual cancer care in terms of longitudinal measurements of quality of
      life (QOL) until death, and overall survival is usually treated as a secondary
      endpoint. It is known that QOL of patients with advanced cancer decreases as
      death approaches; however, in previous clinical trials, this association has
      generally not been taken into account when inferences about the effect of an
      intervention on QOL or survival have been made. We developed a new joint modeling
      approach, a terminal decline model, to study the trajectory of repeated
      measurements and survival in a recently completed palliative care study. This
      approach takes the association of survival and QOL into account by modeling QOL
      retrospectively from death. For those patients whose death times are censored,
      marginal likelihood is used to incorporate them into the analysis. Our approach
      has two submodels: a piecewise linear random intercept model with serial
      correlation and measurement error for the retrospective trajectory of QOL and a
      piecewise exponential model for the survival distribution. Maximum likelihood
      estimators of the parameters are obtained by maximizing the closed-form
      expression of log-likelihood function. An explicit expression of quality-adjusted
      life years can also be derived from our approach. We present a detailed data
      analysis of our previously reported palliative care randomized clinical trial.

TI  - Heterozygosity for TGF beta1 -509C/T Polymorphism is associated with risk for
      breast cancer in South Indian population.
PG  - 99-105
LID - 10.1007/s13277-012-0516-y [doi]
AB  - Transformation growth factor beta1 is a multipotent cytokine that mediates the
      development, differentiation, and neoplasm of the mammary gland. TGF beta1 is
      known to exert both tumor suppressive and progressive effect at different stages 
      of carcinogenesis. Several studies have shown the association of TGF beta1
      expression with breast cancer markers like estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
      receptor (PR), and Her2/neu. TGF beta1 expression is known to be influenced by
      -509C/T promoter polymorphism. Hence, the present study is aimed to evaluate the 
      possible role of TGF beta1 -509C/T promoter polymorphism in breast cancer and its
      association with ER, PR, and Her2 status based on case-control study in South
      Indian population from Andhra Pradesh. Our study revealed a significant increase 
      of CT genotype in breast cancer patients compared to controls (CT vs. CC: chi (2)
      = 6.054, P = 0.014, OR 2.005, 95 % CI 1.182-3.403). However, there was no
      correlation between TGF beta1 -509C/T polymorphism and other factors like age at 
      onset, ER, PR, Her2 status, etc. Further, CT genotype was found to be associated 
      with increased risk in advanced stages of breast cancer (CC vs. CT: OR 2.315, 95 
      % CI 1.143-4.688) and a border line significance with postmenopausal women (CT
      vs. CC: chi (2) = 3.128, P = 0.07, OR 2.095, 95 % CI 0.991-4.428).

TI  - Risk of malignancy in unilocular cysts: a study of 1148 adnexal masses classified
      as unilocular cysts at transvaginal ultrasound and review of the literature.
PG  - 80-9
LID - 10.1002/uog.12308 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to estimate the rate of malignancy in
      adnexal lesions described as unilocular cysts at transvaginal ultrasound
      examination and to investigate if there are differences in clinical and
      ultrasound characteristics between benign and malignant unilocular cysts.
      METHODS: A total of 3511 patients with an adnexal mass underwent transvaginal
      ultrasound examination between 1999 and 2007. Sonologists used the International 
      Ovarian Tumor Analysis terms and definitions to describe their ultrasound
      findings. Only masses operated on within 120 days after the ultrasound
      examination were included in the analysis and the histopathological diagnosis of 
      the mass was used as the gold standard. RESULTS: Of the 3511 masses, 1148 (33%)
      were classified as unilocular cysts on ultrasound. Of these, 11 (0.96% (95% CI,
      0.48-1.71)) were malignant. The malignancy rate was lower in premenopausal than
      in postmenopausal women: 0.54% (5/931; 95% CI, 0.17-1.25) vs. 2.76% (6/217; 95%
      CI, 1.02-5.92); P = 0.009. More patients with malignant unilocular cysts had a
      personal history of breast cancer (18% vs. 2%; P = 0.02) or ovarian cancer (18%
      vs 0.6%; P = 0.003). Hemorrhagic cyst contents on ultrasound were more common in 
      malignant than in benign unilocular cysts (18% vs. 2%; P = 0.03). In seven of the
      11 malignancies judged to be unilocular cysts at scan, papillary projections or
      other solid components were seen at macroscopic inspection of the surgical
      specimen. CONCLUSIONS: The malignancy rate in surgically removed adnexal lesions 
      judged to be unilocular cysts at transvaginal scan is c 1%. Postmenopausal
      status, personal history of breast or ovarian cancer and hemorrhagic cyst
      contents on ultrasound increase the risk of malignancy. To avoid misclassifying
      adnexal lesions as unilocular cysts at scan, it is important to scrutinize
      unilocular cysts for the presence of solid components.

TI  - Overexpression and cytoplasmic accumulation of Hepl is associated with
      clinicopathological parameters and poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer.
PG  - 107-14
LID - 10.1007/s13277-012-0517-x [doi]
AB  - Hepl, first described in 2008, is the fourth member of the Crk-associated
      substrate (CAS) family and is specifically expressed in the lung. Compared to
      other CAS proteins, Hepl has a varying effect on cell migration in different cell
      types. We speculated that Hepl may play a role in lung cancer invasion and
      metastasis. We quantified the expression and subcellular localization of Hepl in 
      143 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues, adjacent noncancerous tissues,
      and eight lung cancer cell lines using Western blotting, immunohistochemistry,
      and immunofluorescent staining. Expression of Hepl was correlated with the
      clinicopathological features of NSCLC. Hepl was overexpressed in 72.3 % (103/143)
      of the NSCLC tissues, compared to the adjacent noncancerous lung tissues (P =
      0.022). Overexpression of Hepl was associated with lymph node metastasis and high
      TNM stage (P = 0.005 and P = 0.045, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival curves
      and the log-rank test indicated that overexpression of Hepl correlated with
      poorer overall survival in NSCLC (P < 0.001), and Cox regression analysis
      demonstrated that overexpression of Hepl was an independent prognostic factor in 
      NSCLC. Furthermore, cytoplasmic accumulation of Hepl was observed in a high
      metastatic potential lung cancer cell lines (H1299 and BE1), but not in low
      metastatic potential cell lines (LTE and A549). This study reveals that Hepl is
      overexpressed in the nucleus and aberrantly accumulates in the cytoplasm of NSCLC
      cells, and indicates that Hepl may play a role in the progression of lung cancer,
      including lymph node metastasis and TNM stage. Additionally, Hepl may be a useful
      prognostic factor in lung cancer.

AB  - Chemotherapy used as a treatment against lung cancer has influence on metabolic
      processes occurring in healthy cells. The changes of biochemical pathways
      proceeded inside cells might be observed in expired air. In the experiment,
      breath analysis was carried out before and after anticancer therapy. Expired air 
      samples were collected from 22 patients with a biopsy confirmed lung cancer.
      Volatile organic compounds present in breath were analyzed by gas
      chromatography/mass spectrometry. For enrichment of analytes solid-phase
      microextraction technique was applied. Eight fibers covered by different sorbents
      were tested. Carboxen-polydimethylsiloxane fiber revealed the highest extraction 
      efficiency in relation to analytes in breath. The data showed that cytostatic
      drugs increase the concentration of acetone and isoprene in the breath collected 
      after chemotherapy. Volatile metabolites of administrated drugs were not
      identified in expired air.

TI  - Initial testing (stage 1) of the phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase inhibitor,
      SAR245408 (XL147) by the pediatric preclinical testing program.
PG  - 791-8
LID - 10.1002/pbc.24301 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Activation of the PI3 kinase pathway occurs frequently in many adult 
      cancers and is implicated in tumor cell proliferation, survival, and resistance
      to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, less is known regarding the relevance 
      of this pathway in pediatric cancers. Here we have evaluated SAR245408, a novel
      small molecule PI3K inhibitor, against childhood cancer cell lines and
      xenografts. PROCEDURES: SAR245408 was tested against the PPTP in vitro cell line 
      panel at concentrations from 10 to 100 microM and against the PPTP in vivo
      xenograft panels at a dose of 100 mg/kg administered orally daily x 14. RESULTS: 
      In vitro SAR245408 demonstrated cytotoxic activity, with a median relative IC50
      value of 10.9 microM (range 2.7-24.5 microM). SAR245408 was well tolerated in
      vivo, and all 44 tested xenograft models were evaluable for efficacy. SAR245408
      induced significant differences in EFS distribution compared to control in 29 of 
      37 (79%) of solid tumor xenografts and in two of seven (29%) ALL xenografts.
      SAR245408 induced tumor growth inhibition meeting criteria for intermediate EFS
      T/C activity (EFS T/C > 2) in 4 of 37 (11%) solid tumor xenografts. Intermediate 
      EFS T/C activity was also observed for two of seven (29%) evaluable ALL
      xenografts. Objective responses were not observed for solid tumor or for ALL
      xenografts. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions evaluated in this study, SAR245408 
      achieved modest single-agent activity against most PPTP preclinical models.
      Further exploration of SAR245408 in combination with standard agents or with
      other signaling inhibitors could be considered.

TI  - Comparison of MRS and DWI in the diagnosis of prostate cancer based on sextant
      analysis.
PG  - 194-200
LID - 10.1002/jmri.23809 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, metabolic ratio 
      ((Cho + Cr)/Cit) and the combination of the two in identifying prostate malignant
      regions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-six consecutive patients with prostate
      biopsy results were retrospectively recruited in this study. Transrectal
      ultrasound-guided (TRUS) systemic prostate biopsies were used as a standard of
      reference. Mean ADC value and mean metabolic ratio (MMR) were calculated within
      each benign sextant region or malignant region. The efficiency of these two
      indices in prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis is estimated in Fisher linear
      discriminant analysis (FLDA). The area under the receiver operating
      characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the distinguishing capacity of
      mean ADC, MMR, and the combination of the two in differentiating between
      noncancerous and cancerous cases. RESULTS: There were significant differences for
      mean ADC value and MMR between malignant and benign regions. Weights of mean ADC 
      value obtained by FLDA were much higher than those of MMR. In differentiating
      malignant regions, both ADC alone and combined ADC and metabolic ratio performed 
      significantly better than MMR alone. However, accuracy improvements were not
      significant by using combined ADC and MMR than ADC alone. CONCLUSION: DWI is more
      efficient than MR spectroscopic (MRS) in the detection of PCa in this study.
      Combined ADC and MMR performed significantly better than MMR alone in
      distinguishing malignant from benign region in prostate peripheral zone.

TI  - Blunted response to a growth hormone stimulation test is associated with
      unfavorable cardiovascular risk factor profile in childhood cancer survivors.
PG  - 467-73
LID - 10.1002/pbc.24308 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer survivors (CCS) are at risk for growth hormone (GH) 
      deficiency. CCS are also at increased risk for early mortality from
      cardiovascular (CV) disease, but the association between GH levels and CV risk
      remains poorly understood. The goal of this study was to examine the
      cross-sectional association between stimulated GH levels and CV risk factors in
      CCS younger than 18 years. PROCEDURE: A total of 276 CCS (147 males, 14.4 +/- 2.6
      years) >/=5 years after cancer diagnosis, and 208 sibling controls (112 males,
      13.6 +/- 2.4 years) participated in this cross-sectional study, which included
      anthropometry, body composition, and metabolic studies. Blunted response (BR) was
      defined as peak GH level <7 microg/L after clonidine and arginine. Insulin
      sensitivity (M(lbm) ) was measured by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp.
      Statistical analyses used linear and logistic regression accounting for sibling
      clustering, adjusted for age, sex, Tanner stage, and adiposity. RESULTS:
      Thirty-four (12%) CCS showed BR to GH stimulation. BR CCS were shorter and had a 
      lower IGF-1 than controls; only 6 of 34 received cranial radiation therapy. CCS
      with normal stimulated GH response were similar to controls for CV risk factors. 
      Conversely, BR CCS had greater adiposity, higher lipids, and lower M(lbm) than
      controls. Differences in lipids and M(lbm) between BR CCS and controls remained
      significant after adjustment for BMI or visceral fat. CONCLUSIONS: BR to GH
      stimulation is prevalent in CCS youth and is associated with an unfavorable CV
      risk factor profile. Further studies are needed to establish the mechanisms of
      these associations.

      microenvironment in tumor tissue of colorectal cancer patients.

AB  - Colorectal cancer is one of the five leading causes of cancer mortality
      worldwide. The mechanisms of pathogen clearance, inflammation and regulation by T
      cells in the healthy bowel are also important in controlling tumor growth. The
      majority of studies analyzing T cells and their relationship to colorectal tumor 
      growth have focused on individual T cell markers or gene clusters and thus the
      complexity of the T cell response contributing to the growth of the tumor is not 
      clear. We have studied the T cells in colorectal cancer patients and have defined
      a unique T cell signature for colorectal tumor tissue. Using a novel analytical
      flow cytometric approach in concert with confocal microscopy, we have shown that 
      the tumor has a lower frequency of effector T cells (CD69+), but a higher
      frequency of both regulatory (CD25hi Foxp3+) and inflammatory T cells (IL-17+)
      compared with associated nontransformed bowel tissue. We have also identified
      minor populations of T cells expressing conventional markers of both inflammatory
      and regulatory T cells (CD4+IL-17+Foxp3+) in the tumor tissue. These cells may
      represent intermediate populations or they may dictate an inflammatory versus
      regulatory function in surrounding T cells. Together, these data describe an
      immune microenvironment in colorectal cancer unique to the tumor tissue and
      distinct from the surrounding healthy bowel tissue, and this distinct environment
      is reflected by a gradient of T cells expressing markers of multiple T cell
      populations. These findings may be used to improve diagnosis and prognosis of
      colorectal cancer patients.

TI  - Brush border myosin Ia inactivation in gastric but not endometrial tumors.
PG  - 1790-9
LID - 10.1002/ijc.27856 [doi]
AB  - Brush border Myosin Ia (MYO1A) has been shown to be frequently mutated in
      colorectal tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI) and to have tumor
      suppressor activity in intestinal tumors. Here, we investigated the frequency of 
      frameshift mutations in the A8 microsatellite in exon 28 of MYO1A in MSI gastric 
      and endometrial tumors and found a high mutation rate in gastric (22/47; 46.8%)
      but not endometrial (3/48; 6.2%) tumors. Using a regression model, we show that
      MYO1A mutations are likely to confer a growth advantage to gastric, but not
      endometrial tumors. The mutant MYO1A(7A) protein was shown to lose its membrane
      localization in gastric cancer cells and a cycloheximide-chase assay demonstrated
      that the mutant MYO1A(7A) protein has reduced stability compared to the wild type
      MYO1A. Frequent MYO1A promoter hypermethylation was also found in gastric tumors.
      Promoter methylation negatively correlates with MYO1A mRNA expression in a series
      of 58 non-MSI gastric primary tumors (Pearson's r = -0.46; p = 0.0003) but not in
      a cohort of 54 non-MSI endometrial tumors and treatment of gastric cancer cells
      showing high MYO1A promoter methylation with the demethylating agent
      5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, resulted in a significant increase of MYO1A mRNA levels. 
      We found that normal gastric epithelial cells, but not normal endometrial cells, 
      express high levels of MYO1A. Therefore, when considered together, our findings
      suggest that MYO1A has tumor suppressor activity in the normal gastric epithelium
      but not in the normal endometrium and inactivation of MYO1A either genetically or
      epigenetically may confer gastric epithelial cells a growth advantage.

      via melatonin-regulation of GSK3beta.
PG  - 1808-20
LID - 10.1210/me.2012-1071 [doi]
AB  - Disturbed sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythmicity are associated with cancer, 
      but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Employing a tissue-isolated human
      breast xenograft tumor nude rat model, we observed that glycogen synthase kinase 
      3beta (GSK3beta), an enzyme critical in metabolism and cell
      proliferation/survival, exhibits a circadian rhythm of phosphorylation in human
      breast tumors. Exposure to light-at-night suppresses the nocturnal pineal
      melatonin synthesis, disrupting the circadian rhythm of GSK3beta phosphorylation.
      Melatonin activates GSK3beta by inhibiting the serine-threonine kinase Akt
      phosphorylation, inducing beta-catenin degradation and inhibiting
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a fundamental process underlying cancer
      metastasis. Thus, chronic circadian disruption by light-at-night via occupational
      exposure or age-related sleep disturbances may contribute to cancer incidence and
      the metastatic spread of breast cancer by inhibiting GSK3beta activity and
      driving epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer patients.

AB  - Interleukin-20 (IL-20) is a proinflammatory cytokine involved in rheumatoid
      arthritis, atherosclerosis, and osteoporosis. However, little is known about the 
      role of IL-20 in oral cancer. We explored the function of IL-20 in the tumor
      progression of oral cancer. IL-20 expression levels in tumorous and nontumorous
      oral tissue specimens from 40 patients with four different stages oral cancer
      were analyzed with immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and quantitative real-time
      PCR (qRT-PCR). Expression of IL-20 and its receptor subunits was higher in
      clinical oral tumor tissue than in nontumorous oral tissue. The role of IL-20 was
      examined in two oral cancer cell lines (OC-3 and OEC-M1). In vitro, IL-20
      promoted TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, MCP-1, CCR4, and CXCR4 and increased proliferation,
      migration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and colony formation of oral
      cancer cells via activated STAT3 and AKT/JNK/ERK signals. To evaluate the
      therapeutic potential of anti-IL-20 monoclonal antibody 7E for treating oral
      cancer, an ex vivo tumor growth model was used. In vivo, 7E reduced tumor growth 
      and inflammation in oral cancer cells. In conclusion, IL-20 promoted oral tumor
      growth, migration, and tumor-associated inflammation. Therefore, IL-20 may be a
      novel target for treating oral cancer, and anti-IL-20 monoclonal antibody 7E may 
      be a feasible therapeutic.

AB  - Antiangiogenic drugs have been used as anticancer agents to target tumor
      endothelial cells or pericytes. Because of limited efficacy of the current
      monotherapies, there is a strong demand for the dual targeting of endothelial
      cells and pericytes. Here, we identify Olfactomedin-like 3 (Olfml3) as a novel
      proangiogenic cue within the tumor microenvironment. Tumor-derived Olfml3 is
      produced by both tumor endothelial cells and accompanying pericytes and deposited
      in the perivascular compartment. Blockade of Olfml3 by anti-Olfml3 antibodies is 
      highly effective in reducing tumor vascularization, pericyte coverage, and tumor 
      growth. In vitro, Olfml3 targeting is sufficient to inhibit endothelioma cell
      migration and sprouting. Olfml3 alone or through binding to BMP4 enhances the
      canonical SMAD1/5/8 signaling pathway required for BMP4-induced angiogenesis.
      Therefore, Olfml3 blockade provides a novel strategy to control tumor growth by
      targeting two distinct cell types within the tumor microenvironment using a
      single molecule.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is often indicated in cancer
      patients, many physicians are concerned about the risks potentially associated
      with the use of central venous access devices (VADs) in these patients. The aim
      of this prospective study was to investigate the actual incidence of VAD-related 
      complications in cancer patients on HPN. METHODS: All adult cancer patient
      candidates for VAD insertion and HPN were enrolled. The incidence of
      complications associated with 4 types of VADs (peripherally inserted central
      catheter [PICC], Hohn catheter, tunneled Groshong catheter, and port) was
      investigated, as well as the most significant risk factors. RESULTS: Two hundred 
      eighty-nine VADs in 254 patients were studied, for a total of 51,308
      catheter-days. The incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) 
      was low (0.35/1000 catheter-days), particularly for PICCs (0/1000; P < .01 vs
      Hohn and tunneled catheters) and for ports (0.19/1000; P < .01 vs Hohn and P <
      .05 vs tunneled catheters). Mechanical complications were uncommon (0.8/1000), as
      was VAD-related venous thrombosis (0.06/1000). Ultrasound-guided venipuncture was
      associated with a decreased risk of CRBSI (P < .04) and thrombosis (P < .001).
      VAD securement using sutureless devices reduced the risk of CRBSI and dislocation
      (P < .001). Hohn catheters had no advantage over PICCs (higher complication rate 
      and shorter dwell time; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In cancer patients, HPN can be
      safely carried out with a low incidence of complications. Also, VADs are not
      equal in terms of complication rates, and strict adherence to meticulous
      insertion policies may effectively reduce catheter-related complications.

TI  - A randomized feasibility study of docetaxel versus vinorelbine in advanced breast
      cancer.
PG  - 1429-e47
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2012-0161 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Docetaxel and vinorelbine have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment
      of metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This prospective feasibility study compared
      the efficacy of these two treatments in MBC. METHODS: Patients with MBC
      progressing following anthracycline treatment were randomly assigned to either
      docetaxel (100 mg/m(2)day 1 q3W) or vinorelbine (25mg/m(2) day 1 q2W). Patients
      were eligible to cross over at progression. Objective response rates (ORR), time 
      to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) were measured. RESULTS: 37
      patients were randomised. 2 patients were excluded due to protocol violations. Of
      35 remaining patients 17 received docetaxel and 18 received vinorelbine per
      protocol. ORR was 12.5% and 6.0% respectively for docetaxel and vinorelbine. The 
      median time to progression was 10.4 weeks (range 6-14 weeks) in docetaxel arm and
      7.6 weeks (range 4-11 weeks) in vinorelbine arm (p = .82). The clinical benefit
      rate (defined as complete response, partial response plus stable disease) was 44%
      in the docetaxel arm and 12% in the vinorelbine arm. Based on intent to treat the
      median OS in the docetaxel arm was 34 weeks (95% CI, 20.7-48) and 21.2 weeks (95%
      CI, 17-25.4) in vinorelbine arm (p = .388). 16 patients crossed over, 5 from
      docetaxel to vinorelbine and 11 from vinorelbine to docetaxel. At cross over the 
      ORR was 0% and 18% on cross over to vinorelbine and docetaxel respectively with a
      median TTP of 17.3 weeks (95% CI, 16.3-18.1) and 18.7 weeks (95% CI, 13.9-23.4)
      for those receiving vinorebine and docetaxel at cross over respectively.
      Vinorelbine however was much better tolerated with fewer grade 3-4 toxicity
      events (n = 4) than docetaxel (n = 27). DISCUSSION: While docetaxel resulted in a
      longer TTP and OS in this study it did not reach statistical significance. TTP
      duration for those patients who crossed over was similar, but overwhelmingly
      vinorelbine had fewer significant grade 3-4 toxicities than docetaxel. Only two
      previous randomized studies have compared the efficacy of single agent docetaxel 
      and vinorelbine following prior anthracycline exposure, one in an unselected
      population [16], and the other, HERNATA, in HER2 positive disease with
      trastuzumab used in both arms [17]. The patients randomized in this study were
      relatively heavily pretreated with the majority having received 2-3 lines of
      prior treatment for their metastatic disease. The lower response rates with
      vinorelbine as compared to docetaxel in this study concur with results reported
      in other studies [16]. However, the numbers in both this study and the other
      unselected study [16] are small and need to be interpreted with caution. With
      regard to toxicity, in the present study, grade 3-4 hematological adverse events 
      and infection were tenfold greater with docetaxel as compared with vinorelbine,
      consistent with results in HERNATA [17]. While others have reported a
      significantly higher number of overall grade 3-4 toxicities with vinorelbine
      [16], the fact that, as in HERNATA, discontinuations due to toxicities in that
      study [16] were significantly greater with docetaxel as compared to vinorelbine
      suggests either the toxicity data collected did not reflect the true toxicities
      on treatment or that docetaxel toxicities were in some way more severe or
      protracted leading to more numerous discontinuations [16]. Larger randomized
      studies are needed to determine (1) the efficacy of docetaxel versus vinorelbine 
      in anthracycline pretreated disease and (2) the efficacy of vinorelbine after
      prior taxane exposure, and particularly how it may compares both with regard to
      efficacy and tolerability with other possible regimens that may utilized such as 
      carboplatin-gemcitabine [20] or eribulin [21]. The longer as well as comparable
      TTP at cross over for both agents compared to that upfront suggests there may be 
      enrichment at cross over of a group of patients who are not only fit for further 
      treatment but are more likely to a derive continued benefit from additional
      treatment.

TI  - Comparison of the diagnostic value of FDG-PET/CT and axillary ultrasound for the 
      detection of lymph node metastases in breast cancer patients.
PG  - 1092-8
LID - 10.1258/ar.2012.110635 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: FDG-PET/CT is increasingly being used for breast cancer staging. Its 
      diagnostic accuracy in comparison to ultrasound as the standard non-invasive
      imaging modality for the evaluation of axillary lymph nodes has yet not been
      evaluated. PURPOSE: To retrospectively compare the diagnostic value of full-dose,
      intravenously contrast-enhanced FDG-PET/CT and ultrasound for the detection of
      lymph node metastases in breast cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety
      patients (one patient with a bilateral carcinoma) (89 women, one man; mean age,
      55.5 +/- 16.6 years) suffering from primary breast cancer underwent whole-body
      FDG-PET/CT and axillary ultrasound. The ipsilateral axillary fossa (n = 91) was
      evaluated for metastatic spread. The sensitivity, specificity, the positive
      predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of both
      methods were calculated. The sensitivity and accuracy were statistically compared
      using the McNemar Test (P <0.05). Analyses were made on a patient basis. The
      number of patients with extra-axillary locoregional lymph node metastases
      exclusively detected by FDG-PET/CT was evaluated. For axillary lymph node
      metastases histopathology served as the reference standard. RESULTS: The
      sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of FDG-PET/CT for the detection 
      of axillary lymph node metastases were 54%, 89%, 77%, 74%, and 75%, respectively.
      For ultrasound it was 38%, 78%, 54%, 65%, and 62%, respectively. FDG-PET/CT was
      significantly more accurate than ultrasound for the detection of axillary lymph
      node metastases (P = 0.019). There was no statistically significant difference
      between the sensitivity of both modalities (P = 0.0578). FDG-PET/CT detected
      extra-axillary locoregional lymph node metastases in seven patients (8%) that had
      not been detected by another imaging modality. CONCLUSION: Though more accurate
      compared to ultrasound for evaluating the axillary lymph node status FDG-PET/CT
      is only as sensitive as ultrasound when it comes to the detection of axillary
      lymph node metastases. Due to the low sensitivity FDG-PET/CT cannot act as a
      substitute for Sentinel lymph node biopsy. FDG-PET/CT is able to detect
      previously unknown locoregional extra-axillary lymph node metastases.

TI  - Genome-wide activation of latent donor splice sites in stress and disease.
PG  - 10980-94
LID - 10.1093/nar/gks834 [doi]
AB  - Sequences that conform to the 5' splice site (5'SS) consensus are highly abundant
      in mammalian introns. Most of these sequences are preceded by at least one
      in-frame stop codon; thus, their use for splicing would result in pre-maturely
      terminated aberrant mRNAs. In normally grown cells, such intronic 5'SSs appear
      not to be selected for splicing. However, under heat shock conditions aberrant
      splicing involving such latent 5'SSs occurred in a number of specific gene
      transcripts. Using a splicing-sensitive microarray, we show here that
      stress-induced (e.g. heat shock) activation of latent splicing is widespread
      across the human transcriptome, thus highlighting the possibility that latent
      splicing may underlie certain diseases. Consistent with this notion, our analyses
      of data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) revealed widespread activation of 
      latent splicing in cells grown under hypoxia and in certain cancers such as
      breast cancer and gliomas. These changes were found in thousands of transcripts
      representing a wide variety of functional groups; among them are genes involved
      in cell proliferation and differentiation. The GEO analysis also revealed a set
      of gene transcripts in oligodendroglioma, in which the level of activation of
      latent splicing increased with the severity of the disease.

TI  - FGFR genetic alterations predict for sensitivity to NVP-BGJ398, a selective
      pan-FGFR inhibitor.
PG  - 1118-33
LID - 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-12-0210 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Patient stratification biomarkers that enable the translation of
      cancer genetic knowledge into clinical use are essential for the successful and
      rapid development of emerging targeted anticancer therapeutics. Here, we describe
      the identification of patient stratification biomarkers for NVP-BGJ398, a novel
      and selective fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor. By intersecting
      genome-wide gene expression and genomic alteration data with cell
      line-sensitivity data across an annotated collection of cancer cell lines called 
      the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, we show that genetic alterations for FGFR
      family members predict for sensitivity to NVP-BGJ398. For the first time, we
      report oncogenic FGFR1 amplification in osteosarcoma as a potential patient
      selection biomarker. Furthermore, we show that cancer cell lines harboring FGF19 
      copy number gain at the 11q13 amplicon are sensitive to NVP-BGJ398 only when
      concomitant expression of beta-klotho occurs. Thus, our findings provide the
      rationale for the clinical development of FGFR inhibitors in selected patients
      with cancer harboring tumors with the identified predictors of sensitivity.
      SIGNIFICANCE: The success of a personalized medicine approach using targeted
      therapies ultimately depends on being able to identify the patients who will
      benefit the most from any given drug. To this end, we have integrated the
      molecular profiles for more than 500 cancer cell lines with sensitivity data for 
      the novel anticancer drug NVP-BGJ398 and showed that FGFR genetic alterations are
      the most significant predictors for sensitivity. This work has ultimately
      endorsed the incorporation of specific patient selection biomakers in the
      clinical trials for NVP-BGJ398.

AB  - TGF-beta derived from bone fuels melanoma bone metastases by inducing tumor
      secretion of prometastatic factors that act on bone cells to change the skeletal 
      microenvironment. Halofuginone is a plant alkaloid derivative that blocks
      TGF-beta signaling with antiangiogenic and antiproliferative properties. Here, we
      show for the first time that halofuginone therapy decreases development and
      progression of bone metastasis caused by melanoma cells through the inhibition of
      TGF-beta signaling. Halofuginone treatment of human melanoma cells inhibited cell
      proliferation, phosphorylation of SMAD proteins in response to TGF-beta, and
      TGF-beta-induced SMAD-driven transcription. In addition, halofuginone reduced
      expression of TGF-beta target genes that enhance bone metastases, including
      PTHrP, CTGF, CXCR4, and IL11. Also, cell apoptosis was increased in response to
      halofuginone. In nude mice inoculated with 1205 Lu melanoma cells, a preventive
      protocol with halofuginone inhibited bone metastasis. The beneficial effects of
      halofuginone treatment were comparable with those observed with other
      anti-TGF-beta strategies, including systemic administration of SD208, a
      small-molecule inhibitor of TGF-beta receptor I kinase, or forced overexpression 
      of Smad7, a negative regulator of TGF-beta signaling. Furthermore, mice with
      established bone metastases treated with halofuginone had significantly less
      osteolysis than mice receiving placebo assessed by radiography. Thus,
      halofuginone is also effective in reducing the progression of melanoma bone
      metastases. Moreover, halofuginone treatment reduced melanoma metastasis to the
      brain, showing the potential of this novel treatment against cancer metastasis.

TI  - Induction of the stem-like cell regulator CD44 by Rho kinase inhibition
      contributes to the maintenance of colon cancer-initiating cells.
PG  - 5101-10
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-3812 [doi]
AB  - The difficulty in expanding cancer-initiating cells in vitro is one of major
      obstacles for their biochemical characterization. We found that Rho kinase (ROCK)
      inhibitors as well as blebbistatin, a myosin II inhibitor, greatly facilitated
      the establishment of spheroids from primary colon cancer. The spheroid cells
      expressed cancer stem cell markers, showed the ability to differentiate, and
      induced tumors in mice. The spheroids were composed of cells that express various
      levels of CD44, whereas CD44(high) cells were associated with increased
      sphere-forming ability, expression of the activating form of beta-catenin, and
      elevated levels of glycolytic genes, CD44(-/low) cells showed increased levels of
      differentiation markers and apoptotic cells. The spheroid cells expressed variant
      forms of CD44 including v6, and the induction of the variants was associated with
      the activating phosphorylation of c-Met. As expected from the predicted
      hierarchy, CD44(high) cells differentiated into CD44(-/low) cells. Unexpectedly, 
      a fraction of CD44(-/low) cells generated CD44(high) cells, and the ROCK
      inhibitor or blebbistatin primed the transition by inducing CD44 expression. We
      propose that the transition from CD44(-/low) to CD44(high) state helps to
      maintain a CD44(high) fraction and the tumorigenic diversity in colon cancer.

PG  - 4883-9

AB  - The evolution of the cancer cell into a metastatic entity is the major cause of
      death in patients with cancer. Activation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
      transition (EMT) endows invasive and metastatic properties upon cancer cells that
      favor successful colonization of distal target organs. The observation that in
      many cancers distant metastases resemble the epithelial phenotype of primary
      tumors has led to speculation that the disseminated tumor cells recruited to the 
      target organs undergo mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). However, the
      MET cascade has not been recapitulated in vivo, and the cellular and molecular
      regulators that promote MET remain unknown. In a recent report, using a model of 
      spontaneous breast cancer, we have shown that bone marrow-derived myeloid
      progenitor cells in the premetastatic lung secrete the proteoglycan versican,
      which induces MET of metastatic tumor cells and accelerates metastases. This
      review summarizes recent progress in MET research, outlines a unique paracrine
      cross-talk between the microenvironment and the cancer cells, which promotes
      tumor outgrowth in the metastatic organ, and discusses opportunities for novel
      antimetastatic approaches for cancer therapy.

PG  - 4875-82
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-2217 [doi]
AB  - Recent technologic advances have permitted higher resolution and more rapid
      analysis of individual cancer genomes at the single-nucleotide level. Such
      advances have shown bewildering intertumor heterogeneity with limited somatic
      alterations shared between tumors of the same histopathologic subtype.
      Exacerbating such complexity, increasing evidence of intratumor genetic
      heterogeneity (ITH) is emerging, both within individual tumor biopsies and
      spatially separated between biopsies of the same tumor. Sequential analysis of
      tumors has also revealed evidence that ITH temporally evolves during the disease 
      course. ITH has implications for predictive or prognostic biomarker strategies,
      where the tumor subclone that may ultimately influence therapeutic outcome may
      evade detection because of its absence or presence at low frequency at diagnosis 
      or because of its regional separation from the tumor biopsy site. In this review,
      the implications of "trunk and branch" tumor evolution for drug discovery
      approaches and emerging evidence that low-frequency somatic events may drive
      tumor growth through paracrine signaling fostering a tumor ecologic niche are
      discussed. The concept of an "actionable mutation" is considered within a model
      of clonal dominance and heterogeneous tumor cell dependencies. Evidence that
      cancer therapeutics may augment ITH and the need to track the tumor subclonal
      architecture through treatment are defined as key research areas. Finally, if
      combination therapeutic approaches to limit the consequences of ITH prove
      challenging, identification of drivers or suppressors of ITH may provide
      attractive therapeutic targets to limit tumor evolutionary rates and adaptation.

TI  - Adenylate kinase-4 is a marker of poor clinical outcomes that promotes metastasis
      of lung cancer by downregulating the transcription factor ATF3.
PG  - 5119-29
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1842 [doi]
AB  - Biomarkers predicting metastatic capacity might assist the development of better 
      therapeutic strategies for aggressive cancers such as lung cancer. In this study,
      we show that adenylate kinase-4 (AK4) is a progression-associated gene in human
      lung cancer that promotes metastasis. Analysis of published microarray data
      showed that AK4 was upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma compared with normal
      cells. High AK4 expression was associated with advanced stage, disease recurrence
      and poor prognosis. Loss of AK4 expression suppressed the invasive potential of
      lung cancer cell lines, whereas AK4 overexpression promoted invasion in vitro and
      in vivo. Mechanistically, the transcription factor ATF3 was identified as a
      pivotal regulatory target of AK4. Simultaneous reduction in AK4 and ATF3
      expression abolished the inhibitory effects of ATF3 on invasion. ATF3
      overexpression in AK4-overexpressing cells limits invasion activity. Furthermore,
      patients with high AK4 and low ATF3 expression showed unfavorable outcomes
      compared with patients with low AK4 and high ATF3 expression. Taken together, our
      findings indicated that AK4 promotes malignant progression and recurrence by
      promoting metastasis in an ATF3-dependent manner.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The international comparability of data from population-based cancer 
      registries depends strongly on the completeness of case ascertainment.
      Furthermore, Austrian observed incidence rates suggest that the completeness of
      case ascertainment differs between Austrian federal states. Completeness of case 
      ascertainment is to be investigated on national and regional level. METHODS: We
      used the flow method to evaluate the completeness of the Austrian National Cancer
      Registry. This method is based on the logical flow of data in the registration
      system, and on the time distribution of various probabilities inherent in this
      flow. RESULTS: Overall completeness of the Austrian cancer incidence data 2005
      was 94.2% after a registration period of 5 years. The flow method found striking 
      differences in completeness between the federal states, which are contrary to the
      time series analyses. CONCLUSION: Overall completeness of the Austrian National
      Cancer Registry is in concordance with estimates from international registries.
      The biggest part of the decrease of incidence rates in the past 2 published years
      seems to be a result of incompleteness. The importance of the registration date
      of a cancer case and the survival time on completeness estimation using the flow 
      method has become apparent. Further investigation into the comparability of
      registration date between the federal states and into the quality of survival
      time estimates is recommended.

TI  - Matrine, a novel autophagy inhibitor, blocks trafficking and the proteolytic
      activation of lysosomal proteases.
PG  - 128-38
LID - 10.1093/carcin/bgs295 [doi]
AB  - Autophagy has been referred to as a double-edged sword in tumorigenesis and tumor
      progression. Emerging evidence suggests that pharmacological modulation of
      autophagy is a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer. However, few
      autophagy-modulating compounds are currently approved for clinical use in humans.
      Matrine is a natural compound extracted from traditional Chinese medicine that is
      widely used for treatment of a variety of diseases without any obvious side
      effects. Recently, matrine has been reported to induce autophagy and autophagic
      cell death in cancer cells, although the underlying mechanisms have yet to be
      elucidated. Here, we systematically examined the autophagic events induced by
      matrine in SGC7901 cells. The accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in
      matrine-treated cells was verified by the conversion of microtubule-associated
      protein light chain 3 as well as confocal and transmission electron microscopy.
      Furthermore, we demonstrated that matrine blocked autophagic degradation by
      impairing the activities of lysosomal proteases. Moreover, confocal microscopy
      and gradient ultracentrifugation revealed that the trafficking processes and
      proteolytic activation of cathepsins were inhibited by matrine. Using a pH sensor
      probe, we found elevated pH values in endosomes/lysosomes in response to matrine 
      treatment. Therefore, matrine seems to be a novel autophagy inhibitor that can
      modulate the maturation process of lysosomal proteases.

TI  - IkappaBKbeta and NFkappaB1, NSAID use and risk of colorectal cancer in the Colon 
      Cancer Family Registry.
PG  - 79-85
LID - 10.1093/carcin/bgs296 [doi]
AB  - The NFkappaB-signaling pathway regulates cell proliferation and inflammation.
      Activation of the pathway is implicated in the etiology of colorectal cancer
      (CRC). NSAIDs may reduce CRC risk partially through a nuclear factor-kappa B
      (NFkappaB)-dependent pathway. In this study, we investigated associations between
      34 NFkappaB1 and 8 IkappaBKbeta tagSNPs and CRC risk and examined interactions
      with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. Using conditional logistic
      regression, we investigated these associations among 1584 incident CRC cases and 
      2516 sibling controls from the Colon Cancer Family Registry. Three IkappaBKbeta
      SNPs were associated with a statistically significant lower colorectal or colon
      cancer risk: rs9694958 (A>G intron 5) (colorectal: OR(hzv) = 0.26(0.07-0.99),
      P(trend) = 0.048, P(adj) = 0.25), rs10958713 (A>C intron 19) (colon: OR(hzv) =
      0.62(0.42-0.92), P(trend) = 0.005, P(adj) = 0.03) and rs5029748 (C>A intron 2)
      (colon: OR(het) = 0.72(0.56-0.91), P(trend) = 0.01, P(adj) = 0.08). We replicated
      trends associated with NFkappaB1 and IkappaBKbeta variants identified in a
      previous study (rs4648110 (T>A intron 22), rs13117745 (G>A intron 5) and
      rs3747811 (T>A intron 1)). IkappaBKbeta's rs6474387 (C>T intron 20) and
      rs11986055 (A>C intron 2) showed substantially lower colon cancer risk among
      current NSAID users (P(interaction) = 0.01 and P(interaction) = 0.045,
      respectively), whereas NFkappaB1's rs230490 (G>A 5' (outside UTR)) and rs997476
      (C>A 3' (outside UTR)) showed higher CRC risk among current NSAID users
      (P(interaction) = 0.01 and P(interaction) = 0.03, respectively). These findings
      suggest that variants in NFkappaB1 and IkappaBKbeta are associated with CRC risk 
      and NSAIDs may function partially through an NFkappaB-dependent pathway. The SNPs
      identified here should be considered for future functional studies and may be
      useful in designing a pharmacogenetic approach to preventive NSAID use.

TI  - Quality of evidence must guide risk assessment of asbestos.
PG  - 879-87
LID - 10.1093/annhyg/mes065 [doi]
AB  - In 2011, we reported on the sensitivity of lung cancer potency estimates for
      asbestos to the quality of the exposure assessment component of underlying
      evidence. Both this meta-analysis and a separate reassessment of standards
      published by the Health Council of the Netherlands (Gezondheidsraad) have been
      commented on by Berman and Case. A criticism is that we used a truncated data
      set. We incrementally excluded poorer-quality studies to evaluate trends in
      meta-analyzed lung cancer potency estimates (meta-K (L) values). This was one of 
      three analysis approaches we presented. The other two used the full set of
      studies: a meta-analysis stratified by covariates and dichotomized by poorer and 
      better exposure assessment aspects; and a meta-regression modeling both asbestos 
      fiber type and these covariates. They also state that our results are not robust 
      to removal of one study. We disagree with this claim and present additional
      sensitivity analyses underpinning our earlier conclusion that inclusion of
      studies with higher-quality asbestos-exposure assessment yield higher
      meta-estimates of the lung cancer risk per unit of exposure. We reiterate that
      potency differences for predominantly chrysotile- versus
      amphibole-asbestos-exposed cohorts are difficult to ascertain when meta-analyses 
      are restricted to studies with fewer exposure assessment limitations. We strongly
      argue that the existence of any uncertainty related to potency issues should not 
      hamper the development of appropriate evidence-based guidelines and stringent
      policies in order to protect the public from hazardous environmental and
      occupational exposures.

TI  - Risk factors for local and regional recurrence in patients with resected N0-N1
      non-small-cell lung cancer, with implications for patient selection for adjuvant 
      radiation therapy.
PG  - 67-74
LID - 10.1093/annonc/mds274 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the actuarial risk of local
      and regional failure in patients with completely resected non-small-cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC), and to assess surgical and pathological factors affecting this
      risk. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1998 and December 2009, 1402
      consecutive stage I-III (N0-N1) NSCLC patients underwent complete resection
      without adjuvant radiation therapy. The median follow-up was 42 months. RESULTS: 
      Local-regional recurrence was identified in 9% of patients, with local failure
      alone in 3% of patients, regional failure alone in 4% of patients, and both local
      and regional failure simultaneously in 2% of patients. Patients who had local
      failure were found to be at increased risk of mortality. By multivariate
      analyses, three variables were shown to be independently significant risk factors
      for local [surgical procedure (single/multiple wedges+segmentectomy versus
      lobectomy+bilobectomy+pneumonectomy), tumor size>2.7 cm, and visceral pleural
      invasion] and regional (pathologic N1 stage, visceral pleural invasion, and
      lymphovascular space invasion, LVI) recurrence, respectively. CONCLUSION:
      Patients with N0-N1 disease have low rates of locoregional recurrence after
      surgical resection. However, several prognostic factors can be identified that
      increase this risk and identify patients who may benefit from adjuvant treatment.

TI  - Discordance in receptor status between primary and recurrent breast cancer has a 
      prognostic impact: a single-institution analysis.
PG  - 101-8
LID - 10.1093/annonc/mds248 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumor phenotype may change during breast cancer progression. This
      study evaluates the prognostic impact of receptor discordance between paired
      primaries and recurrences. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and thirty-nine
      patients underwent histological sampling of suspected breast cancer recurrence.
      All the pathology assessments [ER, PgR and human epidermal growth factor receptor
      2 (HER2)] on both primaries and confirmed recurrences were performed at the same 
      laboratory. RESULTS: A breast cancer recurrence was confirmed in 119 cases. Rates
      of discordance were 13.4%, 39% and 11.8% for ER, PgR and HER2, respectively.
      Ninety-two patients maintained the same tumor phenotype [i.e. the same hormone
      receptors (HR) and HER2 status], whereas 27 (22.7%) changed during progression.
      The loss of HR positivity and the loss of HER2 positivity resulted in a worse
      post-recurrence survival (P=0.01 and P=0.008, respectively) and overall survival 
      (OS; P=0.06 and P=0.0002, respectively), compared with the corresponding
      concordant-positive cases. Tumor phenotype discordance was associated with worse 
      post-recurrence and OS (P=0.006 and P=0.002, respectively); those cases who
      turned into triple-negative experienced the poorest outcome, respect to the
      concordant group (P=0.001, OS). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated for the first time
      an impact on OS of phenotype discordance between primary breast cancer and
      relapse. Among discordant cases, receptor loss resulted in the main determinant
      of poorer outcome.

TI  - A randomized phase II study evaluating the combination of carboplatin-based
      chemotherapy with pertuzumab versus carboplatin-based therapy alone in patients
      with relapsed, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.
PG  - 145-52
LID - 10.1093/annonc/mds282 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pertuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting human epidermal
      growth factor receptor (HER)-mediated signalling, has shown activity in ovarian
      cancer in preclinical models and in the clinic. This randomized phase II study
      evaluated efficacy and safety of pertuzumab in combination with carboplatin-based
      chemotherapy in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent advanced ovarian
      cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive six cycles of
      chemotherapy (carboplatin and either paclitaxel (Taxol) or gemcitabine) with or
      without pertuzumab. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) as 
      determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and/or by CA 125
      measurements. Secondary end points evaluated the response rate, safety profile,
      duration of response, time to progression and overall survival for both treatment
      arms. RESULTS: A total of 149 patients received either chemotherapy with
      pertuzumab (arm A, n=74) or chemotherapy alone (arm B, n=75). There was no
      significant difference either in median PFS or in the secondary end points
      between the two arms. No differences were seen in an exploratory biomarker
      analysis of HER3 mRNA expression between the two arms. Pertuzumab was well
      tolerated, with no increase in cardiac adverse events compared with chemotherapy 
      alone. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of pertuzumab to carboplatin-based chemotherapy 
      did not substantially prolong PFS in unselected patients with platinum-sensitive 
      ovarian cancer.

TI  - Diagnostic and prognostic impact of desmocollins in human lung cancer.
PG  - 1100-6
LID - 10.1136/jclinpath-2011-200630 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Desmosomes are intercellular junctions that confer strong cell-cell
      adhesion. Two main members of desmosomal cadherins, desmogleins (DSGs) and
      desmocollins (DSCs), are involved in carcinogenesis. However, their role in human
      lung cancer remained elusive. The aims of this study were to analyse the
      expression of DSCs and to evaluate their clinical application in lung cancer.
      METHODS: The expression of DSC1-3 mRNAs was analysed by RT-PCR. The methylation
      status of DSCs was analysed by demethylation tests and bisulphite sequencing.
      Protein expression of DSCs in primary lung cancer was evaluated by
      immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. RESULTS: DSC1-3 mRNAs were
      downregulated in lung cancer cells, and the expression was restored in four out
      of seven cell lines, respectively, after 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment. A
      heterogeneous methylation pattern was detected by bisulphite sequencing in exon 1
      of DSC2 and DSC3. In 199 patients with primary lung cancer, we found that lower
      protein expression of DSC1 was significantly linked to worse tumour
      differentiation (p=0.017), DSC3 proteins were more expressed in squamous cell
      carcinoma (SCC) compared with adenocarcinoma (ADC) (p<0.001), and reduced
      expression of DSC1 and DSC3 was significantly correlated with poor clinical
      outcome (p=0.045 and p=0.007, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that
      downregulation of DSC1-3 may be explained by DNA methylation, DSC1 may be a
      marker for tumour differentiation, DSC3 has a potential diagnostic value in
      subclassification of non-small cell lung carcinoma into SCC and ADC, and
      furthermore, DSC1 and DSC3 may be prognostic markers for lung cancer.

TI  - Emerging roles of the ribonucleotide reductase M2 in colorectal cancer and
      ultraviolet-induced DNA damage repair.
PG  - 4704-13
AB  - AIM: To investigate the roles of the ribonucleotide reductase M2 (RRM2) subunit
      in colorectal cancer (CRC) and ultraviolet (UV)-induced DNA damage repair.
      METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarray was performed to
      detect the expression of RRM2. Seven CRC cell lines were cultured and three human
      colon cancer cell lines, i.e., HCT116, SW480 and SW620, were used. Reverse
      transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were performed to
      determine the mRNA and protein expression levels of RRM2, respectively. Cell
      proliferation assay, cell cycle analysis were performed. Cell apoptosis was
      evaluated by double staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Annexin V
      and propidium iodide (PI) using Annexin V/PI apoptosis kit. The motility and
      invasion of CRC cells were assessed by the Transwell chamber assay. Cells were
      irradiated with a 254 nm UV-C lamp to detect the UV sensitivity after RRM2
      depletion. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining revealed elevated RRM2 levels in
      CRC tissues. RRM2 overexpression was positively correlated with invasion depth (P
      < 0.05), poorly differentiated type (P = 0.0051), and tumor node metastasis stage
      (P = 0.0015). The expression of RRM2 in HCT116 cells was downregulated after
      transfection, and HCT116 cell proliferation was obviously suppressed compared to 
      control groups (P < 0.05). In the invasion test, the number of cells that passed 
      through the chambers in the RRM2-siRNA group was 81 +/- 3, which was lower than
      that in the negative control (289 +/- 7) and blank control groups (301 +/- 7.2). 
      These differences were statistically significant (P < 0.01). Our data suggest
      that RRM2 overexpression may be associated with CRC progression. RRM2 silencing
      by siRNA may inhibit the hyperplasia and invasiveness of CRC cells, suggesting
      that RRM2 may play an important role in the infiltration and metastasis of CRC,
      which is a potential therapeutic strategy in CRC. In addition, RRM2 depletion
      increased UV sensitivity. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that RRM2 may be a
      facilitating factor in colorectal tumorigenesis and UV-induced DNA damage repair.

TI  - "Extended" radical cholecystectomy for gallbladder cancer: long-term outcomes,
      indications and limitations.
PG  - 4736-43
AB  - AIM: To delineate indications and limitations for "extended" radical
      cholecystectomy for gallbladder cancer: a procedure which was instituted in our
      department in 1982. METHODS: Of 145 patients who underwent a radical resection
      for gallbladder cancer from 1982 through 2006, 52 (36%) had an extended radical
      cholecystectomy, which involved en bloc resection of the gallbladder, gallbladder
      fossa, extrahepatic bile duct, and the regional lymph nodes (first- and
      second-echelon node groups). A retrospective analysis of the 52 patients was
      conducted including at least 5 years of follow up. Residual tumor status was
      judged as no residual tumor (R0) or microscopic/macroscopic residual tumor
      (R1-2). Pathological findings were documented according to the American Joint
      Committee on Cancer Cancer Staging Manual (7th edition). RESULTS: The primary
      tumor was classified as pathological T1 (pT1) in 3 patients, pT2 in 36, pT3 in
      12, and pT4 in 1. Twenty-three patients had lymph node metastases; 11 had a
      single positive node, 4 had two positive nodes, and 8 had three or more positive 
      nodes. None of the three patients with pT1 tumors had nodal disease, whereas 23
      of 49 (47%) with pT2 or more advanced tumors had nodal disease. One patient died 
      during the hospital stay for definitive resection, giving an in-hospital
      mortality rate of 2%. Overall survival (OS) after extended radical
      cholecystectomy was 65% at 5 years and 53% at 10 years in all 52 patients. OS
      differed according to the pT classification (P < 0.001) and the nodal status (P =
      0.010). All of 3 patients with pT1 tumors and most (29 of 36) patients with pT2
      tumors survived for more than 5 years. Of 12 patients with pT3 tumors, 8 who had 
      an R1-2 resection, distant metastasis, or extensive extrahepatic organ
      involvement died soon after resection. Of the remaining four pT3 patients who had
      localized hepatic spread through the gallbladder fossa and underwent an R0
      resection, 2 survived for more than 5 years and another survived for 4 years and 
      2 mo. The only patient with pT4 tumor died of disease soon after resection. Among
      23 node-positive patients, 11 survived for more than 5 years, and of these, 10
      had a modest degree of nodal disease (one or two positive nodes). CONCLUSION:
      Extended radical cholecystectomy is indicated for pT2 tumors and some pT3 tumors 
      with localized hepatic invasion, provided that the regional nodal disease is
      limited to a modest degree (up to two positive nodes). Extensive pT3 disease, pT4
      disease, or marked nodal disease appears to be beyond the scope of this radical
      procedure.

TI  - Clinicopathologic significance of expression of nuclear factor-kappaB RelA and
      its target gene products in gastric cancer patients.
PG  - 4744-50
AB  - AIM: To assess the prognostic significance of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)
      and its target genes in gastric cancer. METHODS: The tumor tissues of 115
      patients with gastric cancer were immunohistochemically evaluated using
      monoclonal antibodies against NF-kappaB RelA. Preoperative serum levels of
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) were assessed via
      enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay. C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A 
      (SAA) were measured via immunotrubidimetry. RESULTS: Positive rate of NF-kappaB
      RelA was 42.6%. NF-kappaB RelA expression in tumor tissues was also related to
      serum levels of IL-6 (P = 0.044) and CRP (P = 0.010). IL-6, SAA, CRP were related
      to depth of invasion, VEGF and SAA were correlated with lymph node metastasis.
      IL-6, VEGF, SAA and CRP were related to the stage. Univariate analysis
      demonstrated that immunostaining of NF-kappaB RelA, levels of IL-6, VEGF, SAA
      were significantly related with both disease free survival and overall survival
      (OS). Multivariate analysis verified that NF-kappaB RelA [hazard ratio (HR):
      3.40, P = 0.024] and SAA (HR: 3.39, P = 0.045) were independently associated with
      OS. CONCLUSION: Increased expression of NF-kappaB RelA and high levels of serum
      SAA were associated with poor OS in gastric cancer patients.

      cytokeratin (CK) 19 immunostain (CK19(-) HCC and CK19(+) HCC). CK19 positivity
      was defined as membranous and/or cytoplasmic expression in >/= 5% of tumor cells 
      with moderate or strong intensity. Patients with other primary liver cancers,
      such as combined HCC and cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC), intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) who received curative liver resection, were also
      included in the study. Clinical characteristics of CK19(-) HCC and CK19(+) HCC
      patients, including survival outcome after curative liver resection, were
      compared with that of cHCC-CC and ICC patients. RESULTS: The overall survival
      (OS) rate of CK19(-) HCC (n = 49) after the curative surgical treatment was
      90.7%, and 80.4% at 1 and 5 years after the resection. OS rate of CK19(+) HCC (n 
      = 21) was 74.3%, 28.9% and OS rate of cHCC-CC (n = 22) was 66.7%, 32.2% at 1 and 
      5 years after the surgery. For ICC (n = 19), 1 and 5-year-OS rate was 50.2% and
      14.3% after the curative resection. The OS rates of CK19(+) HCC and cHCC-CC were 
      significantly lower than that of CK19(-) HCC, but higher than the OS rate of ICC 
      (P = 0.000). There was no statistically significant difference in OS rate between
      CK19(+) HCC and cHCC-CC. The disease free survival (DFS) rate of CK19(-) HCC was 
      72.0% and 54.5% at 1 and 3 years after the surgical treatment. DFS rate of
      CK19(+) HCC was 53.3%, 34.3% and DFS rate of cHCC-CC was 51.5%, 39.2% at 1 and 3 
      years after the resection. For ICC, 1 and 3-year-DFS rate was 28.0% and 14.0%
      after the curative resection. DFS rate of CK19(-) HCC was significantly higher
      than that of ICC (P = 0.017), but marginally higher than DFS rate of either
      CK19(+) HCC or cHCC-CC (P = 0.097, P = 0.089, respectively). Predictors of
      outcome after the surgery of primary liver cancer were pathology of the resected 
      mass, existence of microvascular invasion and accompanying satellite nodule.
      CONCLUSION: Primary liver cancers with biliary components tended to show poorer
      surgical outcome. This suggested that immuno-phenotype of liver cancers was as
      important as their morphological classification.

TI  - Biliary cysts: etiology, diagnosis and management.
PG  - 4801-10
AB  - Biliary cysts (BC) are rare dilatations of different parts of a biliary tract.
      They account for approximately 1% of all benign biliary diseases. BC occur the
      most frequently in Asian and female populations. They are an important problem
      for pediatricians, gastroenterologists, radiologists and surgeons. Clinical
      presentation and management depend on the BC type. Cholangiocarcinoma is the most
      serious and dangerous BC complication. The other complications associated with BC
      involve cholelithiasis and hepatolithiasis, cholangitis, acute and chronic
      pancreatitis, portal hypertension, liver fibrosis and secondary liver cirrhosis
      and spontaneous cyst perforation. Different BC classifications have been
      described in the literature. Todani classification dividing BC into five types is
      the most useful in clinical practice. The early diagnosis and proper treatment
      are very important, because BC are associated with a risk of carcinogenesis. A
      malignancy risk increases with the age. Radiological investigations
      (ultrasonography, computed tomography, endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) play an
      important role in BC diagnostics. Currently, prenatal diagnosis using
      ultrasonography is possible. It allows to differentiate biliary disorders in
      fetals and to perform the early surgical treatment that improves results. In most
      patients, total cyst excision with Roux-Y hepaticojejunostomy is the treatment of
      choice. Surgical treatment of BC is associated with high success rate and low
      morbidity and mortality. The early treatment is associated with a lower number of
      complications. Patients following BC surgery require permanent and careful
      postoperative observation using laboratory and imaging investigations because of 
      possibility of biliary anastomosis stricture and biliary cancer in tissue
      remnant.

TI  - Inducible nitric oxide synthetase genotype and Helicobacter pylori infection
      affect gastric cancer risk.
PG  - 4917-24
AB  - AIM: To investigate the association of the inducible nitric oxide synthetase
      (iNOS) C150T polymorphism with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and
      gastric cancer (GC) risk in Iran. METHODS: In order to determine whether there
      was a correlation between iNOS genotype and GC in Iran, we conducted a
      case-control study using samples from 329 individuals. For each sample, the C150T
      iNOS polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
      restriction digestion. Patients were grouped by cancer presence, demographic and 
      behavior characteristics, and H. pylori infection status. Statistical tests were 
      conducted to determine whether any behavioral factors or a particular iNOS
      genotype was associated with GC in the study population. RESULTS: In this
      population, we found that smoking, hot beverage consumption, a familial history
      of GC and H. pylori infection status were significantly associated with GC
      development (P = 0.015, P < 0.001, P = 0.0034, and P < 0.015, respectively). The 
      distribution of the C150T iNOS genotypes among the two study groups was not
      statistically significant alone, but was impacted by H. pylori infection status. 
      When compared to the non-H. pylori infected group, cancer patients who had a
      heterozygous CT genotype and were also infected with H. pylori were 2.1 times
      more at risk of developing GC [odds ratio (OR) = 2.1, P = 0.03] while those with 
      a homozygous TT genotype and infected with H. pylori were 5.0 times more at risk 
      of developing GC (OR = 5.0, P = 0.029). In contrast, this association was not
      seen in patients in the control group. CONCLUSION: A CT or TT polymorphism at
      position 150 in the iNOS gene significantly increases the risk of GC and may be a
      marker for GC susceptibility.

TI  - Endothelial precursor cells promote angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 4925-33
AB  - AIM: To investigate the role of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells 
      (EPCs) in the angiogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: The bone
      marrow of HCC mice was reconstructed by transplanting green fluorescent protein
      (GFP) + bone marrow cells. The concentration of circulating EPCs was determined
      by colony-forming assays and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Serum and
      tissue levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and colony-stimulating
      factor (CSF) were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The
      distribution of EPCs in tumor and tumor-free tissues was detected by
      immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The incorporation
      of EPCs into hepatic vessels was examined by immunofluorescence and
      immunohistochemistry. The proportion of EPCs in vessels was then calculated.
      RESULTS: The HCC model was successful established. The flow cytometry analysis
      showed the mean percentage of CD133CD34 and CD133VEGFR2 double positive cells in 
      HCC mice was 0.45% +/- 0.16% and 0.20% +/- 0.09% respectively. These values are
      much higher than in the sham-operation group (0.11% +/- 0.13%, 0.05% +/- 0.11%, n
      = 9) at 14 d after modeling. At 21 d, the mean percentage of circulating
      CD133CD34 and CD133VEGFR2 cells is 0.23% +/- 0.19%, 0.25% +/- 0.15% in HCC model 
      vs 0.05% +/- 0.04%, 0.12% +/- 0.11% in control. Compared to the transient
      increase observed in controls, the higher level of circulating EPCs were induced 
      by HCC. In addition, the level of serum VEGF and CSF increased gradually in HCC, 
      reaching its peak 14 d after modeling, then slowly decreased. Consecutive
      sections stained for the CD133 and CD34 antigens showed that the CD133+ and CD34+
      VEGFR2 cells were mostly recruited to HCC tissue and concentrated in tumor
      microvessels. Under fluorescence microscopy, the bone-marrow (BM)-derived cells
      labeled with GFP were concentrated in the same area. The relative levels of CD133
      and CD34 gene expression were elevated in tumors, around 5.0 and 3.8 times that
      of the tumor free area. In frozen liver sections from HCC mice, cells
      co-expressing CD133 and VEGFR2 were identified by immunohistochemical staining
      using anti-CD133 and VEGFR2 antibodies. In tumor tissue, the double-positive
      cells were incorporated into vessel walls. In immunofluorescent staining. These
      CD31 and GFP double positive cells are direct evidence that tumor vascular
      endothelial cells (VECs) come partly from BM-derived EPCs. The proportion of GFP 
      CD31 double positive VECs (out of all VECs) on day 21 was around 35.3% +/- 21.2%.
      This is much higher than the value recorded on day 7 group (17.1% +/- 8.9%). The 
      expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular adhesion molecule 1,
      and VEGF was higher in tumor areas than in tumor-free tissues. CONCLUSION:
      Mobilized EPCs were found to participate in tumor vasculogenesis of HCC.
      Inhibiting EPC mobilization or recruitment to tumor tissue may be an efficient
      strategy for treating HCC.

TI  - Does gemcitabine-based combination therapy improve the prognosis of unresectable 
      pancreatic cancer?
PG  - 4944-58
AB  - AIM: To assess whether gemcitabine-based combination therapy improves the
      prognosis of unresectable pancreatic cancer compared with gemcitabine treatment
      alone. METHODS: A quantitative up-to-date meta-analysis was undertaken to
      investigate the efficacy of gemcitabine-based combination treatment compared with
      gemcitabine monotherapy in locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.
      Inclusion was limited to high-quality randomized clinical trials. RESULTS:
      Twenty-six studies were included in the present analysis, with a total of 8808
      patients recruited. The studies were divided into four subgroups based on the
      different kinds of cytotoxic agents, including platinum, fluoropyrimidine,
      camptothecin and targeted agents. Patients treated with gemcitabine monotherapy
      had significantly lower objective response rate [risk ratio (RR), 0.72; 95%
      confidence interval (CI): 0.63-0.83; P < 0.001], and lower 1-year overall
      survival (RR, 0.90; 95%CI: 0.82-0.99; P = 0.04). Gemcitabine monotherapy caused
      fewer complications, including fewer grade 3-4 toxicities: including vomiting
      (RR, 0.75; 95%CI: 0.62-0.89; P = 0.001), diarrhea (RR, 0.66; 95%CI: 0.49-0.89; P 
      = 0.006), neutropenia (RR, 0.88; 95%CI: 0.72-1.06; P = 0.18), anemia (RR, 0.96;
      95%CI: 0.82-1.12; P = 0.60), and thrombocytopenia (RR, 0.76; 95%CI: 0.60-0.97; P 
      = 0.03) compared with gemcitabine combination therapies. CONCLUSION: Gemcitabine 
      combination therapy provides a modest improvement of survival, but is associated 
      with more toxicity compared with gemcitabine monotherapy.

TI  - Alfa-lipoic acid controls tumor growth and modulates hepatic redox state in
      Ehrlich-ascites-carcinoma-bearing mice.
PG  - 509838
AB  - The effect of oral supplementation of alpha-lipoic (LA) on growth of Ehrlich
      ascites carcinoma cells (EACs) and hepatic antioxidant state in mice was
      investigated. The results revealed that alpha-lipoic (LA) acid at 50 mg/kg body
      wt reduced the viability and volume of EAC cells and increased the survival of
      the treated animals. In addition, LA normalized oxidative stress in liver of
      mice-bearing EAC cells evidenced by increasing the levels of total thiols,
      glutathione, glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalyse. On
      the other hand, significant decreases in the levels of malondialdehyde and
      protein carbonyl were demonstrated in liver indicating controlled oxidative
      stress in these animals. As a consequence, LA regulated liver enzymes, alkaline
      phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and
      gamma-glutamyl transferase. The data also indicated the efficiency of LA as
      cancer inhibitor and therapeutic influence. In conclusion, the present data
      suggest LA as a potential therapeutic complement in the treatment or prevention
      of different pathologies that may be related to an imbalance of the cellular
      oxidoreductive status associated with malignancy.

AB  - Advanced laryngeal cancer sometimes necessitates the removal of the complete
      larynx. This procedure involves suturing the trachea to an opening in the neck,
      the most disturbing consequence of which is the loss of voice. Since 1859,
      several devices have been developed for voice restoration, based mainly on a
      vibrating reed element. However, the resulting sound is very monotonous and thus 
      unpleasant. Presently the most successful way of voice restoration is the
      placement of a one-way shunt valve in the tracheo-esophageal wall, thus
      preventing aspiration and allowing air to flow from the lungs to the esophagus,
      where soft tissues start to vibrate for substitute voicing. However, the quality 
      of this voice is often poor. New artificial vocal folds to be placed within the
      shunt valve have been developed, and a membrane-principle concept appears very
      promising, owing to the self-cleaning construction and the high voice quality.
      Future developments will include electronic voice sources. Hopefully these
      developments will result in a high-quality voice, after 150 years of research.

TI  - New insights into ovarian cancer pathology.
PG  - x111-7
AB  - Malignant epithelial tumors (carcinomas) are the most common ovarian cancers and 
      also the most lethal gynecological malignancies. Based on histopathology and
      molecular genetic alterations, ovarian carcinomas are divided into five main
      types [high-grade serous (70%), endometrioid (10%), clear-cell (10%), mucinous
      (3%), and low-grade serous carcinomas (<5%)] that account for over 95% of cases. 
      These types are essentially distinct diseases, as indicated by differences in
      epidemiological and genetic risk factors, precursor lesions, patterns of spread, 
      and molecular events during oncogenesis, response to chemotherapy, and prognosis.
      For a successful specific treatment, reproducible histopathological diagnosis of 
      the tumor cell type is critical. The five tumor types are morphologically diverse
      and resemble carcinomas of the uterus. Actually, recent investigations have
      demonstrated that a substantial number of cancers, traditionally thought to be
      primary ovarian tumors (particularly serous, endometrioid, and clear-cell
      carcinomas), originate in the fallopian tube and the endometrium and involve the 
      ovary secondarily. This presentation summarizes recent advances in the molecular 
      pathology which have greatly improved our understanding of the biology of ovarian
      carcinoma and are also relevant to patient management.

TI  - Optimal first-line treatment in ovarian cancer.
PG  - x118-27
AB  - Treatment of ovarian cancer remains challenging despite the high complete
      response rate seen after maximal surgical debulking surgery and
      platinum-combination chemotherapy. as most patients will relapse and eventually
      succumb to ovarian cancer, new strategies are urgently required to improve
      survival. a platinum-taxane combination has been the cornerstone of treatment for
      >15 years. Better use of these drugs is being explored through scheduling
      studies, and dose-dense or intraperitoneal (IP) therapies. Further improvements
      in treatment will most likely come from the integration of optimal chemotherapy
      with one or more of the hundreds of molecular-targeted agents that could be
      active in ovarian cancer. The greatest experience has been with anti-angiogenic
      agents. Two large phase III trials in first-line ovarian cancer have demonstrated
      a positive effect of bevacizumab when administered concurrently with chemotherapy
      and then as a maintenance treatment. In this review, we discuss the existing
      treatments for ovarian cancer and highlight areas of recent progress.

PG  - x135-8
AB  - Pancreatic cancer remains a devastating disease. Over the last few years, there
      have been important advances in the molecular and biological understanding of
      pancreatic cancer. This included understanding of the genomic complexity of the
      disease, the role of pancreatic cancer stem cells, the relevance of the tumor
      microenvironment, and the unique metabolic adaptation of pancreas cancer cells to
      obtain nutrients under hypoxic environment. In this paper, we review the most
      salient developments in these few areas.

TI  - Treatment of locoregional disease: adjuvant versus neoadjuvant.
PG  - x141-7
AB  - The efficacy of adjuvant therapy after the resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma
      has been demonstrated by several randomized studies. Postoperative treatment
      applied either as chemotherapy alone or in combination with chemoradiotherapy is 
      therefore considered a recommended standard in resectable pancreatic cancer (PC).
      Multiple arguments speak in favor of preoperative systemic therapy. Specifically,
      the conception of PC as a metastatic disease even at the early stage of apparent 
      resectability supports the strategy of upfront systemic therapy. Unfortunately,
      randomized studies comparing neoadjuvant with adjuvant regimens have not been
      performed, and the superiority of one strategy over the other still has to be
      confirmed. Future clinical research may even combine neoadjuvant and adjuvant
      treatment. New avenues of individualized treatment may also be reached by the
      inclusion of molecular parameters of the tumor and pharmacogenomic profiles of
      the patient into decision making.

TI  - Treatment choice for locally advanced head and neck cancers on the basis of risk 
      factors: biological risk factors.
PG  - x173-7
AB  - Patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma often
      experience relapse, the cause of poor survival statistics. Relapse occurs
      following the three main types of treatment, surgery with or without
      post-operative (chemo)radiotherapy, or chemoradiation (containing cisplatin).
      Cancer relapse can result from (i) outgrowth of residual tumour cells, sometimes 
      with a number too small to be detected by routine histopathology or (ii)
      development of another carcinoma in a field of pre-neoplastic cells that has
      remained after treatment of the primary carcinoma. At this moment, clinical
      staging is not enough to identify patients who will develop relapse and who need 
      tailored treatment. This review describes the latest knowledge of mechanisms of
      cancer relapse, addresses the biomarkers of potential interest detectable in the 
      tissue of the tumour or its surgical margins and discusses three biomarkers,
      human papillomavirus, TP53 and epidermal growth receptor in more detail. Once a
      marker panel has been established, treatment should be focussed on the patients
      at risk of relapse by improved tailoring of existing treatment modalities. Also, 
      the implementation of more targeting therapies based on the characteristics of
      the discovered markers should lead to better survival rates.

PG  - x189-92
AB  - Non-small-cell lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide
      with poor outcomes, even when a curative treatment approach is feasible.
      Chemotherapy remains a useful option for the majority of patients with advanced
      or relapsed disease as well as having a substantial role in the adjuvant setting.
      Identifying predictive biomarkers would enable us to better select those patients
      more likely to benefit from chemotherapy while avoiding toxic effects in those
      patients not deriving benefit from chemotherapy. although the use of biomarkers
      to select chemotherapy is not the standard approach, several potential biomarkers
      have been identified and a few prospective trials are ongoing. We review here the
      most-studied biomarkers for chemotherapy.

TI  - Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and derived treatments.
PG  - x193-6
AB  - Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors are used to treat advanced lung
      cancer patients for almost a decade. Current knowledge on their role in the first
      or subsequent lines of therapy serves as a model for other targeted therapies in 
      development. Several molecular predictors of outcomes were successfully
      identified in preclinical and clinical studies. Evaluation of EGFR-activating
      mutations is currently used to define biologically distinct patient subsets with 
      important consequences for prognosis and therapy. Ongoing translational and
      clinical research exploring EGFR inhibition in lung cancer focuses on better
      understanding of biology of EGFR-driven disease, efficacy of novel irreversible
      EGFR inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, efficacy of combination strategies,
      and attempts to move EGFR inhibitors into therapy portfolio for early-stage
      disease.

TI  - Going beyond EGFR.
PG  - x197-203
AB  - a substantial proportion of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and
      adenocarcinoma in particular, depends on a so-called 'driver mutation' for their 
      malignant phenotype. This genetic alteration induces and sustains tumorigenesis, 
      and targeting of its protein product can result in growth inhibition, tumor
      response and increased patient survival. NSCLC can thus be subdivided into
      clinically relevant molecular subsets. Mutations in EGFR best illustrate the
      therapeutic relevance of molecular classification. This article reviews the scope
      of presently known driving molecular alterations, including ROS1, BRAF, KRAS,
      HER2 and PIK3CA, with a special emphasis on aLK rearrangements, and outlines
      their potential therapeutic applications.

TI  - The current state of breast cancer classification.
PG  - x207-10
AB  - Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease due to its diverse morphological 
      features, the variable clinical outcome and the response to different therapeutic
      options. It is therefore necessary to devise a clinically meaningful
      classification of the disease, which has to be scientifically sound, clinically
      useful and widely reproducible. The established histopathological classification 
      has a limited clinical utility, due to insufficient prognostic and predictive
      power. More recent classification schemes, based on the immunohistochemical
      characterization of breast cancer for the assessment of hormone receptor status, 
      HER2 gene over-expression or amplification and the proliferative fraction or on
      gene expression profiles, correlate much better with the clinical outcome and may
      be used to inform the choice of the systemic therapy.

TI  - Genomic analyses to select patients for adjuvant chemotherapy: trials and
      tribulations.
PG  - x211-8
AB  - Despite improvements in adjuvant chemotherapy regimens in breast cancer,
      personalised use of specific cytotoxic regimens remains a clinical challenge.
      Defining the correct therapeutic strategy for individual patients with breast
      cancer based on the genomic and transcriptomic characteristics of the tumour and 
      the patient remains an area of unmet clinical need. Despite the promise of
      microarray-based predictors of response to chemotherapy, clinical decisions are
      still guided by a limited constellation of biomarkers. In this review we will
      address current genomic and transcriptomic approaches to the stratification of
      adjuvant therapies in breast cancer, the reasons for the limited success in the
      incorporation of novel multi-gene predictors of response to chemotherapy in
      clinical practice and focus on new approaches that aim to understand the clonal
      evolution of the disease. The polygenic nature of drug resistance, and inter- and
      intra-tumour heterogeneity are considered as important research areas, given that
      they may constitute important challenges for the development of
      chemotherapy-specific response predictors.

TI  - Neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer.
PG  - x231-6
AB  - Neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer has become established as the safe and
      often effective therapeutic approach of choice for larger primary and for locally
      advanced breast cancer. The neoadjuvant approach offers the advantages of
      downstaging the disease, potentially reducing the extent of surgery and in an era
      of individualization of therapy, testing the efficacy of therapy administered to 
      patients. The preoperative setting is also an effective way to study the activity
      of novel agents or therapeutic combinations in vivo against human breast cancer. 
      For new therapies, preoperative trials avoid the issue of adaptive resistance and
      pretreatments that can be problematic in the advanced disease setting. For
      evidence of a drug targeting the cancer in vivo, comparisons of endocrine
      therapy, chemotherapy agents and/or targeted agents can provide data on activity 
      and efficacy with a much shorter time frame and many fewer patients than for
      adjuvant trials; effects seen in neoadjuvant trials may even reflect what is
      found in the adjuvant setting. Patient benefits from the neoadjuvant approach may
      be greatest for those who experience complete pathologically documented response 
      (and the consequent survival benefits) and women for whom breast conservation,
      rather than mastectomy, becomes possible.

TI  - Neoadjuvant therapy for ER-positive breast cancers.
PG  - x243-8
AB  - ER-positive, HER-2-negative operable breast cancer represents a heterogeneous
      group of tumors. Tumor subtypes associated with different responses to
      neoadjuvant therapies can be identified through the evaluation of pathological
      features that include grade, the degree of expression of estrogen (ER) and
      progesterone (PgR) receptors and markers of cell proliferation such as Ki67
      labeling index. For patients with a high proliferative index and/or a high grade 
      who have a higher likelihood for a pathologic complete response, the selection of
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy should follow the same algorithm utilized for
      postoperative adjuvant treatments. In particular, both anthracyclines and taxanes
      should be evaluated for the chemotherapy regimen. Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy
      should be considered in place of cytotoxic neoadjuvant therapy for postmenopausal
      patients with tumors with low grade or proliferation and high ER and PgR
      expression. If given, such treatment should be continued for a minimum of 4-8
      months. Selected patients with special types of breast cancer (e.g. pure tubular,
      cribriform and mucinous tumors) have a limited expected benefit from preoperative
      therapy and might receive adjuvant endocrine therapy alone. Tailored neoadjuvant 
      treatments should be considered in patients with ER-positive tumors. Issues
      focusing on safety, quality of life and patient preference should be routinely
      discussed.

TI  - Non-metastatic CRPC and asymptomatic metastatic CRPC: which treatment for which
      patient?
PG  - x251-8
AB  - The introduction of early PSa-based diagnosis has profoundly impacted the
      epidemiology of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Many patients enter 
      the disease at an early stage when the only sign of resistance to androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT) is a progressive elevation of prostate-specific antigen
      (PSA). This created a very heterogeneous population of non-metastatic (M0) CRPC. 
      PSa kinetics is the most powerful indicator of aggressiveness in that population 
      and can be used to trigger imaging investigation and enrollment in clinical
      trials. Several registered and near to come treatments have not been tested in
      that population but in men with more advanced metastatic and often symptomatic
      disease. Several agents have been investigated to delay the onset of the first
      bone metastasis but only one, denosumab, has reached its end-point. Because CRPC 
      remains largely driven by the androgen receptor (AR), physicians have relied on
      second-line hormonal manipulations to delay the progression of the disease,
      including first generation antiandrogens, adrenal synthesis inhibitors, steroids 
      and estrogens. The data however are mostly limited to phase II trials.

TI  - Novel and bone-targeted agents for CRPC.
PG  - x264-7
AB  - Clearly, no neoplasm other than prostate cancer has benefited from so many
      breakthroughs since the beginning of this decade: the past two years can be
      considered exceptional due to the number of emerging agents against
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which have demonstrated positive
      outcomes in phase III trials. Until 2010, docetaxel (Taxotere) was the only agent
      capable of improving survival in patients with metastatic CRPC. Since then,
      positive results from phase III trials have been reported for sipuleucel-T,
      cabazitaxel, denosumab, abiraterone, radium-223, and enzalutamide, while other
      promising agents including notably orteronel, ipilimumab and cabozantinib are
      currently under study. Taken together, the incorporation of these agents in the
      routine management of patients with CRPC is likely to expand their median life
      expectancy, which was only approximately 1 year until the early 2000, to >30
      months in the near future. The availability of these agents will lead to new
      challenges and questions, such as: Can our societies afford the costs? Should we 
      use these agents sequentially or in combination with an incremental benefit? Can 
      we personalise treatment based on the biology of the individual's disease? How
      will we develop new active compounds in the context where a half dozen approved
      agents may confound their potential overall survival effect?

TI  - Diagnostic work-up of carcinoma of unknown primary: from immunohistochemistry to 
      molecular profiling.
PG  - x271-7
AB  - Carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) remains a common and challenging clinical
      problem. The aim of diagnostic work-up in CUP is to classify as specifically as
      possible the cancer affecting the patient, according to the broad tumour type,
      subtype and, where possible, site of origin. This classification currently best
      predicts patient outcome and guides optimal treatment. a stepwise approach to
      diagnostic work-up is described. although pathology is based on morphology, the
      assessment of tissue-specific genes through immunohistochemistry (IHC)
      substantially helps tumour classification at each diagnostic step. For IHC in
      CUP, recent improvements include more standardised approaches and marker panels
      plus new markers. Tissue-specific genes are also being used in CUP work-up
      through molecular profiling. Large-scale profiles of hundreds of tumours of
      different types have been generated, compared and used to generate diagnostic
      algorithms. Commercial tests for CUP classification have been developed at the
      mRNa and microRNA and (miRNA) levels and validated in metastatic tumours and
      CUPs. While currently optimal pathology and IHC remain the 'gold standard' for
      CUP diagnostic work-up, and full clinical correlation is vital, the molecular
      tests appear to perform well: in the main diagnostic challenge of
      undifferentiated or poorly differentiated tumours, molecular profiling performs
      as well as or better than IHC.

TI  - Optimal therapeutic management of patients with distinct clinicopathological
      cancer of unknown primary subsets.
PG  - x282-5
AB  - Cancer of unknown primary sites (CUP) is a compilation of various malignant
      entities--the majority of which behave aggressively and carry poor prognosis. CUP
      is classified into two different clinicopathological groups: the unfavourable
      (poor-prognosis) and the favourable (good-prognosis) group. Patients with
      favourable subsets are treated relevant to the hidden primary tumour chemotherapy
      regimens and/or radiotherapy. These patients exhibit better responses and
      prolonged survival. On the other hand, patients of unfavourable subsets are
      treated with various chemotherapy combinations of platinum- or taxane-containing 
      regimens. Unfortunately, responses and overall survival in this group of CUP
      patient are not very promising. Several independent prognostic factors have been 
      associated with survival of CUP patients. Since CUP is not an unknown disease,
      emerging therapeutic innovations are warranted.

TI  - Emerging topics in anaemia and cancer.
PG  - x289-93
AB  - Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) increase red blood cell (RBC) production
      by activating the erythropoietin receptor on erythrocytic progenitor cells. ESAs 
      are approved in the United States and Europe for treating anaemia in cancer
      patients receiving chemotherapy. ESA safety issues include thromboembolic events 
      and there have been concerns about disease progression and/or mortality in cancer
      patients. This educational supplement paper is based on two recently published
      papers. We review both clinical trial data on ESAs and disease progression and
      preclinical data on how ESAs could affect tumour growth. We conclude that ESAs
      may have little effect on disease progression in chemotherapy patients, and
      preclinical data indicate a direct or indirect effect of ESAs on tumour growth is
      not strongly supported. We also summarise the mechanisms and clinical
      consequences of iron deficiency and anaemia in cancer patients. Randomised
      clinical trials have shown superior efficacy of i.v. iron over oral or no iron in
      reducing blood transfusions, increasing haemoglobin, and improving quality of
      life in ESA-treated anaemic advanced cancer patients. Furthermore, i.v. iron
      without additional ESA should be evaluated as potential treatment in patients
      with chemotherapy-induced anaemia. at recommended doses, i.v. iron is well
      tolerated, particularly compared with oral iron, but caution should be used in
      some specific situations.

TI  - Screening and early detection of lung cancer.
PG  - x320-7
AB  - The greatest news of the past year in this field was the first large-scale early 
      detection trial that could prove a 20% reduction in lung cancer-related mortality
      by screening high-risk individuals with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT).
      Several expert groups and medical societies have assessed the data and concluded 
      that LDCT screening for lung cancer is, however, not ready for large-scale
      population-based implementation. Too many open questions remain, such as
      definition of the at-risk population, timing and intervals of screening, optimal 
      method of acquisition and interpretation of the images, how to handle (false)
      positive findings, and especially cost-effectiveness in relation to other lung
      cancer prevention strategies, mainly smoking cessation. Further analyses and
      several ongoing European trials are eagerly awaited. Much hope also resides in
      the use of biomarkers, as their use in, e.g., blood or exhaled air may provide
      more easy-to-use tests to better stratify high-risk populations for screening
      studies. While exciting research is ongoing in this domain--e.g. with
      microRNAs--none of the tests has yet reached sufficient validation for clinical
      use. Early central lung cancers are more difficult to visualise by CT. For these 
      patients, standard bronchoscopy, complemented by autofluoresence endoscopy, has
      been studied in different screening and follow-up settings.

      in older adults (age >70).
PG  - x339-41
AB  - Establishing an indication for adjuvant chemotherapy in older cancer patients
      represents a major challenge. after surgery, older cancer patients can also have 
      a significant risk of relapse and cancer death (even reported to be higher than
      in younger patients), but this is counterbalanced by the fact that the chance of 
      dying from a noncancer cause is also much higher. a careful geriatric evaluation 
      including assessment of comorbidity can provide some insight into the life
      expectancy and expected benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy for individual
      patients. age-related physiological changes can decrease tolerance of classical
      chemotherapy regimens, indicating the need for close monitoring and preventive
      measures.

TI  - When to order a biopsy to characterise a metastatic relapse in breast cancer.
PG  - x349-53
AB  - Today, the diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer is usually based on radiological
      findings, and therapeutic decisions are made by considering the pathological
      characteristics and predictive markers of the primary tumour. Accumulating
      evidence suggests that tumour characteristics, including estrogen receptor (ER)
      and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), are unstable through tumour 
      progression. Several retrospective studies and, recently, two prospective studies
      have investigated the discrepancies in receptor status between primary tumours
      and the corresponding metastases in a total of 1773 patients (for ER) and 2845
      patients (for HER2). Changes in ER and HER2 status in these studies range from
      14.5% to 40% and from 0% to 37.5%, respectively. In the two prospective studies, 
      a different diagnosis, usually non-malignant, was obtained in 3% and 9% of the
      cases, and the biopsy led to a treatment modification in about one out of seven
      patients. Here, we review and discuss the currently available data and provide
      our recommendations on when a metastatic biopsy should be obtained.

AB  - In the last decade, technological advances, new staging tools, better
      understanding the role of surgery within multimodal treatment concepts in
      advanced stages and progress in the functional assessment of surgical candidates 
      improved the quality of surgery in the management of patients with lung cancer.
      Lung resection with video-assisted thoracoscopic access gained wide acceptance,
      the indication for lobectomy or sublobar resection in early stages was applied
      based on new data and selection for multimodal treatment in stage III is better
      understood based on the data. a major impact on the outcome of patients with lung
      cancer has the treatment in specialized high-volume centers.

PG  - x46-51
AB  - An increase in the number of predominantly elderly patients with early-stage
      non-small-cell lung cancer is anticipated in many Western populations. Patients
      often have major co-morbidities and are at increased risk for surgical morbidity 
      and mortality. In the past decade, the use of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy 
      (SABR) has achieved excellent results, with only mild toxicity in such vulnerable
      patient groups, leading to SABR becoming accepted as a standard of care for unfit
      patients in several countries. The planning and delivery of SABR has rapidly
      improved in recent years, particularly with the use of 'on-board' imaging at
      treatment units, and shortened treatment delivery times. Increasingly, more
      central tumors are being treated using lower doses per fraction (so-called
      risk-adapted schemes). It is also becoming clear that long-term follow-up should 
      take place at specialist centers in order to distinguish the evolving fibrosis
      that is frequently observed from the relatively infrequent local recurrences.
      Given the high local control rates and limited toxicity, increasing attention is 
      being paid to the use of SABR in the subgroup of so-called borderline operable
      patients, and clinical trials comparing surgery and SABR in these patients are
      ongoing.

TI  - What can molecular pathology offer for optimal decision making?
PG  - x63-70
AB  - In recent years, colorectal cancer (CRC), once a uniform disease with
      well-understood carcinogenesis, has been divided into at least five different
      subgroups with distinct precursor lesions, pathways of carcinogenesis,
      morphological, and molecular characteristics. Moreover, new therapeutic concepts 
      with 'targeted' substances have added to the complexity of the management of CRC 
      patients. The clinical value of biomarkers in advanced CRC is indisputable ever
      since activating mutations of the KRAS oncogene have been shown to predict
      resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies. Prognostic
      biomarkers predicting patient outcomes and predictive biomarkers forecasting
      response to a certain therapy may help us to improve therapeutic agent selection 
      and patient management with the ultimate goal of maximizing the benefit of
      treatment and minimizing toxicity. Biomarkers with known implications in advanced
      CRC will be discussed in this paper.

TI  - New insights into the diagnosis of lymphomas.
PG  - x83-8
AB  - The current diagnosis of lymphoid neoplasias is based on the criteria of the
      World Health Organization (WHO) classification. This framework is built on two
      major principles: the stratification of neoplasms according to their derivation
      from precursor or mature cells and the definition of clinically relevant
      nonoverlapping diseases. The diagnosis is established by integrating the
      clinical, morphological, phenotypic, genetic and molecular characteristics of the
      tumors. This approach is reproducible, clinically relevant and scientifically
      sound. The elucidation of the human genome a decade ago and the development of
      high-throughput technologies have opened the possibility to search for
      comprehensive views of the genomic alterations of the tumors that are starting to
      influence our current approach to diagnosis. The new generation of sequencing
      technologies and their systematic application to human cancer and in particular
      to lymphoid neoplasms are revealing a landscape of somatic mutations of
      unprecedented complexity. These studies have already provided a number of
      important findings with functional and clinical implications. The translation of 
      all this knowledge into the clinic is challenging and offers relevant
      perspectives.

      bladder cancer patients.
PG  - OL1744-51
AB  - The CpG promoter methylation has been reported to occur frequently in bladder
      cancer. Moreover, analysis of gene methylation has been shown to be feasible from
      voided urine and can be detected with a high degree of sensitivity. The aim of
      this present study is to determine how methylation patterns of APC, RAR&#946; and
      Survivin genes change during bladder carcinogenesis and to evaluate whether DNA
      methylation could be detected in urine sediment. Using the sensitive assay of
      MSP, we explored the promoter methylation status for the three genes in tumor
      specimens and urine sediment DNA from 32 bladder cancer patients. Methylation
      frequencies of the tested genes in tumor specimens were 100%, 75% and 84.4% for
      APC, RAR&#946; and Survivin, respectively. Hypermethylation of APC was found in
      all pathological grades and stages of bladder cancer. More frequent promoter
      hypermethylation of RAR&#946; and Survivin was observed in high grade tumors and 
      the hypermethylation increased from low to high stages, but there was no
      significant correlation between stages/grades and hypermethylation of these two
      gene promoters. In order to investigate clinical usefulness for noninvasive
      bladder cancer detection, we further analyzed the methylation status in urine
      samples of bladder cancer patients. Methylation of the tested genes in urine
      sediment DNA was detected in the majority of cases that were hypermethylated in
      tumor samples (93.7%) and the frequencies were 79.3% 70.8% and 96.3% for APC,
      RAR&#946; and Survivin, respectively. Our results indicate that methylation of
      APC, RAR&#946; and Survivin gene promoters is a common finding in patients with
      bladder carcinoma. The ability to detect methylation not only in bladder tissue, 
      but also in urine sediments, suggests that methylation markers are promising
      tools for noninvasive detection of bladder cancer.

      Sweden and Norway.
PG  - 549-56
LID - 10.1111/tbj.12001 [doi]
AB  - Mammography screening and postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) both influence
      breast cancer incidence. While breast cancer incidence increased by around 50%
      during the introduction of screening, a smaller decline in incidence has been
      reported in several countries after 2002 when the sales of HT started to decline.
      Data suggest that HT increases the risk of the second most common type of breast 
      cancer, invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) but not the most common, invasive ductal
      carcinoma (IDC). Breast cancer incidences stratified on histological subtypes
      were obtained from the national cancer registries. HT sales data from drug
      consumption statistics and information on the county-level introduction of
      mammography screening were combined, and breast cancer incidence trends were
      estimated using Poisson regression models, focusing on the period after 2002.
      From 2002 to 2007 the annual decrease in breast cancer incidence rates for women 
      aged 50-69 was 1.5% (95% CI -2.3% to -0.7%) in Sweden and 0.8% (95% CI -2.8% to
      1.2%) in the part of Norway not confounded by prevalence screening. Most of the
      decline was in the rates of ILC which dropped by 4.7% (95% CI -6.6% to -2.7%) and
      7.0% (95% CI -12.8% to -0.9%) per year, respectively. The rates of IDC were
      stable in this period. Breast cancer incidence has declined in Sweden and Norway 
      since 2002, but the reduction is moderate compared with the large increase that
      occurred during the introduction of mammography screening. Declining rates of
      ILC, but not of IDC, support the hypothesis that the drop in breast cancer
      incidence is associated with reduced HT use.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of tamoxifen treatment on 
      amount of fibroglandular tissue (FGT), background parenchymal enhancement (BPE), 
      and cysts on breast MRI. Retrospective search identified 96 women with breast
      cancer who had a breast MRI both before and during adjuvant tamoxifen therapy
      between 2002 and 2008. After exclusion of all irradiated breasts, 88 women were
      eligible. Two readers blinded to tamoxifen treatment status independently rated
      level of BPE, amount of FGT, and cysts using a 4-point categorical scale:
      BPE--Minimal, Mild, Moderate, Marked; FGT--Fatty, Scattered, Heterogeneously
      Dense (HD), Dense; Cysts--Minimal, Mild, Moderate, Marked. A consensus
      interpretation was reached in cases of disagreement. During tamoxifen, there was 
      a significant shift from higher to lower degree BPE, cysts, and FGT compared with
      before tamoxifen. BPE, cysts and FGT decreased in 68% (60/88), 38% (33/88), and
      40% (35/88) of women during tamoxifen (p<0.001 for all measures). After the
      exclusion of all cases with minimal BPE, cysts, or FGT on the pre-tamoxifen MRI, 
      the percentage of women demonstrating a decrease in these factors increased to
      81% (60/74), 77% (33/43), and 41% (35/86), respectively. Exclusion of patients
      treated with chemotherapy did not substantially change these results. The
      percentage of women with decreases in FGT and cysts increased with greater
      duration on tamoxifen, whereas decreases in BPE were detected early in treatment 
      (<90 days) and did not change substantially with longer duration on tamoxifen. A 
      significant association exists between treatment with tamoxifen and decreases in 
      BPE, cysts, and FGT on breast MRI.

TI  - A review of recent patents on the protozoan parasite HSP90 as a drug target.
PG  - 2-8
AB  - Diseases caused by protozoan parasites are still an important health problem.
      These parasites can cause a wide spectrum of diseases, some of which are severe
      and have high morbidity or mortality if untreated. Since they are still
      uncontrolled, it is important to find novel drug targets and develop new
      therapies to decrease their remarkable social and economic impact on human
      societies. In the past years, human HSP90 has become an interesting drug target
      that has led to a large number of investigations both at state organizations and 
      pharmaceutical companies, followed by clinical trials. The finding that HSP90 has
      important biological roles in some protozoan parasites like Plasmodium spp,
      Toxoplasma gondii and trypanosomatids has allowed the expansion of the results
      obtained in human cancer to these infections. This review summarizes the latest
      important findings showing protozoan HSP90 as a drug target and presents three
      patents targeting T. gondii, P. falciparum and trypanosomatids HSP90.

TI  - Long-term outcome of breast cancer patients with one to two nodes involved -
      application of nodal ratio.
PG  - 542-8
LID - 10.1111/tbj.12010 [doi]
AB  - Nodal ratio (NR) is defined as the number of involved nodes to the number of
      nodes examined. There is limited information on the application of NR on
      population data. Previous reports in breast cancer generally analyzed one to
      three positive axillary nodes as a single group. This study investigates whether 
      one to three positive axillary nodes is a homogeneous group in prognosis by
      comparing one to two positive nodes to three positive nodes. The population-based
      registry of a Canadian province from 1981 through 1995 was searched. As the
      reliability of nodal assessment depends on the number of nodes sampled, we also
      studied the subgroup of patients with greater than or equal to eight nodes
      dissected. Of a total of 5,996 breast cancer patients, 1187 had one to three
      positive axillary nodes. The 263 patients with three positive nodes compared to
      the 924 patients with one to two nodes fared worse with a significantly reduced
      cause-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). Patients with one to two
      positive nodes had similar CSS (p=0.31) and OS (p=0.63). Among those with greater
      than or equal to eight nodes dissected, there were 677 patients with one to two
      positive nodes. CSS and OS were not significantly different between one versus
      two positive nodes (p=0.16 and 0.34, respectively), but with NR, the
      corresponding p values were 0.0068 and 0.08, respectively. The cutoff value of NR
      0.15 was found to be most useful and confirmed by the validation dataset. NR is
      able to segregate patients better than the absolute number of positive nodes used
      in the current staging system. NR should be incorporated into the staging system.

TI  - Imidazoline derivatives: a patent review (2006--present).
PG  - 1353-65
LID - 10.1517/13543776.2012.727397 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent decades have witnessed the growing interest in the
      development of imidazoline derivatives in drug discovery due to increased
      knowledge in pathogenesis of many diseases. Imidazoline structure has been one of
      the most sought-after scaffolds employed in developing various agents with
      different kinds of pharmacological activities. During 2006 - 2012, imidazoline
      structures have been found in numerous patented compounds for the treatment of
      neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. AREAS COVERED: This paper provides a
      general review of patented imidazoline derivatives from 2006 to 2012. Information
      from articles published in international peer-reviewed journals has also been
      included to give a more exhaustive overview. EXPERT OPINION: With the uncovering 
      of the molecular mechanisms related to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, the
      use of classical and novel imidazoline structures has been more frequently noted 
      in recent (2006 - 2012) patented agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative
      diseases and cancer instead of agents for the treatment of cardiovascular disease
      noticed earlier.

TI  - Efficient inhibition of intraperitoneal ovarian cancer growth in nude mice by
      liposomal delivery of short hairpin RNA against STAT3.
PG  - 701-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1447-0756.2012.02007.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) plays an
      important role in the tumor formation, prognosis and chemoresistance of ovarian
      cancer. Our goal was to investigate the effect of silencing STAT3 on ovarian
      cancer cell apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis and expression of key targets 
      in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The ovarian cancer cell lines A2780CP and A2780s
      were used. STAT3 was knocked down by the plasmid-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) 
      expression system. In vitro, a colony formation assay and Hoechst staining were
      used to examine cell proliferation and apoptosis. The expression level of STAT3
      and apoptosis-related proteins were determined by Western blot. The A2780CP
      intraperitoneal model was used to evaluate the effect of shSTAT3 on tumor growth 
      in mice. Proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis in tumor tissues were
      measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen, TUNEL and CD31 immunostaining,
      respectively. RESULTS: Treatment with shSTAT3 resulted in apoptosis and
      inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro. Western blot analysis demonstrated
      that shSTAT3 induced the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and reduced the
      expression of survivin, Bcl-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor. In vivo,
      the tumor weight was reduced to 13.46% of 5% glucose by shSTAT3/lipoplexes (P <
      0.01), accompanied with apoptosis induction (P < 0.01), proliferation inhibition 
      (P < 0.01) and angiogenesis inhibition (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We find that
      treatment with shSTAT3 inhibits tumor growth in vitro and in vivo by inducing
      apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation. This work should provide the
      scientific foundation for future investigation of shSTAT3 as a strategy for
      ovarian cancer gene therapy and the combination of gene therapy with
      chemotherapy.

TI  - p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 dual labelling as a marker for the presence of high-grade
      cancer cells or disease progression in urinary cytopathology.
PG  - 327-34
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2303.2012.01008.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Overexpression of p16(INK4a) independent of the presence of E6-E7
      oncoproteins of high-risk papillomaviruses has been identified in bladder
      carcinoma in situ lesions with or without concurrent papillary or invasive
      high-grade (HG) urothelial carcinoma. As p16(INK4a) and Ki-67 co-expression
      clearly indicates deregulation of the cell cycle, the aim of this study was to
      investigate the frequency of p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 dual labelling in urinary cytology
      samples. METHODS: Immunolabelling was performed in demounted, destained
      Papanicolaou slides after ThinPrep((R)) processing. A total of 84 urinary
      cytology samples (18 negative, 10 low grade, 19 atypical urothelial cells and 37 
      high grade) were analysed for p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 co-expression. We assessed
      underlying urothelial malignancy with cystoscopy, histopathology and follow-up
      data in every case. RESULTS: Compared with raw histopathological results, p16
      (INK4a) /Ki-67 dual labelling was observed in 48 out of 55 (87.3%) HG lesions and
      in 11 out of 29 (37.9%) negative, papillary urothelial neoplasia of low malignant
      potential or low-grade carcinomas (P = 0.05). All cases with high-grade/malignant
      cytology were dual labelled. Sixteen out of 17 (94.1%) carcinoma in situ cases
      and eight out of 14 (57.1%) cases with atypical urothelial cells matching with HG
      lesions were dual labelled. Extended follow-up allowed three cases of progression
      to be diagnosed in dual-labelled cases with negative/low-grade cytology results
      after a 9- to 11-months delay. CONCLUSIONS: The data show that p16(INK4a) /Ki-67 
      co-expression allows most HG cancer cells to be detected initially and in the
      follow-up period. Additional studies are needed in order to determine whether
      dual labelling can be used as a triage tool for atypical urothelial cells in the 
      urine.

TI  - How many sections are required to clear a tumor? Results from a web-based survey 
      of margin thresholds in Mohs micrographic surgery.
PG  - 179-86

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) offers an unparalleled cure rate for 
      cutaneous malignancy. Its success hinges on achieving reliably negative
      histologic margins. When assessing margins, Mohs surgeons generally examine
      multiple histologic sections per Mohs stage. In some cases, the most-peripheral
      section or sections are clear, but tumor is identified in deeper sections within 
      the same tissue block. OBJECTIVE: To explore approaches to margin analysis in
      these scenarios. METHODS: A web-based survey was administered to members of the
      American College of Mohs Surgery investigating their standard practice when
      definitively tumor-free section(s) are examined during a Mohs stage before
      finding cancer in a deep section. Factors influencing the decision were explored.
      RESULTS: The number of clear sections required to declare margin negativity and
      terminate MMS (margin threshold) varied widely among respondents; 25% were
      comfortable with one clear section, whereas 19% would obtain an additional layer 
      with eight clear sections. Margin thresholds depended on tumor type but were
      independent of surgeon experience. CONCLUSION: Although no consensus emerged, a
      majority of respondents would not take an additional layer with four clear
      sections if resecting basal cell carcinoma. Prospective outcomes data are needed 
      to standardize management of this important oncologic issue.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure is a serious chronic syndrome that is accompanied by
      significant physical and psychological burdens, resulting in poor quality of
      life. AIM: To assess the quality of life of patients with severe heart failure
      and its correlation with patient demographic, socio-economic and clinical
      characteristics. METHOD: We studied 199 patients with heart failure who were
      hospitalized in the Cardiology Department of three general hospitals of Greece
      during a 1-year period. Demographic and socio-economic data were obtained using a
      short questionnaire, while clinical data were obtained from medical record
      review. The assessment of the patients' quality of life was performed using
      Minnesota Life with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLWHFQ). FINDINGS: The mean
      MLWHFQ score was 62.7 (+/-20.3). Significantly lower quality of life was found in
      patients with diabetes mellitus (Coefficient beta (beta)=11.4; 95% Confidence
      Interval (CI), 5.2-17.5), hypertension (beta=10.3; CI, 1.4-19.1), chronic renal
      failure (beta=13.9; CI, 5.9-21.9), chronic respiratory failure (beta=11.2; CI,
      4.7-17.7), cancer (beta=12.3; CI, 2.3-22.4), psychiatric disease (beta=10.5; CI, 
      0.6-20.4) and those patients who were classified in New York Heart Association
      class IV (beta=10.6, CI=4.1-17.0). CONCLUSIONS: The average score of the MLWHFQ
      was high, and this reflects the poor quality of life of patients. Higher scores
      in specific patient groups show the negative influence of these factors in
      quality of life. The holistic care of patients with heart failure by a
      multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals could improve their quality of
      life.

TI  - Detection of N-glycolyated gangliosides in non-small-cell lung cancer using GMR8 
      monoclonal antibody.
PG  - 43-7
LID - 10.1111/cas.12027 [doi]
AB  - Gangliosides are glycosphingolipids found on the cell surface. They act as
      recognition molecules or signal modulators and regulate cell proliferation and
      differentiation. N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc)-containing gangliosides have
      been detected in some neoplasms in humans, although they are usually absent in
      normal human tissues. Our aim was to evaluate the presence of NeuGc-containing
      gangliosides including GM3 (NeuGc) and assess their relationship with the
      prognosis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NeuGc-containing ganglioside
      expression in NSCLC tissues was analyzed immunohistochemically using the mouse
      monoclonal antibody GMR8, which is specific for gangliosides with NeuGc alpha
      2,3Gal-terminal structures. On the basis of NeuGc-containing ganglioside
      expression, we performed survival analysis. We also investigated the differences 
      in the effects of GM3 (N-acetylneuraminic acid [NeuAc]) and GM3 (NeuGc) on
      inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase in A431
      cells. As a result, the presence of NeuGc-containing gangliosides was evident in 
      86 of 93 (93.5%) NSCLC samples. The NSCLC patients with high NeuGc-containing
      ganglioside expression had a low overall survival rate and a significantly low
      progression-free survival rate. In the in vitro study, the inhibitory effect of
      GM3 on EGFR tyrosine kinase in A431 cells after exposure to GM3 (NeuGc) was lower
      than that after exposure to GM3 (NeuAc). In conclusion, NeuGc-containing
      gangliosides including GM3 (NeuGc) are widely expressed in NSCLC, and
      NeuGc-containing ganglioside expression is associated with patient survival. The 
      difference in the effects of GM3 (NeuGc) and GM3 (NeuAc) on the inhibition of
      EGFR tyrosine kinase might contribute to improvement in the prognosis of NSCLC
      patients.

      for stage III non-small-cell lung cancer.
PG  - 93-7
LID - 10.1111/cas.12028 [doi]
AB  - Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for unresectable stage III
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The long-term feasibility and efficacy of
      vinorelbine and cisplatin with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy were
      investigated. Eighteen patients received cisplatin (80 mg/m(2)) on day 1 and
      vinorelbine (20 mg/m(2) in level 1, and 25 mg/m(2) in level 2) on days 1 and 8
      every 4 weeks for four cycles in a phase I trial. Ninety-three patients received 
      the same chemotherapy regimen except for the fixed vinorelbine (20 mg/m(2))
      dosage and consolidation therapy with docetaxel (60 mg/m(2), every 3 weeks). The 
      thoracic radiotherapy consisted of a single dose of 2 Gy once daily to a total
      dose of 60 Gy. A total of 111 patients were analyzed in the present study:
      male/female, 91/20; median age, 60 years; stage IIIA/IIIB, 50/61; and
      squamous/non-squamous histology, 26/85. The 3-, 5-, and 7-year overall survival
      rates (95% CI) were 43.2% (33.9-52.2), 25.2% (17.6-33.5), and 23.2% (15.8-31.4), 
      respectively. The median progression-free survival and median survival time (95% 
      CI) were 13.5 (10.1-16.7) months and 30.0 (24.3-38.8) months, respectively. Four 
      patients (4%) experienced Grade 5 pulmonary toxicities from 4.4 to 9.4 months
      after the start of treatment. In conclusion, approximately 15% of patients with
      unresectable stage III NSCLC could be cured with chemoradiotherapy without severe
      late toxicities after 10 months of follow-up. Although based on the data from
      highly selected population participated in phase I and phase II trial, this
      analysis would strengthen and confirm the previous reports concerning concurrent 
      chemoradiotherapy with third generation cytotoxic agents.

TI  - Structure and dynamics of cardiotoxins.
PG  - 570-84
AB  - Cytotoxins (or cardiotoxins; CTs) are toxins from cobra venom characterized by
      the three-finger (TF) fold. CTs are on average 60-residue-long peptides,
      possessing as many as 4 disulfide bonds. The elements of antiparallel
      beta-structure take origin from the hydrophobic core formed by the disulfides.
      The beta-strands adopt the shape of the three loops, giving the name of the fold.
      While neurotoxins (NTs) - also TF proteins from snake venom - exert their effect 
      through specific interactions with protein receptors, no specific protein target 
      has been found for CTs. Unlike NTs, CTs are amphiphilic and cytotoxic against a
      variety of cells, including cancer ones. Thus, the hypothesis that the activity
      of CTs is caused by their interactions with lipid membranes is currently central.
      To understand molecular basis behind variations in toxicities of CTs highly
      homologous in their sequences, detailed knowledge of their structure and dynamics
      is required. The present review summarizes experimental and computational data on
      the spatial organization of CTs and their dynamics in various environments
      (aqueous solution, membranous milieus).

PG  - 1177-92
LID - 10.1517/17460441.2012.727394 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pim1 is a unique, constitutively active serine/threonine kinase,
      and is a potent oncogene overexpressed in a range of hematologic malignancies and
      solid cancers. It functions as a signaling regulator in cell proliferation and
      survival pathways through substrate phosphorylation. More than 400 small
      molecular Pim1 inhibitors with IC(50)/Ki < 10 muM have been registered in the
      ChEMBL. However, no drug targeting Pim1 has been launched at this present time.
      AREAS COVERED: The authors provide a review of Pim1 inhibitors from the viewpoint
      of the structural analysis of the Pim1-inhibitor complexes. PDB data and PubMed
      literature searches were performed. The inhibitors have been classified and
      summarized by their interactions with Pim1 residues, to facilitate desirable
      inhibitor design. EXPERT OPINION: To obtain a potent and selective Pim1 inhibitor
      as a lead compound, the authors propose the development of compounds which
      simultaneously interact with both the ATP binding site (Lys67, Glu121 and Phe49) 
      and substrate binding residues (Asp128, Asp131 and Glu171). The development of
      Pim1 inhibitors could lead to new therapeutic options for a number of
      hematological malignancies and prostate cancer in the future.

TI  - Laparoscopic-assisted versus open surgery for colorectal cancer: short- and
      long-term outcomes comparison.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1089/lap.2012.0276 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the theoretical advantages of laparoscopic surgery, it is
      still not considered the standard treatment for colorectal cancer patients
      because of criticism concerning oncologic stability. This study aimed at
      examining the short- and long-term follow-up results of laparoscopic surgery
      versus open surgery for colorectal cancer and at investigating clinical outcomes,
      oncologic safety, and any potential advantages of laparoscopic colorectal cancer 
      resection. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a database
      containing the information about patients who underwent surgery for stage I-III
      colorectal cancer from January 2004 to January 2012 at our institution. RESULTS: 
      The patients who underwent the laparoscopic-assisted procedure showed a
      significantly faster recovery than those who underwent open surgery, namely, less
      time to first passing flatus (P=.041), time of first bowel motion (P=.04), time
      to resume normal diet (P=.043), and time to walk independently (P=.031).
      Laparoscopic colorectal surgery caused less pain for patients, leading to lower
      need of analgesic (P=.002) and less hospital recovery time (P=.034), compared
      with patients who underwent open surgery. No differences were found in 3- and
      5-year overall and disease-free survival rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
      suggested that the laparoscopic approach was as safe as the open alternative.
      Laparoscopic-assisted surgery has been shown to be a favorable surgical option
      with better short-term outcomes and similar long-term oncological control
      compared with open resection.

AB  - The aim of the present study is to profile differentially expressed protein
      markers between left-sided colon cancer (LSCC) and right-sided colon cancer
      (RSCC). Fresh tumor tissue samples from LSCC (n = 7) and RSCC (n = 7) groups were
      analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with MALDI-TOF-MS, followed
      by Western blotting. In 50 paraffin embedded samples from each group, levels of
      four differentially expressed proteins (identified by proteomics analysis) were
      measured by tissue microarray with immunohistochemistry staining to compare the
      different protein markers between LSCC and RSCC. Sixteen proteins were found to
      be differentially expressed between LSCC and RSCC. Ten proteins including HSP-60 
      and PDIA1 were identified to be highly expressed in LSCC (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), 
      while the expression of six proteins including EEF1D and HSP-27 were higher in
      RSCC (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). Virtually all of the indentified proteins were
      involved in cellular energy metabolism, protein folding/unfolding, and/or
      oxidative stress. Human colon tumors at various locations have different
      proteomic biomarkers. Differentially expressed proteins associated with energy
      metabolism, protein folding/unfolding and oxidative stress contribute to
      different tumorigenesis, tumor progression, and prognosis between left- and
      right-sided colon cancer.

TI  - Immediate renal transplantation after radical prostatectomy for low-risk prostate
      cancer.
PG  - 162-7
LID - 10.1111/ctr.12023 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: For most cancers, a two- to five-yr period with no evidence of
      disease must be demonstrated before organ transplantation. The natural history of
      prostate cancer is unique both because of extensive pre-treatment screening and
      the ease of post-treatment monitoring for recurrence. Using available predictive 
      models for prostate cancer recurrence, we examine whether current evidence
      supports a prolonged waiting period after radical prostatectomy and before renal 
      transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A MedLine search was conducted to
      identify five series (published between 2000 and 2011), which examined
      biochemical recurrence (BCR) after prostatectomy for low-risk prostate cancer.
      The likelihood of BCR at one, two, and five yr after radical prostatectomy was
      identified for each series. RESULTS: Each of the analyzed series demonstrated
      that the likelihood of BCR after radical prostatectomy for low-risk prostate
      cancer was identical at one, two, and five yr and did not exceed 5%. CONCLUSIONS:
      The likelihood of BCR does not increase during the first five yr after radical
      prostatectomy for low-risk prostate cancer. Additionally, the risk of recurrence 
      approaches zero during this period. Therefore, current evidence does not support 
      the mandated waiting period of five yr before organ transplantation.

TI  - Azaindole derivatives are inhibitors of microtubule dynamics, with anti-cancer
      and anti-angiogenic activities.
PG  - 673-85
LID - 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2012.02230.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Drugs targeting microtubules are commonly used for cancer
      treatment. However, the potency of microtubule inhibitors used clinically is
      limited by the emergence of resistance. We thus designed a strategy to find new
      cell-permeable microtubule-targeting agents. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Using a
      cell-based assay designed to probe for microtubule polymerization status, we
      screened a chemical library and identified two azaindole derivatives, CM01 and
      CM02, as cell-permeable microtubule-depolymerizing agents. The mechanism of the
      anti-tumour effects of these two compounds was further investigated both in vivo 
      and in vitro. KEY RESULTS: CM01 and CM02 induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and
      exerted potent cytostatic effects on several cancer cell lines including
      multidrug-resistant (MDR) cell lines. In vitro experiments revealed that the
      azaindole derivatives inhibited tubulin polymerization and competed with
      colchicines for this effect, strongly indicating that tubulin is the cellular
      target of these azaindole derivatives. In vivo experiments, using a chicken
      chorioallantoic xenograft tumour assay, established that these compounds exert a 
      potent anti-tumour effect. Furthermore, an assay probing the growth of vessels
      out of endothelial cell spheroids showed that CM01 and CM02 exert anti-angiogenic
      activities. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: CM01 and CM02 are reversible
      microtubule-depolymerizing agents that exert potent cytostatic effects on human
      cancer cells of diverse origins, including MDR cells. They were also shown to
      inhibit angiogenesis and tumour growth in chorioallantoic breast cancer
      xenografts. Hence, these azaindole derivatives are attractive candidates for
      further preclinical investigations.

TI  - Modulation of CD147-induced matrix metalloproteinase activity: role of CD147
      N-glycosylation.
PG  - 437-48
LID - 10.1042/BJ20120343 [doi]
AB  - Degradation of the basement membrane by MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) is one
      of the most critical steps in tumour progression. CD147 is a tumour-associated
      antigen that plays a key regulatory role for MMP activities. In the present
      study, mass spectrum analysis demonstrated that the purified native CD147 from
      human lung cancer tissue was N-glycosylated and contained a series of
      high-mannose and complex-type N-linked glycan structures. Moreover, native
      glycosylated CD147 existed exclusively as oligomers in solution and directly
      stimulated MMP production more efficiently than non-glycosylated prokaryotic
      CD147. The glycosylation site mutation results indicated that, among three
      N-glycan attachment sites, the N152Q mutants were retained in the endoplasmic
      reticulum and unfolded protein response signalling was activated. This improper
      intracellular accumulation impaired its MMP-inducing activity. Increased
      beta1,6-branching of N-glycans as a result of overexpression of GnT-V
      (N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V) plays an important role in tumour metastasis.
      In the present study, we identified CD147 as a target protein of GnT-V and found 
      that overexpression of GnT-V resulted in an elevated level of CD147 at the plasma
      membrane and in cell-conditioned medium, thereby increasing the induction of
      MMPs. The present study reveals the important role of N-glycosylation of CD147 in
      its biological function and implied that targeting aberrant beta1,6-branching of 
      N-glycans on CD147 would be valuable for the development of novel therapeutic
      modalities against carcinoma.

TI  - Long sleep duration and cause-specific mortality according to physical function
      and self-rated health: the Ohsaki Cohort Study.
PG  - 209-16

AB  - Although several studies have examined the association between sleep duration and
      all-cause or cause-specific mortality, it is unclear whether long sleep duration 
      might merely reflect decreased physical strength and poorer health status. We
      therefore examined the association between sleep duration and all-cause and
      cause-specific mortality, and conducted stratified analysis based on physical
      function and self-rated health. This study used prospective data from the Ohsaki 
      Cohort Study, conducted in Miyagi Prefecture, in northern Japan. This study
      population comprised 49 256 subjects aged 40-79 years at the baseline survey. We 
      estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of all-cause and
      cause-specific mortality according to the five categories of sleep duration
      (</=6, 7, 8, 9, >/=10 h day(-1) ), treating 7 h as the reference group, employing
      Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis. We found that long sleep duration 
      was associated with mortality. The HRs (95% CIs) of subjects who slept more than 
      10 h were 1.37 (1.27-1.47), 1.49 (1.30-1.71) and 1.53 (1.36-1.73) for mortality
      due to all causes, total cardiovascular disease and other causes of death
      mortality, respectively. The association between long sleep duration and stroke
      mortality was especially marked among subjects with limited physical function and
      poorer health status. However, we did not observe such a trend for mortality due 
      to all causes, total cardiovascular disease, ischaemic heart disease, cancer or
      other causes of death. We conclude that, with the exception of stroke mortality, 
      the association between long sleep duration and mortality is not modified by
      physical function or health status.

AB  - Cancer develops from a single cell with stepwise accumulation of genomic
      alterations. Recent innovative sequencing technologies have made it possible to
      sequence the full cancer genome. Cancer genome sequencing has been productive and
      helpful in the discovery of novel cancer genes. It also has revealed previously
      unknown but intriguing features of the cancer genome such as chromothripsis and
      kataegis. However, careful comparison of these studies has suggested that
      analyses of most tumors still seem to be incomplete, and histopathological
      diagnosis/classification will be essential for refining these data. Based on the 
      improvement of technology and the completion of the cancer gene catalog, genetic 
      diagnosis, such as examination of all potentially druggable mutations, of
      individual cancers will be performed routinely together with histological
      diagnosis. Pathologists will play a central role in both interpreting these
      patho-molecular diagnoses for oncologists, and the process of decision-making
      necessary for individualized medicine.

      carcinomas correlates to lymph node metastasis.
PG  - 684-9

AB  - One of the major factors involved in the prognosis of oral squamous cell
      carcinoma (OSCC) patients is metastasis. Recent progress in cancer stem-like
      cell/cancer-initiating cell (CSC/CIC) research indicates that CSCs are related to
      metastasis. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 - (ALDH1) and SRY-related HMG-box gene 2
      (SOX2) have recently been shown to be putative CSC markers for several human
      malignancies. The aim of this study was to determine the association of ALDH1 and
      SOX2 expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) with lymph node
      metastasis. Immunohistochemical staining of ALDH1, SOX2 and Ki67 was performed in
      80 OSCC tissues. High expression rates of ALDH1 (2%-40%) were found to be related
      to lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0017). Interestingly, we found that SOX2 staining
      could be classified into two patterns: (i) peripheral staining pattern; and (ii) 
      diffuse staining pattern. The diffuse staining pattern showed a significant
      correlation with lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001). No correlation was found
      between Ki67 staining and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.4724). The ALDH1 positive 
      staining rates in metastatic lymph nodes were higher than that in corresponding
      primary OSCC tissues. These results indicate that high expression rates of ALDH1 
      and SOX2 diffuse staining patterns might be novel prediction markers for OSCC
      lymph node metastasis.

AB  - The design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of 18 ferrocenyl derivatives
      (4A-12A and 4B-12B) of the most well-known drug against schistosomiasis, namely
      praziquantel (PZQ), are reported. These compounds, which have been all isolated
      as racemates, were unambiguously characterized by (1)H and (1)(3)C NMR
      spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis as well as by X-ray
      crystallography for 4A, 5A, and 7A. Cytotoxicity studies revealed that the
      complexes were moderately toxic toward a cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) and,
      importantly, significantly less active toward a noncancerous cell line (MRC-5).
      The in vitro anthelmintic activity of the 18 ferrocenyl PZQ derivatives was
      tested against adult Schistosoma mansoni, and values in the micromolar range
      (26-68 muM) were determined for the four most active compounds. It was also
      demonstrated using two compounds of the series as models (8A and 8B) that the
      complexes were stable when incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C in human plasma.

TI  - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene polymorphisms and colorectal
      cancer: a meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies.
PG  - 1390-4
LID - 10.1089/gtmb.2012.0266 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies investigating the association between vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) polymorphisms and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk report
      conflicting results. To clarify the effect of four VEGF (-460T/C, -634G/C,
      +936C/T, and -2578C/A) gene polymorphisms on the risk of developing CRC, we
      carried out a meta-analysis using published data to obtain more precise estimates
      of risk. METHODS: Electronic searches of PubMed and EMBASE were conducted to
      select studies for this meta-analysis. The principal outcome measure was the odds
      ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the risk of CRC associated with 
      four VEGF (-460T/C, -634G/C, +936C/T, and -2578C/A) gene polymorphisms. RESULTS: 
      We identified 12 epidemiologic studies, which included 2770 CRC cases and 2568
      controls. The combined results based on all studies showed that CRC cases had a
      significantly higher frequency of VEGF -634GG (OR=1.24, 95% CI=1.06, 1.44) and
      -2578AA (OR=1.37, 95% CI=1.12, 1.66) genotype and a lower frequency of -634CG
      (OR=0.82, 95% CI=0.71, 0.95) than controls. When stratifying for race, we found
      that patients with CRC had a significantly higher frequency of -460TC (OR=1.54,
      95% CI=1.22, 1.94), -460CC (OR=2.00, 95% CI=1.50, 2.67), and -2578AA (OR=1.38,
      95% CI=1.12, 1.69) and a lower frequency of -2578AA (OR=0.78, 95% CI=0.65, 0.93) 
      genotypes of VEGF than controls, among Caucasians. We also found that patients
      with CRC had a significantly higher frequency of -634GG (OR=1.61, 95% CI=1.20,
      2.15) and a lower frequency of -634CG (OR=0.60, 95% CI=0.46, 0.79) genotypes of
      VEGF than controls, among Asians. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that
      the VEGF -460T/C, -634G/C, and -2578C/A gene polymorphisms are associated with a 
      risk of CRC.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the lived experience of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer 
      using individual interviews. DATA SOURCES: Eleven women who had been diagnosed
      with ovarian cancer within the past five years were interviewed with open-ended
      guiding questions. The narrative responses were analyzed for constitutive
      patterns and relational themes according to Diekelmann and Allen's hermeneutic
      phenomenological process. CONCLUSIONS: This phenomenological study gave voice to 
      the women's experience with ovarian cancer. The following six constitutive
      patterns and associated themes emerged: (a) The Revelation, (b) Jeopardy, (c) On 
      the Lookout, (d) Becoming Normal, and (e) Living Every Moment. IMPLICATIONS FOR
      PRACTICE: An understanding of the common experiences and shared meanings of women
      with ovarian cancer may contribute to earlier diagnosis and improved quality of
      life. The women identified symptoms that should generate concern when reported to
      providers, potentially leading to diagnostic testing. The experiences may also
      serve to inform the development of interventions aimed at meeting the needs of
      women diagnosed with ovarian cancer.

AB  - AIM: The BRCA1 promoter is hypermethylated in ovarian cancer patients. We
      postulated that this hypermethylation might be involved in ovarian cancer
      progression. METHODS: To confirm our hypothesis, tissue and serum samples were
      collected from ovarian carcinoma patients and categorized according to tumor
      stage. Healthy or benign ovarian disease tissue samples and corresponding serum
      samples were used as controls. Breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene 1
      (BRCA1) promoter methylation levels were detected by real-time polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR). Real-time PCR was also used to evaluate BRCA1 gene expression,
      and Western blot was performed to assay the expression of BRCA1 protein. RESULTS:
      BRCA1 showed hypomethylation in 30 normal ovarian and 30 benign ovarian tumors,
      but showed hypermethylation or methylation in ovarian cancer patients. There was 
      also a significant difference in the BRCA1 promoter methylation levels between
      different ovarian cancer stages. Compared to stage I and the control groups,
      there were higher BRCA1 promoter methylation frequencies in stage II and III
      ovarian cancers. BRCA1 methylation correlated with the loss of BRCA1 expression. 
      BRCA1 promoter in stage I tumors showed hypomethylated. CONCLUSION: Promoter
      hypermethylation may act as a biomarker for sporadic ovarian cancer progression, 
      but is unlikely to be helpful in the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer.

TI  - The attenuation of early benzo(a)pyrene-induced carcinogenic insults by diallyl
      disulfide (DADS) in MCF-10A cells.

AB  - Diallyl disulfide (DADS), a garlic organosulfur compound, has been researched as 
      a cancer prevention agent; however, the role of DADS in the suppression of cancer
      initiation in nonneoplastic cells has not been elucidated. To evaluate DADS
      inhibition of early carcinogenic events, MCF-10A cells were pretreated (PreTx)
      with DADS followed by the ubiquitous carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), or
      cotreated (CoTx) with DADS and BaP for up to 24 h. The cells were evaluated for
      changes in cell viability/proliferation, cell cycle, induction of peroxide
      formation, and DNA damage. BaP induced a statistically significant increase in
      cell proliferation at 6 h, which was attenuated with DADS CoTx. PreTx with 6 and 
      60 muM of DADS inhibited BaP-induced G2/M arrest by 68% and 78%, respectively.
      DADS, regardless of concentration or method, inhibited BaP-induced extracellular 
      aqueous peroxide formation within 24 h. DADS attenuated BaP-induced DNA
      single-strand breaks at all time points through both DADS Pre- and CoTx, with
      significant inhibition for all treatments sustained after 6 h. DADS was effective
      in inhibiting BaP-induced cell proliferation, cell cycle transitions, reactive
      oxygen species, and DNA damage in a normal cell line, and thus may inhibit
      environmentally induced breast cancer initiation.

TI  - Investigating the cognitive precursors of emotional response to cancer stress:
      re-testing Lazarus's transactional model.
PG  - 97-121
LID - 10.1111/j.2044-8287.2012.02082.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Lazarus's Transactional Model of stress and coping underwent
      significant theoretical development through the 1990s to better incorporate
      emotional reactions to stress with their appraisal components. Few studies have
      robustly explored the full model. This study aimed to do so within the context of
      a major life event: cancer diagnosis. DESIGN: A repeated measures design was used
      whereby data were collected using self-report questionnaire at baseline (soon
      after diagnosis), and 3- and 6-month follow-up. METHODS: A total of 160 recently 
      diagnosed cancer patients were recruited (mean time since diagnosis = 46 days).
      Their mean age was 64.2 years. Data on appraisals, core-relational themes, and
      emotions were collected. Data were analysed using both Spearman's correlation
      tests and multivariate regression modelling. RESULTS: Longitudinal analysis
      demonstrated weak correlation between change scores of theoretically associated
      components and some emotions correlated more strongly with cognitions
      contradicting theoretical expectations. Cross-sectional multivariate testing of
      the ability of cognitions to explain variance in emotion was largely theory
      inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: Although data support the generic structure of the
      Transactional Model, they question the model specifics. Larger scale research is 
      needed encompassing a wider range of emotions and using more complex statistical 
      testing. STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT?: *
      Stress processes are transactional and coping outcome is informed by both
      cognitive appraisal of the stressor and the individual's emotional response
      (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). * Lazarus (1999) made specific hypotheses about which 
      particular stress appraisals would determine which emotional response, but only a
      small number of these relationships have been robustly investigated. * Previous
      empirical testing of this theory has been limited by design and statistical
      limitations. WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD?: * This study empirically investigates the
      cognitive precedents of a much larger range of emotional outcomes than has
      previously been attempted in the literature. * Support for the model at a general
      level is established: this study demonstrates that both primary and secondary
      appraisals, and core-relational themes are important variables in explaining
      variance in emotional outcome. * The specific hypotheses proposed by Lazarus
      (1999) are not, however, supported: using data-driven approaches we demonstrate
      that equally high levels of variance can be explained using entirely different
      cognitive appraisals than those hypothesized.

TI  - Pathological complete response and sphincter-sparing surgery after neoadjuvant
      radiochemotherapy with regional hyperthermia for locally advanced rectal cancer
      compared with radiochemotherapy alone.
PG  - 707-14
LID - 10.3109/02656736.2012.722263 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of regional hyperthermia on rates of complete 
      pathological response (pCR) and sphincter-sparing surgery in the context of an
      up-to-date radiochemotherapy protocol for locally advanced rectal cancer.
      METHODS: Between 2007 and 2010, 106 patients with locally advanced cancer of the 
      middle and lower rectum were admitted to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy either
      with (n = 61) or without (n = 45) regional hyperthermia. A retrospective
      comparison was performed between two groups: 45 patients received standard
      treatment consisting of 5040 cGy in 28 fractions to the pelvis and 5-fluorouracil
      (RCT group) and 61 patients received the same treatment in combination with
      regional hyperthermia (HRCT group). Target temperature was 40.5 degrees C for at 
      least 60 min. Total mesorectal excision was performed routinely. RESULTS: pCR was
      seen in 6.7% of patients in the RCT group and 16.4% in the HRCT group. Patients
      who received at least four hyperthermia treatments (n = 40) achieved a
      significantly higher pCR rate (22.5%) than the remaining 66 patients (p = 0.043).
      Rates of sphincter-sparing surgery were similar in both groups with 64% in the
      RCT group and 66% in HRCT. When considering only low-lying tumours located within
      8 cm of the anal verge prior to treatment, the rate of sphincter-sparing surgery 
      was 57% in the HRCT group compared with 35% in the RCT group (p = 0.077).
      CONCLUSION: The combination of regional hyperthermia and neoadjuvant
      radiochemotherapy may lead to an increased pCR rate in locally advanced rectal
      cancer. Patients with low-lying tumours especially may benefit when additional
      downsizing allows sphincter-preserving surgery.

TI  - Why is the Liverpool care pathway used for some dying cancer patients and not
      others? Healthcare professionals' perspectives.
PG  - 524
LID - 10.1186/1756-0500-5-524 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite evidence suggesting that the Liverpool Care Pathway for the
      Dying Patient is a structured and proficient means of supporting care delivery in
      the last hours or days of life, discrepancies in uptake are widespread. This
      exploratory study sought to understand why patients dying of cancer in oncology
      wards of one hospital trust were, or were not, supported by the LCP. A purposive 
      qualitative case study design was used; each case represented a patient who had
      died and their most involved nurse and doctor. In-depth interviews explored both 
      recollections of the 'case' and wider experiences of using the Pathway in
      end-of-life care. Eleven healthcare professionals were interviewed about their
      involvement in the end-of-life care of six patients. For four of these patients
      care was supported by the LCP. FINDINGS: Although doctors and nurses reported
      they preferred to use the Pathway to ensure comfortable death, an important
      factor influencing their decisions was time of death. Access to timely senior
      review was regarded as an essential preliminary to placing patients on the
      Pathway but delayed access 'out of hours' was commonly experienced and tensions
      arose from balancing conflicting priorities. Consequently, the needs of dying
      patients sometimes failed to compete with those receiving curative treatment.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that greater attention should be focused on 'out
      of hours' care in hospitals to ensure regular senior review of all patients at
      risk of dying and to support front line staff to communicate effectively and make
      contingency plans focused on patients' best interests.

TI  - From despair to hope: a longitudinal study of illness perceptions and coping in a
      psycho-educational group intervention for women with breast cancer.
PG  - 526-45
LID - 10.1111/j.2044-8287.2012.02100.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal
      relationships of illness perceptions, coping, and distress in women with breast
      cancer. Illness perceptions and coping at baseline and changes in these variables
      over time served as possible predictors of distress at two follow-up points.
      DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-seven women with breast cancer who participated in a
      psychosocial aftercare programme completed a questionnaire before the start of
      the intervention, directly after the end of the intervention, and 1 year after
      the start of the intervention. Study variables were assessed with the Illness
      Perception Questionnaire-Revised (illness perceptions), the COPE (coping), and
      the Hopkins Symptom Check List (distress). RESULTS: Results showed that 43% of
      variance in distress at baseline was explained by participants' illness
      perceptions. Cyclical timeline perceptions were the strongest predictor of
      distress at baseline. Longitudinal data revealed that after the end of the
      intervention, the intensity of general distress and breast cancer-related
      emotions had decreased significantly. Partial correlations showed that baseline
      illness perceptions were unrelated to distress at follow-up. However, changes in 
      illness perceptions (perceptions about the cyclical and chronic timeline and
      symptoms associated with breast cancer) showed significant associations with
      distress at both follow-up assessments. Associations of follow-up distress with
      coping styles were less consistent. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that changes
      in illness perceptions are related to an improvement or worsening of patients'
      emotional well-being over time. These findings hold promise for the development
      of interventions that specifically target patients' representations of their
      illness.

LID - 10.1186/1746-1596-7-127 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the expression of Golgi phosphoprotein-3 (GOLPH3) in
      prostate cancer and determine its prognostic value. METHODS: Immunohistochemical 
      staining for GOLPH3 was performed on tissue microarrays of 342 prostate patients.
      The correlation between GOLPH3 expression with its clinicopathologic factors was 
      also analyzed in order to determine its prognostic significance. RESULTS: GOLPH3 
      expression of normal prostate tissues, benign prostate hyperplasia, high-grade
      prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and hormone-dependent prostate cancer (HDPC)
      did not show any statistically significant difference. In contrast, statistically
      significant difference was reported in moderate/intense GOLPH3 expression in
      cases diagnosed with HDPC and castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (P <
      0.0005). Moderate /intense expression of GOLPH3 was associated with androgen
      independence (P = 0.012), higher Gleason score (P = 0.017), bone metastasis (P = 
      0.024), higher baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (P = 0.038), and higher
      PSA nadir (P = 0.032). A significantly negative correlation was found between
      moderate/intense GOLPH3 expression and disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 0.28, P 
      = 0.012) and overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.42, P = 0.027). Univariated analysis
      indicated that moderate/intense GOLPH3 expression created a significantly
      prognostic impact in patients with CRPC. On the other hand, multivariate analysis
      indicated that GOLPH3 was a significantly independent prognostic factor of DFS (P
      = 0.027) in all prostate cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, it was
      discovered that the overexpression of GOLPH3 is associated with the transition of
      prostate cancer from hormone sensitive phase to hormone refractory phase. GOLPH3 
      might be an important prognostic factor of DFS and OS in patients with prostate
      cancer. In totality, GOLPH3 could be used as a novel candidate in devising a more
      effective therapeutic strategy to tackle CRPC. VIRTUAL SLIDES: The virtual

PG  - 3563-78

AB  - The strength and duration of NF-kappaB signaling are tightly controlled by
      multiple negative feedback mechanisms. However, in cancer cells, these feedback
      loops are overridden through unclear mechanisms to sustain oncogenic activation
      of NF-kappaB signaling. Previously, we demonstrated that overexpression of
      miR-30e* directly represses IkappaBalpha expression and leads to hyperactivation 
      of NF-kappaB. Here, we report that miR-182 was overexpressed in a different set
      of gliomas with relatively lower miR-30e* expression and that miR-182 directly
      suppressed cylindromatosis (CYLD), an NF-kappaB negative regulator. This
      suppression of CYLD promoted ubiquitin conjugation of NF-kappaB signaling pathway
      components and induction of an aggressive phenotype of glioma cells both in vitro
      and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that TGF-beta induced miR-182 expression,
      leading to prolonged NF-kappaB activation. Importantly, the results of these
      experiments were consistent with an identified significant correlation between
      miR-182 levels with TGF-beta hyperactivation and activated NF-kappaB in a cohort 
      of human glioma specimens. These findings uncover a plausible mechanism for
      sustained NF-kappaB activation in malignant gliomas and may suggest a new target 
      for clinical intervention in human cancer.

      gastric cancer spread.
PG  - 197
LID - 10.1186/1477-7819-10-197 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) is commonly used to
      stage patients with gastric cancer, even though the technique often shows low
      specificity for lymph-node involvement. METHODS: In this study, 111 patients with
      gastric cancer who consecutively underwent MDCT scan followed by radical surgical
      treatment at our hospital were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: In total, 3632
      lymph nodes from 643 lymphatic stations were studied and then correlated with
      radiological features. Lymph-node size was not always associated with
      infiltration. Of the 261 lymph-node stations that were not radiologically
      detected, 60 (22.9%) were infiltrated. There were 108 stations with lymph nodes
      larger than 10 mm seen on MDCT, of which 67 (62%) had lymphatic invasion. The
      sensitivity was 32.6%, specificity 90.6%, positive predictive value 62.0%,
      negative predictive value 74.2%, and accuracy 72.1%. When three lymph nodes, at
      least one of which was larger than 10 mm, were detected in the same station,
      infiltration was confirmed with 99% specificity in 93.8% of patients. Moreover,
      all of the 13 patients in whom three lymph nodes larger than 10 mm were detected 
      in different neighboring stations had lymphatic invasion. CONCLUSIONS: Although
      presence of lymph nodes greater than 10 mm in size is not, in itself, sufficient 
      to confirm lymphatic invasion, nodal involvement can be hypothesized when
      associated images are detected by MDCT.

TI  - Genetic association with overall survival of taxane-treated lung cancer patients 
      - a genome-wide association study in human lymphoblastoid cell lines followed by 
      a clinical association study.
PG  - 422
LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-12-422 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Taxane is one of the first line treatments of lung cancer. In order
      to identify novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that might contribute to
      taxane response, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for two
      taxanes, paclitaxel and docetaxel, using 276 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs),
      followed by genotyping of top candidate SNPs in 874 lung cancer patient samples
      treated with paclitaxel. METHODS: GWAS was performed using 1.3 million SNPs and
      taxane cytotoxicity IC50 values for 276 LCLs. The association of selected SNPs
      with overall survival in 76 small or 798 non-small cell lung cancer (SCLC, NSCLC)
      patients were analyzed by Cox regression model, followed by integrated
      SNP-microRNA-expression association analysis in LCLs and siRNA screening of
      candidate genes in SCLC (H196) and NSCLC (A549) cell lines. RESULTS: 147 and 180 
      SNPs were associated with paclitaxel or docetaxel IC50s with p-values <10-4 in
      the LCLs, respectively. Genotyping of 153 candidate SNPs in 874 lung cancer
      patient samples identified 8 SNPs (p-value < 0.05) associated with either SCLC or
      NSCLC patient overall survival. Knockdown of PIP4K2A, CCT5, CMBL, EXO1, KMO and
      OPN3, genes within 200 kb up-/downstream of the 3 SNPs that were associated with 
      SCLC overall survival (rs1778335, rs2662411 and rs7519667), significantly
      desensitized H196 to paclitaxel. SNPs rs2662411 and rs1778335 were associated
      with mRNA expression of CMBL or PIP4K2A through microRNA (miRNA) hsa-miR-584 or
      hsa-miR-1468. CONCLUSIONS: GWAS in an LCL model system, joined with clinical
      translational and functional studies, might help us identify genetic variations
      associated with overall survival of lung cancer patients treated paclitaxel.

PG  - 423
LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-12-423 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maintenance therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) aims to
      extend disease control after first-line chemotherapy with active and
      well-tolerated agents. The utility of continuation maintenance therapy requires
      further research. METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, phase 2 study compared
      continuation maintenance therapy with pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 every 21 days) and
      best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC alone in patients with advanced,
      non-squamous NSCLC who had not progressed after 4 cycles of induction
      chemotherapy with pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2). The primary
      endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) from randomization, was analyzed
      using a Cox model, stratified for the tumor response at the end of induction
      therapy, at a one-sided alpha of 0.2. Secondary endpoints: response and disease
      control rates, overall survival (OS), one year survival rates, and
      treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). RESULTS: A total of 106 patients
      commenced induction therapy, of whom 55 patients were randomized to maintenance
      pemetrexed/BSC (n = 28) or BSC (n = 27). Although the median PFS time for
      maintenance phase for both arms was 3.2 months, the one-sided p-value for the PFS
      HR comparison was less than the prespecified limit of 0.2 (HR = 0.76, two-sided
      95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42 to 1.37; one-sided p-value = 0.1815),
      indicating that PFS was sufficiently long in the pemetrexed/BSC arm to warrant
      further investigation. Similar PFS results were observed for the overall study
      period (induction plus maintenance) and when the PFS analysis was adjusted for
      sex, baseline disease stage, and the ECOG PS prior to randomization. The median
      OS for the maintenance phase was 12.2 months (95%CI: 5.6 to 20.6) for the
      pemetrexed/BSC arm and 11.8 months (95% CI: 6.3 to 25.6) for BSC arm. The
      one-year survival probabilities were similar for both arms for the maintenance
      phase and the overall study period. Both the induction and continuation
      maintenance therapies were generally well-tolerated, and similar proportion of
      patients in each arm experienced at least 1 grade 3/4 TEAE (pemetrexed/BSC,
      17.9%; BSC, 18.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Continuation pemetrexed maintenance therapy
      resulted in promising PFS with an acceptable safety profile in a Middle Eastern
      population with advanced non-squamous NSCLC and is worthy of further
      investigation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00606021.

      preservation options because most established methods, such as embryo and oocyte 
      cryopreservation, require several weeks to complete. Women with BRCA mutations,
      on the other hand, may be more aware of fertility issues and motivated to see
      fertility preservation specialists earlier. Fear of exposure to estrogen limits
      access to fertility preservation via embryo or oocyte cryopreservation; however, 
      the use of aromatase inhibitors as ovarian stimulants reduces such concern.
      Ovarian cryopreservation can be used when there is insufficient time to perform
      ovarian stimulation because this technique does not require hormonal stimulation,
      but there are safety concerns both in women with BRCA mutations and in patients
      with hormone receptor-positive disease as well. There does not seem to be a
      proven ovarian suppression strategy to preserve fertility in women with breast
      cancer. Pregnancy appears to be safe for breast cancer survivors but studies
      specific for women with BRCA mutations are lacking. Women with BRCA mutations may
      elect to use preimplantation genetic diagnosis during in vitro fertilization to
      avoid transmitting the mutation, but there may be psychosocial difficulties in
      entertaining this option. Overall, the last decade has brought many options for
      women with breast cancer considering fertility preservation, but numerous
      challenges remain. The presence of BRCA mutations further contributes to these
      challenges.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fork head box M1 (FoxM1) is a proliferation-associated transcription 
      factor essential for cell cycle progression. Numerous studies have documented
      that FoxM1 has multiple functions in tumorigenesis and its elevated levels are
      frequently associated with cancer progression. The present study was conducted to
      investigate the expression of FoxM1 and its prognostic significance in clear cell
      renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Meanwhile, the function of FoxM1 in human ccRCC was
      further investigated in cell culture models. METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR,
      western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to explore FoxM1 expression in
      ccRCC cell lines and primary ccRCC clinical specimens. FoxM1 expression was
      knocked down by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in Caki-1 and 786-O cells;
      proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle, migration, invasion, and
      angiogenesis were assayed. RESULTS: FoxM1 expression was up-regulated in the
      majority of the ccRCC clinical tissue specimens at both mRNA and protein levels. 
      Clinic pathological analysis showed that FoxM1 expression was significantly
      correlated with primary tumor stage (P <0.001), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.01),
      distant metastasis (P = 0.01), TNM stage (P < 0.001) and histological grade (P = 
      0.003). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that high FoxM1 expression was 
      associated with poor prognosis in ccRCC patients (P < 0.001). FoxM1 expression
      was an independent prognostic marker of overall ccRCC patient survival in a
      multivariate analysis (P = 0.008). Experimentally, we found that down-regulation 
      of FoxM1 inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest with reduced 
      expression of cyclin B1, cyclin D1, and Cdk2, and increased expression of p21 and
      p27. Also, down-regulation of FoxM1 reduced expression and activity of matrix
      metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
      resulting in the inhibition of migration, invasion, and angiogenesis.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that FoxM1 expression is likely to play
      important roles in ccRCC development and progression, and that FoxM1 is a
      prognostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target for ccRCC.

      camptothecin-like topoisomerase I inhibitors.

AB  - Topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitors applied in cancer therapy such as topotecan and
      irinotecan are derivatives of the natural alkaloid camptothecin (CPT). The
      mechanism of CPT poisoning of TOP1 rests on inhibition of the re-ligation
      function of the enzyme resulting in the stabilization of the TOP1-cleavable
      complex. In the presence of CPTs this enzyme-DNA complex impairs transcription
      and DNA replication, resulting in fork stalling and the formation of DNA
      double-strand breaks (DSB) in proliferating cells. As with most
      chemotherapeutics, intrinsic and acquired drug resistance represents a hurdle
      that limits the success of CPT therapy. Preclinical data indicate that resistance
      to CPT-based drugs might be caused by factors such as (a) poor drug accumulation 
      in the tumor, (b) high rate of drug efflux, (c) mutations in TOP1 leading to
      failure in CPT docking, or (d) altered signaling triggered by the drug-TOP1-DNA
      complex, (e) expression of DNA repair proteins, and (f) failure to activate cell 
      death pathways. This review will focus on the issues (d-f). We discuss
      degradation of TOP1 as part of the repair pathway in the processing of TOP1
      associated DNA damage, give a summary of proteins involved in repair of
      CPT-induced replication mediated DSB, and highlight the role of p53 and
      inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), particularly XIAP and survivin, in
      cancer cell resistance to CPT-like chemotherapeutics.

      screening: a systematic review.
PG  - 415-23
LID - 10.1017/S0266462312000542 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The European Code Against Cancer recommends individuals aged >/= 50
      should participate in colorectal cancer screening. CT-colonography (CTC) is one
      of several screening tests available. We systematically reviewed evidence on, and
      identified key factors influencing, cost-effectiveness of CTC screening. METHODS:
      PubMed, Medline, and the Cochrane library were searched for cost-effectiveness or
      cost-utility analyses of CTC-based screening, published in English, January 1999 
      to July 2010. Data was abstracted on setting, model type and horizon, screening
      scenario(s), comparator(s), participants, uptake, CTC performance and cost,
      effectiveness, ICERs, and whether extra-colonic findings and medical
      complications were considered. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were identified from the 
      United States (n = 11), Canada (n = 2), and France, Italy, and the United Kingdom
      (1 each). Markov state-transition (n = 14) or microsimulation (n = 2) models were
      used. Eleven considered direct medical costs only; five included indirect costs. 
      Fourteen compared CTC with no screening; fourteen compared CTC with
      colonoscopy-based screening; fewer compared CTC with sigmoidoscopy (8) or fecal
      tests (4). Outcomes assessed were life-years gained/saved (13), QALYs (2), or
      both (1). Three considered extra-colonic findings; seven considered
      complications. CTC appeared cost-effective versus no screening and, in general,
      flexible sigmoidoscopy and fecal occult blood testing. Results were mixed
      comparing CTC to colonoscopy. Parameters most influencing cost-effectiveness
      included: CTC costs, screening uptake, threshold for polyp referral, and
      extra-colonic findings. CONCLUSION: Evidence on cost-effectiveness of CTC
      screening is heterogeneous, due largely to between-study differences in
      comparators and parameter values. Future studies should: compare CTC with
      currently favored tests, especially fecal immunochemical tests; consider
      extra-colonic findings; and conduct comprehensive sensitivity analyses.

LID - 10.1186/1748-717X-7-161 [doi]
AB  - The management of resectable rectal cancer continues to be guided by clinical
      trials and advances in technique. Although surgical advances including total
      mesorectal excision continue to decrease rates of local recurrence, the
      management of locally advanced disease (T3-T4 or N+) benefits from a
      multimodality approach including neoadjuvant concomitant chemotherapy and
      radiation. Circumferential resection margin, which can be determined
      preoperatively via MRI, is prognostic. Toxicity associated with radiation therapy
      is decreased by placing the patient in the prone position on a belly board,
      however for patients who cannot tolerate prone positioning, IMRT decreases the
      volume of normal tissue irradiated. The use of IMRT requires knowledge of the
      patterns of spreads and anatomy. Clinical trials demonstrate high variability in 
      target delineation without specific guidance demonstrating the need for peer
      review and the use of a consensus atlas. Concomitant with radiation, fluorouracil
      based chemotherapy remains the standard, and although toxicity is decreased with 
      continuous infusion fluorouracil, oral capecitabine is non-inferior to the
      continuous infusion regimen. Additional chemotherapeutic agents, including
      oxaliplatin, continue to be investigated, however currently should only be
      utilized on clinical trials as increased toxicity and no definitive benefit has
      been demonstrated in clinical trials. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are
      evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed
      every two years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development
      and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer 
      reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology
      (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures
      by the panel. In those instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive,
      expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and fatal brain tumor. GBM
      is resistant to chemotherapy and radiation. Recent studies have shown that
      glioma-initiating cells (GICs), which have characteristics of cancer stem cells, 
      are responsible for the resistance to chemotherapy and radiation and regrowth. No
      effective therapy for GICs has been developed. Here we showed that D-isomer
      peptides (dPasFHV-p53C') consisting of a cell-penetrating peptide (FHV),
      penetration accelerating sequence (Pas) and C-terminus of p53 (p53C') induced the
      cell death of GICs. dPasFHV-p53C' was effectively transduced into human GICs. The
      peptides dose-dependently inhibited cell growth and at 3 muM completely blocked
      the growth of GICs but not embryonic stem cells. Autophagic cell death was
      observed in the GICs treated with dPasFHV-p53C' but apoptosis was not. dPasFHV
      without p53C' showed the same effect as dPasFHV-p53C', suggesting Pas to play a
      critical role in the cell death of GICs. Finally, dPasFHV-p53C' reduced tumor
      mass in mice transplanted with GICs. Peptide transduction therapy using
      dPasFHV-p53C' could be a new method for the treatment of GBM.

TI  - Anesthetic management during labor and delivery: a 21-year review of women with
      cancer in a tertiary care center.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To describe the anesthetic management of labor and delivery in
      patients presenting with cancer during pregnancy at one institution. DESIGN:
      Retrospective data collection of pregnant cancer patients who delivered between
      January 1988 and December 2009. SETTING: University-affiliated teaching hospital.
      MEASUREMENTS: Clinical data on cancer diagnosis and treatment and obstetric,
      neonatal, and anesthetic management of the study patients were compiled. Analysis
      was done based on whether the cancer was diagnosed before or during pregnancy.
      MAIN RESULTS: The incidence of cancer during pregnancy at our institution was
      0.1%. No difference was noted in the incidence of cancer diagnosed before and
      during pregnancy was noted. Women with a cancer diagnosis during pregnancy had
      more clinical symptoms, a higher rate of inductions (37% vs 11%; P = 0.0002) and 
      premature deliveries (48% vs 20%; P = 0.0003) than those with a cancer diagnosis 
      before delivery. No differences between groups in neonatal outcome were noted.
      Most patients received regional anesthesia for labor and delivery (75%); a
      significant number (22%) also received general anesthesia for cesarean section.
      Life-threatening complications were seen in those with mediastinal tumors or
      metastases. CONCLUSION: Women with cancer diagnosed during pregnancy are likely
      to require prompt therapeutic intervention and have a potential for premature
      delivery. Anesthetic management should be tailored to the individual type of
      cancer, depending on the severity of symptoms, stage of cancer, and associated
      systemic involvement.

TI  - Low cholesterol, statins and outcomes in patients with first-ever acute ischemic 
      stroke.
PG  - 213-20
LID - 10.1159/000342302 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High cholesterol has been associated with better stroke outcomes.
      Conversely, a protective effect of prestroke statin use in the acute phase of
      stroke has been reported. The effect of low cholesterol on outcome in patients
      with and without prestroke statin treatment has not been studied. We assessed the
      association between low cholesterol and ischemic stroke short- and long-term
      outcomes and studied potential interactions with statin treatment in patients
      with a first-ever ischemic stroke in a prospective national registry. METHODS:
      Ischemic stroke patients in the National Acute Stroke Israeli (NASIS) registry
      with a first-ever stroke and no previous disability, dementia or cancer admitted 
      in all hospitals nationwide during 2-month periods in 2004, 2007 and 2010 were
      included (n = 1,895). Cholesterol levels </=155 mg/dl (1st quintile) were defined
      as low cholesterol and patients treated with statins for at least 7 days before
      stroke onset were categorized as prestroke statin treated. Severe stroke (NIHSS
      >/=11), total anterior circulation infarction, poor functional outcome (defined
      as discharged to a nursing facility or modified Rankin Scale >3 or death), and
      mortality at discharge and at 3 years were the study outcomes. Associations
      between low cholesterol and outcomes at discharge were assessed separately in
      patients with and without prestroke statin treatment using multiple logistic
      regression analyses. Mortality at 3 years was assessed in a subset of 681
      patients with Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Patients were 67.4 +/-
      13.5 years old on average; 43.1% were women. Low cholesterol was associated with 
      higher rates of stroke risk factors. Controlling for age, sex, hypertension,
      diabetes, current smoking, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure and
      atrial fibrillation, low cholesterol was significantly associated with severe
      stroke, total anterior circulation infarction and poor functional outcome in
      patients with and without statin treatment. There were no interactions between
      low cholesterol and prestroke statin therapy in association with outcomes. Short-
      and long-term mortality rates were increased for patients with low cholesterol
      (5.2% at discharge and 35% at 3-years) compared with higher levels (2.5% at
      discharge and 20.5% at 3 years). Adjusted mortality risks were increased for
      patients with low cholesterol; however, this finding was statistically
      significant only for patients not on statins before the stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Low 
      cholesterol is associated with increased stroke severity and poorer functional
      outcome in patients with and without prestroke statin use. Low-cholesterol
      statin-naive patients show increased risks of mortality. 'Reverse epidemiology'
      in the association between cholesterol and outcome is possible in patients with
      ischemic stroke.

AB  - As operations for lung cancer become more common, more anomalies of various
      pulmonary arteries and veins are being encountered. Persistent left superior vena
      cava (PLSVC) is caused by abnormal development of the sinus venosus in early
      fetal life. In cases of PLSVC with left lung cancer, particular care must be
      exercised during the excision of the pulmonary vein, focusing on the region into 
      which the PLSVC flows. In such anomalous cases, proper excision of the pulmonary 
      artery and vein and lymph node dissection require a firm grasp of anatomic detail
      using preoperative computed tomographic scanning.

TI  - The antitumor effect of GDC-0941 alone and in combination with rapamycin in
      breast cancer cells.
PG  - 273-81
LID - 10.1159/000341812 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a key potential target in breast cancer therapy.
      Because some cancer cell lines are resistant to mTOR inhibition, we combined the 
      mTOR inhibitor with the PI3K inhibitor and assayed the inhibitory effect of this 
      combination versus that of a single inhibitor. METHODS: The proliferation of
      MCF7, SK-BR-3, T-47D, and MDA-MB-231 cells was measured by MTT assay in the
      presence of GDC-0941 and/or rapamycin. Afterwards, we determined the visible
      changes in signaling in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by Western blotting. RESULTS:
      GDC-0941 exhibited excellent inhibition on MCF7, T-47D and SK-BR-3 cells with
      different characteristics. In addition, GDC-0941 blocked the feedback of PI3K/Akt
      through S6K1, resulting in decreased Akt activity by rapamycin activation. The
      combination of GDC-0941 and rapamycin downregulated the key components of the
      cell cycle machinery, such as cyclin D1 and upregulated the apoptotic markers.
      CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that GDC-0941, either alone or in combination
      with rapamycin, may serve as a new, promising approach for breast cancer
      treatment.

      chemotherapeutics.
PG  - 334-42
LID - 10.1111/cbdd.12059 [doi]
AB  - Hes1 is a key transcriptional regulator primarily controlled by the Notch
      signaling pathway, and recent studies have demonstrated both an oncogenic and
      tumor suppressor role for Hes1, depending on the cell type. Small molecules that 
      activate and inhibit Hes1 activity hold promise as future anticancer
      chemotherapeutics. We have utilized a cell-based dual luciferase assay to
      identify modulators of Hes1 expression in a medium-throughput format. A modest
      screen was performed in HCT-116 colon cancer cell lines, and two small molecules 
      were identified and characterized as Hes1 regulators. Compound 3 induced Hes1
      expression and exhibited anticancer effects in pulmonary carcinoid tumor cells, a
      cell type in which the upregulated Notch/Hes1 signaling plays a tumor suppressive
      role. Treatment of HCT-116 cells with compound 12 resulted in Hes1 downregulation
      and antitumor effects.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We have recently shown that detection of CST6 promoter methylation in
      primary breast tumors can provide important prognostic information in patients
      with operable breast cancer and that CST6 promoter is also methylated in
      Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC). In this study we evaluated the presence of CST6
      promoter methylation in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) circulating in plasma of breast
      cancer patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Our study material consisted of: a) a pilot 
      testing group of 27 patients with stage I-III operable breast cancer, 46 patients
      with verified metastasis and 37 healthy donors and b) an independent cohort of
      123 consecutive stage I-III operable breast cancer patients. Methylated and
      unmethylated CST6 promoter sequences were detected by using methylation-specific 
      PCR (MSP). CST6 immunohistochemical detection was performed in 20 corresponding
      primary tumor tissues. RESULTS: In the pilot testing group, CST6 promoter was
      methylated in 8/27 (29.6%) operable breast cancer patients, in 6/46 (13.0%)
      patients with verified metastasis but none of 37 healthy individuals (0%). In the
      independent cohort, 49/123 (39.8%) operable breast cancer patients were found
      positive. During the follow up period, 25/123 (20.3%) patients relapsed and 9/123
      (7.3%) died. CST6 was methylated in cfDNA of 13/25 (52%) patients that relapsed
      and in 3/9 (33.3%) patients that died. CONCLUSIONS: CST6 promoter is highly
      methylated in cfDNA of breast cancer patients, but not in healthy individuals.
      CST6 promoter methylation in cfDNA, should be prospectively validated as a novel 
      plasma tumor biomarker for breast cancer in a large cohort of breast cancer
      patients.

LID - 10.1111/cbdd.12060 [doi]
AB  - We demonstrate the effects on membrane of the tubulin-binding chemotherapy drugs:
      thiocolchicoside and taxol. Electrophysiology recordings across lipid membranes
      in aqueous phases containing drugs were used to investigate the drug effects on
      membrane conductance. Molecular dynamics simulation of the chemotherapy
      drug-lipid complexes was used to elucidate the mechanism at an atomistic level.
      Both drugs are observed to induce stable ion-flowing pores across membranes.
      Discrete pore current-time plots exhibit triangular conductance events in
      contrast to rectangular ones found for ion channels. Molecular dynamics
      simulations indicate that drugs and lipids experience electrostatic and van der
      Waals interactions for short periods of time when found within each other's
      proximity. The energies from these two interactions are found to be similar to
      the energies derived theoretically using the screened Coulomb and the van der
      Waals interactions between peptides and lipids due to mainly their charge
      properties while forming peptide-induced ion channels in lipid bilayers.
      Experimental and in silico studies together suggest that the chemotherapy drugs
      induce ion pores inside lipid membranes due to drug-lipid physical interactions. 
      The findings reveal cytotoxic effects of drugs on the cell membrane, which may
      aid in novel drug development for treatment of cancer and other diseases.

TI  - Copper, zinc, and Cu/Zn ratio in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.
PG  - 342-7
LID - 10.1159/000341976 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many epidemiological and experimental studies report a strong role 
      of chemical carcinogens in the etiology of bladder cancer. However, involvement
      of trace elements in the tumorigenesis of transitional cell carcinoma of the
      bladder has been poorly investigated. The aim of this study was to examine the
      relationship between zinc, copper and bladder cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Zinc
      and copper concentration and Cu/Zn ratio in two 36-sample series of bladder
      cancer tissue and sera from patients with this neoplasm were matched with those
      of the control group. The amount of trace elements in every tissue sample was
      determined using atomic absorption spectrometry. This was correlated with tumor
      stage. RESULTS: While the copper concentrations reached statistically higher
      values in the bladder cancer tissue, the zinc levels in the sera and bladder
      tissue of the patients with this carcinoma were substantially lower as compared
      to those of the control group. The serum Cu/Zn ratio was significantly higher in 
      the bladder cancer group and this increase was greater in the patients with
      muscle-invasive neoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained suggest a
      relationship between trace elements and the bladder cancer.

AB  - Malfunction or overexpression of ErbB receptors (epidermal growth factor
      receptors) is associated with occurrence and severity of several types of cancer.
      Initiation of signal cascades by ErbB2 (also known as human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2/neu) in breast cancer has been blocked by monoclonal antibodies
      such as Trastuzumab (Herceptin), which interact with the extracellular domain of 
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Due to some disadvantages of monoclonal
      antibodies, a new approach in blocking human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      dimerization and activation is designing peptidomimetic ligands based on human
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2-Trastuzumab interaction model. Growth of human
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2(+) SK-BR3 cells could be specifically
      inhibited by peptidomimetic herceptin-based peptidomimetic 5. In this study,
      herceptin-based peptidomimetic 5 was used as a benchmark peptidomimetic compound 
      to perform a ligand-based virtual screening followed by structure-based screening
      by applying the molecular docking approach. The study aimed to explore more
      potent peptidomimetic molecules against extracellular part of human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2. Our results showed that the newly designed
      peptidomimetic herceptin-based peptidomimetic n33B in comparison with
      herceptin-based peptidomimetic 5 binds more tightly to the extracellular domain
      of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Mechanistic aspects of
      herceptin-based peptidomimetic n33B interaction with human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 were more investigated through 20-ns molecular dynamic
      simulations. Additionally, a quantitative structure-activity relationships study 
      was performed to develop a model for identification of structural determinants in
      herceptin-based peptidomimetic 5-based peptidomimetics.

      mutational progression of melanoma.
PG  - 505
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-13-505 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metastasis is characterized by spreading of neoplastic cells to an
      organ other than where they originated and is the predominant cause of death
      among cancer patients. This holds true for melanoma, whose incidence is
      increasing more rapidly than any other cancer and once disseminated has few
      therapeutic options. Here we performed whole exome sequencing of two sets of
      matched normal and metastatic tumor DNAs. RESULTS: Using stringent criteria, we
      evaluated the similarities and differences between the lesions. We find that in
      both cases, 96% of the single nucleotide variants are shared between the two
      metastases indicating that clonal populations gave rise to the distant
      metastases. Analysis of copy number variation patterns of both metastatic sets
      revealed a trend similar to that seen with our single nucleotide variants.
      Analysis of pathway enrichment on tumor sets shows commonly mutated pathways
      enriched between individual sets of metastases and all metastases combined.
      CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a proof-of-concept suggesting that individual
      metastases may have sufficient similarity for successful targeting of driver
      mutations.

TI  - CA125 reference values change in male and postmenopausal female subjects.
PG  - 413-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: In cancer patients, including women with a diagnosis of ovarian
      cancer, cancer antigen 125 (CA125) is used to evaluate the presence of peritoneal
      involvement. The aims of the present study were to assess CA125 reference
      intervals and reference change values (RCV) in postmenopausal reference women,
      postmenopausal women breast cancer free, reference men and cancer free men.
      METHODS: The series consisted of 433 subjects: 105 postmenopausal breast cancer
      free women and 56 cancer free men in addition to a total of 272 reference
      subjects (145 postmenopausal women and 127 men). Repeated CA125 measurements were
      made in a subset of 149 women and 54 men to calculate RCV and index of
      individuality. Serum CA125 levels were evaluated by a chemiluminescent assay.
      RESULTS: In postmenopausal reference women, the mean CA125 value and 2.5th-97.5th
      percentiles were 6.70, 2.60-11.00 kU/L, respectively, with a unidirectional RCV
      of 38.4%. In postmenopausal breast cancer free women, the mean CA125 value and
      2.5th-97.5th percentile were 7.45, 4.09-10.92 kU/L, respectively, with a RCV of
      34.5%. The difference between the means was statistically significant (t=-3.02,
      p=0.003). In the two male subgroups, the difference between the means for CA125
      was not statistically significant (t=0.43, p=0.665). On considering the entire
      male population, the mean CA125 value and 2.5th-97.5th percentiles were 7.50 and 
      2.40-13.2 kU/L, respectively, while the unidirectional RCV was 34.3%. In all the 
      studied groups, the indices of individuality were equal to or below 0.6.
      CONCLUSIONS: The extremely low index of individuality found underlines the
      importance of using the RCV instead of absolute values as a parameter when
      interpreting the CA125 data in the monitoring and follow-up of patients with
      ovarian cancer.

TI  - Paris saponin II of Rhizoma Paridis--a novel inducer of apoptosis in human
      ovarian cancer cells.
PG  - 201-11
AB  - Rhizoma Paridis (dried root and rhizome) has been an essential ingredient in
      traditional Chinese herbal medicine. In the past decade, active components of
      Rhizoma Paridis - the Paris saponins have emerged as promising anti-cancer
      agents. Among these saponins, polyphyllin D (Paris saponin (PS) I), has been
      extensively studied and proposed to be a potent antitumor agent. In this study,
      we continue to establish the efficacy and mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic
      effects of the steroidal PS members, namely formosanin C (PSII) in ovarian cancer
      treatment. We isolated PSII and evaluated its effects on a panel of ten human
      cell lines. Isolated PSII has potent inhibitory effects on the growth of tumor
      cells without deleterious effects to different normal cell types or benign
      neoplastic derived cells. While PSII, PSI, and etoposide are effective promoting 
      agents for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, PSII appeared to be marginally more
      potent than the later two in inhibiting SKOV3 cell growth. In PSII-treated SKOV3 
      cells, there was an elevation in proapoptotic elements including Bax, cytosolic
      cytochrome c, activated-caspase-3, and activated-caspase-9. The treatment also
      reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) phosphorylation and
      anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression. We also assessed the antitumor efficacy of
      intraperitoneal administration of PSII in human SKOV3 ovarian cancer xenografts
      in athymic mice. PSII treatment significantly inhibited the growth of xenograft
      tumors relative to controls by 70% (p < 0.05). These findings demonstrated that, 
      in addition to the unique selectivity against cancer cells, PSII is a potent
      antitumor molecule that may be developed as a cancer therapeutic agent.

TI  - Validity of laparoscopic staging to avoid adjuvant chemoradiation following
      radical surgery in patients with early cervical cancer.
PG  - 346-53
LID - 10.1159/000341659 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the rate of unavoidable adjuvant chemoradiation (RCTX) due 
      to histologic results after radical surgery in patients with early cervical
      cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 2004 and July 2011, 448 consecutive
      patients diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer stage IA1 L1 to IIA underwent
      laparoscopic staging at the Department of Gynecology and Gynecologic Oncology at 
      Charite Berlin. Only in patients without lymph node metastases (n = 394) on
      frozen section, radical operation was continued either by laparoscopic radical
      hysterectomy (n = 228) or by radical vaginal trachelectomy (n = 166). The
      decision for adjuvant RCTX was reached among the members of an interdisciplinary 
      tumor board according to the presence of risk factors. The mean age of patients
      was 39 years. Squamous cell cancer was found in 62.5%, adenocarcinoma in 32.7%,
      adenosquamous cancer in 3.8% and others in 1% of patients. Adjuvant treatment was
      indicated if at least one category 1 risk factor (pN1, R1 or RX, parametrial
      involvement) and/or any combination of category 2 risk factors (lymphovascular
      space involvement (LVSI), hemovascular space involvement, grading 3, young age,
      deep stromal invasion, large tumor size) were present. RESULTS: In 39 of 394
      patients (9.9%), adjuvant RCTX was recommended due to category 1 risk factors (n 
      = 25/6.4%) and category 2 risk factors (n = 14/3.5%). Tumor-involved (R0) or
      unclear resection margins (RX) were present in 4 (1%) and 1 (0.3%), parametrial
      involvement in 12 (3%) and positive lymph nodes in 11 (2.8%) patients,
      respectively. Hemovascular involvement was found in 14 (3.5%), LVSI in 113
      (28.7%) and grading 3 in 122 (31%) patients, respectively. CONCLUSION:
      Laparoscopic staging is a reliable tool to keep the rate of tri-modal (surgery + 
      chemotherapy + radiotherapy) treatments in patients with cervical cancer stage I 
      and IIA after radical surgery at 10%. This percentage should be used as benchmark
      for the quality of interdisciplinary treatment of patients diagnosed with
      cervical cancer.

TI  - Research progress in the radioprotective effect of superoxide dismutase.
PG  - 169-77
AB  - Irradiation from diverse sources is ubiquitous and closely associated with human 
      activity. Radiation therapy (RT), an important component of the multiple
      radiation origins, contributes significantly to oncotherapy by killing tumor
      cells. On the other hand, RT can also cause some undesired normal tissue injuries
      that afflict numerous cancer patients. Although many promising radioprotective
      agents are emerging, few of them have entered the market successfully due to
      various limitations. At present, the most accepted hypothesis for the
      radiation-caused injury involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.
      Superoxide dismutase (SOD), the unique enzyme responsible for the dismutation of 
      superoxide radicals, is expected to occupy an indispensable position in the
      treatment of ROS-mediated tissue injuries originating from exposure to radiation.
      This review focuses on the mechanism of radioprotection by SOD at the tissue or
      organ level, cellular level, and molecular level, respectively, in order to
      provide references for further investigation of radiation injury and development 
      of new radioprotectors.

TI  - Optimization of cell-wall skeleton derived from Mycobacterium bovis BCG Tokyo 172
      (SMP-105) emulsion in delayed-type hypersensitivity and antitumor models.
PG  - 218-25
AB  - Cell-wall skeleton prepared from Mycobacterium bovis BCG (BCG-CWS) is known as a 
      potent adjuvant and has been shown to possess antitumor activity in many
      non-clinical and clinical studies. As there are no approved BCG-CWS formulations 
      for cancer therapy, we investigated the potential for cancer immunotherapy of
      SMP-105, our originally produced BCG-CWS. For optimizing SMP-105 emulsion, we
      compared the effects of drakeoland squalane-based SMP-105 emulsions on IFN-gamma 
      production in rats and evaluated their ability to induce skin reaction in guinea 
      pigs. Both emulsions had the same activity in both experiments. We selected
      squalane as base material and produced two types of squalane-based formulations
      (vialed emulsion and pumped emulsion) that can easily be prepared as oil-in-water
      emulsions. Although the vialed emulsion showed the same pattern of distribution
      as a usual homogenized emulsion, the pumped emulsion showed more uniform
      distribution than the other two emulsions. Whereas both emulsions enhanced strong
      delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction in a mouse model, the pumped
      emulsion induced slightly smaller edema. Data on oil droplet size distribution
      suggest that few micrometer oil droplet size might be appropriate for
      oil-in-water microemulsion of SMP-105. The antitumor potency of SMP-105 emulsion 
      was stronger than that of some of the launched toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists 
      (Aldara cream, Picibanil, and Immunobladder). Aldara and Picibanil showed limited
      antitumor effectiveness, while Immunobladder had almost the same effect as
      SMP-105 at the highest dose, but needed about 10 times the amount of SMP-105.
      These findings first indicate that SMP-105 has great potential in cancer
      immunotherapy.

PG  - 305-16
LID - 10.1159/000342523 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The long-term effects of biocompatible peritoneal dialysis (PD) 
      solution on residual renal function (RRF), inflammation, adipokines and metabolic
      acidosis are controversial. We evaluated the effects of biocompatible PD solution
      in continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) patients for an additional 12-month period.
      METHOD: Among 91 incident patients who started CAPD with either biocompatible PD 
      solution (Balance(R), Fresenius; LS, n = 48) or conventional PD solution
      (CAPD/DPCA(R), Fresenius; CS, n = 43), 63 patients, who were followed for 12
      months, were enrolled and followed for an additional 12 months. RESULTS: After 24
      months of treatment, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of the LS group was
      twofold higher compared to the CS group (33.5 +/- 30.7 vs. 16.3 +/- 17.9
      l/week/1.73 m(2), respectively, p = 0.021). In a subgroup of patients with an
      initial GFR >2 ml/min/1.73 m(2), the GFR of the LS group was significantly higher
      than the rate of the CS group after 24 months (43.7 +/- 30.5 vs. 18.6 +/- 19.0
      l/week/1.73 m(2), respectively, p = 0.042). Over a 24-month period, effluent
      cancer antigen-125 levels were significantly increased in the LS group compared
      to the CS group, while effluent interleukin-6 levels did not differ between the
      two groups. The serum tCO(2) levels were consistently higher in the LS group
      compared to the CS group. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the effect of LS on
      preserving RRF may be maintained over a 24-month treatment period in CAPD
      patients, and LS use may have other benefits, such as the correction of metabolic
      acidosis.

TI  - Body mass index and renal cell cancer: the influence of race and sex.
PG  - 821-8
LID - 10.1097/EDE.0b013e31826b7fe9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is a risk factor for renal cell (or renal) cancer. The
      increasing prevalence of obesity may be contributing to the rising incidence of
      this cancer over the past several decades. The effects of early-age obesity and
      change in body mass index (BMI) on renal cancer have been studied less
      thoroughly, and the influence of race has never been formally investigated.
      METHODS: Using data gathered as part of a large case-control study of renal
      cancer (1214 cases and 1234 controls), we investigated associations with BMI at
      several time points, as well as with height. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95%
      confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using logistic regression modeling.
      Race- and sex-stratified analyses were conducted to evaluate subgroup
      differences. RESULTS: Obesity (BMI >/= 30 kg/m) early in adulthood (OR = 1.6 [95%
      CI = 1.1 to 2.4]) and 5 years before diagnosis (1.6 [1.1 to 2.2]) was associated 
      with renal cancer. The association with early-adult obesity was stronger among
      whites than blacks (test for interaction, P = 0.006), whereas the association
      with obesity near diagnosis was marginally stronger in women than men (test for
      interaction, P = 0.08). The strongest association with renal cancer was observed 
      for obese whites both in early adulthood and before interview (2.6 [1.5 to 4.4]);
      this association was not present among blacks. Estimates of the annual excess
      rate of renal cancer (per 100,000 persons) attributed to both overweight and
      obesity (BMI > 25 kg/m) ranged from 9.9 among black men to 5.6 among white women.
      CONCLUSION: Obesity, both early and later in life, is associated with an
      increased risk of renal cancer. The association with early obesity seems to be
      stronger among whites than blacks.

TI  - Regression models for the effects of exposure rate and cumulative exposure.
PG  - 892-9
LID - 10.1097/EDE.0b013e31826c3149 [doi]
AB  - Epidemiologic studies that collect detailed exposure histories often incorporate 
      this information into a regression model through a time-dependent cumulative
      exposure metric. This summary metric obscures variations in exposure rates among 
      people and within persons over time. To disentangle the effects of cumulative
      exposure and exposure rate, one standard approach is to simultaneously model both
      cumulative exposure and average exposure rate. We propose an alternative
      regression model that uses a person's detailed exposure history information to
      describe the effect of the history of exposure increments on the relative hazard 
      function. We illustrate this approach using data from a cohort study of radon
      exposure and lung cancer mortality among uranium miners. Compared with a standard
      cumulative exposure-average exposure rate model, our proposed approach yielded
      somewhat stronger evidence that the radon-lung cancer mortality association is
      modified by exposure rate. At low exposure rates, the estimated excess relative
      hazard per 100 working-level months was 0.63 (95% confidence interval =
      0.32-1.37) under the standard approach, whereas under the proposed approach it
      was 1.23 (0.53-3.76). The proposed approach may provide better understanding of
      relationships between a protracted exposure and disease and is readily
      implemented using existing statistical software.

TI  - Pulmonary imaging with a scanning acoustic microscope discriminates
      speed-of-sound and shows structural characteristics of disease.

LID - 10.1038/labinvest.2012.135 [doi]
AB  - Tissue elasticity can be detected using a scanning acoustic microscope (SAM),
      whereby acoustic images are created from the speed of sound through tissues. This
      system discriminated pulmonary tissue components and demonstrated distinct
      acoustic images of the lung; these results corresponded well to those obtained
      using the conventional microscope. SAM provides the following benefits: (1)
      images are acquired in only few minutes without requirement for staining, (2)
      basic data is obtained for low-frequency ultrasonic examination, and (3) speed of
      sound from each lesion is digital and comparable among diseases. Comparative
      analysis of cancer invasion, post-inflammatory fibrosis, and deposition disease
      was possible using the data obtained with the system, and the results showed good
      correlation with those using the conventional microscope and by clinical
      diagnosis. The SAM system is applicable not only to pulmonary diseases but also
      to various diseases in other organs.

TI  - Hepatic arterial infusion with irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and floxuridine plus
      systemic chemotherapy as first-line treatment of unresectable liver metastases
      from colorectal cancer.
PG  - 480-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and
      safety of hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) with irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and
      floxuridine as a firstline treatment in patients with unresectable liver
      metastases of colorectal cancer (CRC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individual patients 
      were treated with irinotecan (120 mg/m(2)), oxaliplatin (100 mg/m(2)), and
      floxuridine (500 mg/m(2)) via tumorsupplying arteries. Intravenous leucovorin
      (200 mg/day) and floxuridine (300 mg/m(2)/day) were given on days 1-3 after the
      procedure. The therapeutic courses were repeated every 4-8 weeks. Tumor
      responses, overall survival, and the time to tumor progression were observed.
      RESULTS: 204 cumulative cycles of chemotherapy were performed for 31 patients
      (median 7.0). 19 patients achieved a partial response; in 10 patients the disease
      stabilized, and in 2 patients the disease progressed, producing an overall
      response rate of 61.3%. The median survival time was 24.8 months, and the median 
      time to tumor progression was 10.1 months. Frequencies of grade 3-4 neutropenia, 
      diarrhea, elevation of serum bilirubin, elevation of serum transaminases, and
      vomiting were 6.5, 9.7, 3.2, 19.4, and 90.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This
      triplecombination chemotherapy as firstline treatment through HAI was well
      tolerated and effective in patients with unresectable liver metastases of CRC.

TI  - Mitomycin C in combination with vinorelbine in anthracycline- and/or
      taxane-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer.
PG  - 500-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with disease progression
      after anthracycline-and/or taxane-containing therapy need an effective drug
      regimen with low toxicity. Mitomycin C (MMC) and vinorelbine (VNR) are suitable
      candidates for combination therapy in the second-/third-line treatment of MBC.
      This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of an MMC/VNR combination
      chemotherapy in pretreated patients with MBC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a phase II
      trial, patients with anthracycline-and/or taxane-pretreated MBC were treated with
      MMC 8 mg/m(2) (day 1) and VNR 25 mg/m(2) (days 1 and 8) every 4 weeks for up to 6
      cycles or until disease progression. RESULTS: In 51 eligible patients, 13 (26%)
      partial remissions (PRs), 20 (39%) stable diseases (SDs) and 18 (35%) progressive
      diseases (PDs) were observed. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.0 
      months. The main grade 3/4 toxicities were neutrocytopenia (41%),
      granulocytopenia (37%), and thrombocytopenia (4%). Other hematological and
      non-hematological toxicities were mostly mild. CONCLUSION: The combination of MMC
      and VNR is an effective and relatively well-tolerated regimen for anthracycline- 
      and/or taxane-pretreated patients with MBC and is suitable for outpatient
      therapy.

TI  - Combination of trastuzumab and triple FLOT chemotherapy
      (5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel) in patients with
      HER2-positive metastatic gastric cancer: report of 3 cases.
PG  - 505-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab in combination with doublet chemotherapy (cisplatin and
      fluoropyrimidine) is a standard treatment for patients with HER2-positive
      advanced gastric cancer. There have been no studies evaluating trastuzumab with
      more intensive triplet chemotherapy regimens in this setting. We report the
      treatment outcome in 3 patients with HER2-positive metastatic gastric cancer who 
      were treated with trastuzumab plus the triplet FLOT regimen
      (5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 3 
      patients with HER2-positive metastatic gastric cancer received trastuzumab plus
      FLOT. Trastuzumab 4 mg/kg was given with the 2nd chemotherapy cycle and was
      continued at 2 mg/kg every week with subsequent cycles. RESULTS: All 3 patients
      had a dismal prognosis because of their heavy disease burden, most notably
      extensive hepatic metastatic involvement. Patients tolerated the triple-drug plus
      trastuzumab combination well. All patients exhibited a dramatic clinical
      response. CONCLUSION: This report provides the first evidence that the addition
      of trastuzumab to a docetaxel-based, triple-drug chemotherapy combination is
      feasible and highly active in patients with HER2-positive metastatic gastric
      cancer.

      cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gefitinib-induced hepatotoxicity has been
      underappreciated and rarely reported. CASE REPORT: The medical records of 92
      NSCLC patients, who were admitted to our cancer center in the past 5 years, were 
      reviewed retrospectively. All patients received treatment with gefitinib (250
      mg/day), during which liver function was monitored. Of the 92 NSCLC patients, 6
      (6.5%) developed mild to moderate hepatotoxicity during gefitinib treatment. The 
      time of onset of hepatotoxicity ranged from 7 days to 6 months after gefitinib
      administration. 1 patient (1.1%) suffered from grade 2 hepatotoxicity, and
      gradually recovered her normal liver function after reduction of the gefitinib
      dose. The other 5 patients with grade 1 hepatic impairment tolerated gefitinib
      well without requiring dose reductions or drug cessation. CONCLUSION:
      Gefitinib-induced hepatotoxicity is not uncommon. Although the extent of this
      toxicity is generally mild in nature and most patients tolerate gefitinib well,
      meticulous monitoring is mandatory to avoid severe hepatic impairment.

TI  - IkappaB kinase epsilon phosphorylates TRAF2 to promote mammary epithelial cell
      transformation.
PG  - 4756-68
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00468-12 [doi]
AB  - NF-kappaB transcription factors are central regulators of inflammation and when
      dysregulated contribute to malignant transformation. IkappaB kinase epsilon
      (IKKepsilon; IKKi, encoded by IKBKE) is a breast oncogene that is amplified in
      30% of breast cancers and drives transformation in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner.
      Here we demonstrate that IKKepsilon interacts with and phosphorylates tumor
      necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) at Ser11 in vitro and in
      vivo. This activity promotes Lys63-linked TRAF2 ubiquitination and NF-kappaB
      activation and is essential for IKKepsilon transformation. Breast cancer cells
      that depend on IKKepsilon expression for survival are also dependent on TRAF2.
      This work defines TRAF2 phosphorylation to be one key effector of
      IKKepsilon-induced mammary epithelial cell transformation.

TI  - Review of exercise studies in breast cancer survivors: attention to principles of
      exercise training.
PG  - 909-16
LID - 10.1136/bjsm.2010.082719 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Research supports the use of exercise to improve quality of life and 
      reduce the side effects of breast cancer treatment, such as fatigue and decreased
      aerobic capacity. Previously published reviews have focused on reporting the
      outcomes of exercise interventions, but have not critically examined the exercise
      prescriptions. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the application of the
      principles of exercise training in the exercise prescriptions reported in
      intervention studies for breast cancer survivors. METHODS: Databases were
      searched for randomised controlled trials of exercise in women diagnosed with
      breast cancer. Data were extracted to evaluate the application of the principles 
      of exercise training, the reporting of the components of the exercise
      prescription and the reporting of adherence to the exercise prescription.
      RESULTS: Of the 29 papers included, none applied all principles of exercise
      training. Specificity was applied by 64%, progression by 41%, overload by 31%,
      initial values by 62% and diminishing returns and reversibility by 7% of trials. 
      No study reported all components of the exercise prescription. CONCLUSION: The
      application of the principles of exercise training varied greatly, and reporting 
      of the exercise prescribed and completed was incomplete. When principles of
      exercise training are applied to the development of exercise protocols, there is 
      greater confidence that non-significant findings reflect lack of efficacy of
      exercise rather than deficiencies in the prescription. Incomplete reporting of
      the exercise prescription and adherence to the prescription limits the
      reproducibility of the intervention, and the ability to determine the dose of
      exercise received by participants.

TI  - Immunoglobulin g from breast cancer patients regulates MCF-7 cells migration and 
      MMP-9 activity by stimulating muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
PG  - 427-35
LID - 10.1007/s10875-012-9804-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We have previously reported the expression of muscarinic acetylcholine
      receptors (mAChR) in human breast tumors. The activation of these receptors
      triggered tumor cell proliferation. Considering that invasion and metastasis is
      the major cause of death in cancer, we investigated the action of autoantibodies 
      against mAChR derived from breast cancer patients in stage I (T1N0Mx-IgG) on
      MCF-7 cells migration and metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity. We also analyzed 
      the participation of phospholipase C/nitric oxide synthase/protein kinase C
      pathway. METHODS: Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was purified by chromatography in
      protein G-agarose from blood samples of breast cancer patients obtained under
      informed consent. Migration was assayed by an in vitro wound assay. MMP-9
      activity was quantified by zymography. RESULTS: T1N0Mx-IgG promoted tumor cell
      migration and increased MMP9 activity mimicking the action of the muscarinic
      agonist carbachol. This effect was reduced not only by the presence of atropine
      but also by 4-DAMP or tropicamide, antagonists for M(3) and M(4) mAChR subtypes
      respectively. The actions of T1N0Mx-IgG and carbachol on MCF-7 cells, involved
      the participation of phospholipase C/nitric oxide synthase/protein kinase C
      pathway. CONCLUSIONS: IgG from breast cancer patients in stage I could be
      promoting tumor progression by regulating migration and MMP-9 activity in tumor
      cells via mAChR activation. The presence of these autoantibodies could be
      determining the prognosis of breast cancer in these patients.

TI  - Stereotactic body radiotherapy treatment of extracranial metastases.
PG  - 654-65
LID - 10.1038/nrclinonc.2012.166 [doi]
AB  - Radiotherapy is an integral treatment for patients with metastatic cancer,
      although it is usually reserved for palliation of pain, dyspnoea, oedema,
      bleeding and neurological symptoms. However, the administration of high-precision
      radiotherapy, termed stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), has the potential to 
      significantly affect the disease course for some patients with metastatic cancer 
      by delivering high doses of radiation to the secondary tumours with limited
      high-dose delivery to adjacent healthy tissues. Indeed, such accurate delivery
      has been firmly established as a therapy for medically inoperable early-stage
      non-small-cell lung cancer. To date, the technique has demonstrated improvements 
      in controlling metastasis and, in some cases, improved palliation compared with
      conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. Active areas of research in SBRT
      include patient selection for curative intent, optimization of SBRT planning
      techniques, dosing schema and integration of SBRT into systemic therapies. Given 
      the improvements in cytotoxic and targeted therapies over the past decade,
      studies testing the careful integration of SBRT into standard systemic therapy
      regimens are needed. Further investigations are also needed to understand the
      basic biological mechanisms underlying SBRT because they are likely to be
      different to those mechanisms in conventional radiotherapy.

TI  - Snake venom toxin from Vipera lebetina turanica sensitizes cancer cells to TRAIL 
      through ROS- and JNK-mediated upregulation of death receptors and downregulation 
      of survival proteins.
PG  - 1316-26
LID - 10.1007/s10495-012-0759-5 [doi]
AB  - We investigated whether snake venom toxin (SVT) from Vipera lebetina turanica
      enhances the apoptosis ability of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related
      apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in cancer cells. TRAIL inhibited HCT116 cell
      growth in a dose-dependent manner; however, this reduction did not occur in TRAIL
      resistant HT-29, A549 and HepG2 cells with an even higher dose of TRAIL. SVT, but
      not TRAIL enhanced expression of cell death receptor (DR) in TRAIL resistant
      cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. A combination of SVT with TRAIL
      significantly inhibited cell growth of TRAIL resistant HT-29, A549 and HepG2
      cells. Consistent with cell growth inhibition, the expression of TRAIL receptors;
      DR4 and DR5 was significantly increased as well as apoptosis related proteins
      such as cleaved caspase-3, -8, -9 and Bax. However, the expression of survival
      proteins (e.g., cFLIP, survivin, XIAP and Bcl2) was suppressed by the combination
      treatment of SVT and TRAIL. Depletion of DR4 or DR5 by small interfering RNA
      significantly reversed the cell growth inhibitory and apoptosis blocking effects 
      of SVT in HCT116 and HT-29 cells. Pretreatment with the c-Jun N-terminal kinase
      (JNK) inhibitor SP600125 and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger
      N-acetylcysteine reduced the SVT and TRAIL-induced upregulation of DR4 and DR5
      expression, expression of the apoptosis related protein such as caspase-3 and-9, 
      as well as cell growth inhibitory effects. The collective results suggest that
      SVT facilitates TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cancer cells through up-regulation of 
      the TRAIL receptors; DR4 and DR5 via ROS/JNK pathway signals.

TI  - Significance of the inflammation-based Glasgow prognostic score for short- and
      long-term outcomes after curative resection of gastric cancer.
PG  - 2037-44

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Glasgow prognostic score (GPS) is a patient-related measure to
      determine long-term outcomes in cancer patients. This study examined the impact
      of GPS on outcomes including postoperative complications after curative resection
      of gastric cancer. METHODS: The systemic inflammatory response was assessed by
      GPS, and the severity of postoperative complications was evaluated according to
      the Clavien-Dindo classification. Survival analysis was performed by the
      Kaplan-Meier method and the log rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed to
      determine significant associations with complications by a logistic regression
      model and the independent prognostic values by Cox's proportional hazards model. 
      RESULTS: Study patients (n = 1017) were allocated as follows: 904 (88.9 %) to GPS
      0, 92 (9.0 %) to GPS 1, and 21 (2.1 %) to GPS 2. One hundred sixty-three patients
      (16.0 %) had postoperative complications of >/= grade 2. Multivariate logistic
      analysis identified gender, body mass index, tumor location, tumor depth, blood
      transfusion, and comorbidity as significantly correlated with postoperative
      complications. However, GPS was not associated with the incidence of
      complication. On the other hand, multivariate analysis for overall survival
      identified GPS as an independent prognostic factor. CONCLUSIONS: GPS is a
      significant predictor of long-term survival in curable gastric cancer surgery but
      not of short-term outcomes.

TI  - Localization of decorin gene expression in normal human breast tissue and in
      benign and malignant tumors of the human breast.
PG  - 161-71

AB  - The small extracellular matrix proteoglycan decorin which possesses a potent
      antitumor activity has been shown to be present in various amounts in the stroma 
      of several tumors including those of the breast. Regarding decorin in breast
      malignancies the published data are conflicting, i.e., whether breast cancer
      cells express it or not. Here, we first compared decorin gene expression levels
      between healthy human breast tissue and selected types of human breast cancer
      using GeneSapiens databank. Next, we localized decorin mRNA in tissue specimen of
      normal human breast, intraductal breast papillomas and various histologic types
      of human breast cancer using in situ hybridization (ISH) with digoxigenin-labeled
      RNA probes for decorin. We also examined the effect of decorin transduction on
      the behavior of cultured human breast cancer MCF7 cells. Analysis of GeneSapiens 
      databank revealed that in various human breast cancers decorin expression is
      significant. However, ISH results clearly demonstrated that human breast cancer
      cells independently of the type of the cancer do not express decorin mRNA. This
      was also true for papilloma-forming cells of the human breast. Indeed, decorin
      gene expression in healthy human breast tissue as well as in benign and malignant
      tumors of human breast was shown to take place solely in cells of the original
      stroma. Decorin transduction using decorin adenoviral vector in decorin-negative 
      MCF7 cells resulted in a significant decrease in the proliferation of these cells
      and changed cell cohesion. Decorin-transduced MCF7 cells also exhibited increased
      apoptosis. In conclusion, our study shows that in human breast tissue only cells 
      of the original stroma are capable of decorin gene expression. Our study also
      shows that transduction of decorin in decorin-negative human breast cancer cells 
      markedly modulates the growth pattern of these cells.

TI  - Feasibility of intraoperative radiation therapy for early breast cancer in Japan:
      a single-center pilot study and literature review.
PG  - 415-22
LID - 10.1007/s12282-012-0412-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) is under evaluation in
      breast-conserving surgery because the feasibility of the IORT procedure including
      transportation of the patient under general anesthesia is not well established.
      Thus, this prospective single-center study aimed to test the feasibility of IORT 
      at a single dose of 21 Gy in Japanese breast cancer patients. METHODS: The
      primary endpoint was early toxicity; the secondary endpoint was late toxicity.
      Patients with histologically or cytologically proven primary early breast cancer 
      were eligible. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) T < 2.5 cm; (2) desire for
      breast-conserving surgery; (3) age >50 years; (4) surgical margin >1 cm; (5)
      intraoperative pathologically free margins; and (6) sentinel node negative.
      Exclusion criteria were (1) contraindications to radiation therapy; (2) past
      radiation therapy for the same breast or chest; (3) extensive intraductal
      component; and (4) a tumor located in the axillary tail of the breast. All
      patients gave written informed consent. Partial resection was performed with at
      least a margin of 1 cm around the tumor. The patient was transported from the
      surgical suite to the radiation room. Radiation (Clinac((R)) 21EX, Varian Medical
      Systems, Inc.) at 21 Gy was delivered directly to the mammary gland. Toxicity was
      evaluated with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V4.0. RESULTS: 
      Five patients were enrolled in this pilot study and received 21 Gy. Follow-up
      ranged from 7.8 to 11.0 months (median 10.2). Intraoperative transportation to
      the radiation room during the surgical procedure under general anesthesia was
      performed safely in all patients. Treatment-related toxicities within 3 months
      were deep connective tissue fibrosis (grade 1, n = 3) and pain (grade 1, n = 3). 
      There was no case of wound infection, wound dehiscence, or soft tissue necrosis. 
      Overall, there was no severe adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: The procedure was
      tolerated very well in this first group of Japanese female patients treated with 
      IORT, as was the case with European women. A longer follow-up is needed for the
      evaluation of any potential late side effects or recurrences. A phase II study is
      now being conducted for the next group of patients (UMIN000003578).

TI  - CD151 promotes cancer cell metastasis via integrins alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta1
      in vitro.

AB  - CD151 is a member of the tetraspanin family that is implicated as a promoter of
      the tumor metastasis of malignant cells. Tetraspanins form membrane complexes
      with integrins. In the present study, we constructed a CD151-AAA mutant to assess
      the roles of Rac, cdc42 and phospho-Rac/cdc42 (P-Rac/cdc42) and the effects of
      CD151integrin complexes on the proliferation, migration and invasion of HepG2
      cells. The pAAV-CD151 and pAAVCD151AAA mutant plasmids were constructed and used 
      to transiently transfect HepG2 cells using the Qiagen Attractene transfection
      reagent. Following transfection, the expression of CD151 was determined by
      western blotting. A cell proliferation assay was performed using the cell
      counting kit-8 (CCK-8) method, cell migration was assessed by a cell
      wound-healing assay and cell invasion was evaluated in microchemotaxis chambers
      using FBS as the chemotactic stimulus. The potential involvement of various
      signaling pathways was explored using relevant antibodies. The association
      between CD151 and integrins was evaluated by immunoblotting analysis. We found
      that CD151 promoted cell proliferation, migration and chemotaxis and increased
      P-Rac/cdc42 activity. The CD151-AAA mutant had reduced cellular proliferation,
      migration and invasion compared with the CD151 mutant. Moreover, the CD151-AAA
      mutant abrogated the association between CD151 and integrins. These data suggest 
      that CD151 forms complexes by interacting with integrins, particularly
      alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta1, and thereby affects the functioning of the HepG2
      cells. The mechanism is possibly related to the Rac, cdc42 and P-Rac/cdc42
      signaling pathways.

TI  - Epidermal growth factor (EGF) regulates alpha5beta1 integrin activation state in 
      human cancer cell lines through the p90RSK-dependent phosphorylation of filamin
      A.
PG  - 40371-80
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M112.389577 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Regulation of integrin activation has important implications for
      tumor cell invasion and metastasis. RESULTS: EGF activates ERK/p90RSK and Rho/Rho
      kinase signaling in A431 and DiFi colon cancer cells, leading to phosphorylation 
      of filamin A (FLNa) and inactivation of the alpha5beta1 integrin receptor.
      CONCLUSION: EGF promotes alpha5beta1 inactivation through the p90RSK-dependent
      phosphorylation of FLNa. SIGNIFICANCE: We have identified a novel EGF-dependent
      mechanism controlling the alpha5beta1 integrin activation state. Cell adhesion,
      motility, and invasion are regulated by the ligand-binding activity of integrin
      receptors, transmembrane proteins that bind to the extracellular matrix.
      Integrins whose conformation allows for ligand binding and appropriate functional
      activity are said to be in an active state. Integrin activation and subsequent
      ligand binding are dynamically regulated by the association of cytoplasmic
      proteins with integrin intracellular domains. In this study, we evaluated the
      role of EGF in the regulation of the activation state of the alpha5beta1 integrin
      receptor for fibronectin. The addition of EGF to either A431 squamous carcinoma
      cells or DiFi colon cancer cells resulted in loss of alpha5beta1-dependent
      adhesion to fibronectin but no loss of integrin from the cell surface. EGF
      activated the EGF receptor/ERK/p90RSK and Rho/Rho kinase signaling pathways.
      Blocking either pathway inhibited EGF-mediated loss of adhesion, suggesting that 
      they work in parallel to regulate integrin function. EGF treatment also resulted 
      in phosphorylation of filamin A (FLNa), which binds and inactivates beta1
      integrins. EGF-mediated FLNa phosphorylation was completely blocked by an
      inhibitor of p90RSK and partially attenuated by an inhibitor of Rho kinase,
      suggesting that both pathways converge on FLNa to regulate integrin function.
      A431 clonal cell lines expressing non-phosphorylated dominant-negative FLNa were 
      resistant to the inhibitory effects of EGF on integrin function, whereas clonal
      cell lines overexpressing wild-type FLNa were more sensitive to the inhibitory
      effect of EGF. These data suggest that EGF-dependent inactivation of alpha5beta1 
      integrin is regulated through FLNa phosphorylation and cellular contractility.

TI  - Decreased levels of nitric oxide production and nitric oxide synthase-2
      expression are associated with the development and metastasis of hepatocellular
      carcinoma.

AB  - Many studies have demonstrated the function of nitric oxide (NO) or nitric oxide 
      synthase-2 (NOS-2) in cancer as pro-neoplastic or anti-neoplastic effectors, but 
      the role of NO and NOS-2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The
      aim of this study was to investigate the levels of NO production and NOS-2
      expression in HCC and adjacent non-tumor liver tissues and to clarify whether the
      levels of NO/NOS-2 are related to the clinicopathological features of HCC. The
      levels of NO production were examined in tumor and adjacent non-tumor liver
      tissues of 30 patients with HCC. The expression of NOS-2 was detected by
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analysis in 
      HCC and/or adjacent non-tumor liver tissues. Mutant p53 and proliferating cell
      nuclear antigen (PCNA) were also immunohistochemically investigated in liver
      tissues. The levels of NO in HCC were significantly lower compared to adjacent
      non-tumor liver tissues (P<0.001). The relative mRNA and protein expression
      levels of NOS-2 in HCC were also significantly lower compared to adjacent
      non-tumor liver tissues (P<0.01 for both). We found that the levels of NO in
      patients suffering from HCC metastasis were lower compared to those without
      metastasis (P<0.05) and NOS-2 expression was correlated with tumor diameter
      (P<0.05) and metastasis (P<0.05). In addition, mutant p53 protein was expressed
      in the majority of HCC samples and the proliferation rate of HCC was
      significantly higher than that of adjacent non-tumor liver tissues. These data
      indicate that decreased levels of NO/NOS-2 may partially contribute to
      overexpression of the mutant p53 protein and excessive proliferation; this may be
      a potential mechanism in the development and progression of HCC.

TI  - Gemcitabine reactivates epigenetically silenced genes and functions as a DNA
      methyltransferase inhibitor.
PG  - 1505-11
LID - 10.3892/ijmm.2012.1138 [doi]
AB  - Gemcitabine is indicated in combination with cisplatin as first-line therapy for 
      solid tumours including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), bladder cancer and
      mesothelioma. Gemcitabine is an analogue of pyrimidine cytosine and functions as 
      an anti-metabolite. Structurally, however, gemcitabine has similarities to
      5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (decitabine/Dacogen(R)), a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 
      (DNMTi). NSCLC, mesothelioma and prostate cancer cell lines were treated with
      decitabine and gemcitabine. Reactivation of epigenetically silenced genes was
      examined by RT-PCR/qPCR. DNA methyltransferase activity in nuclear extracts and
      recombinant proteins was measured using a DNA methyl-transferase assay, and
      alterations in DNA methylation status were examined using methylation-specific
      PCR (MS-PCR) and pyrosequencing. We observe a reactivation of several
      epigenetically silenced genes including GSTP1, IGFBP3 and RASSF1A. Gemcitabine
      functionally inhibited DNA methyltransferase activity in both nuclear extracts
      and recombinant proteins. Gemcitabine dramatically destabilised DNMT1 protein.
      However, DNA CpG methylation was for the most part unaffected by gemcitabine. In 
      conclusion, gemcitabine both inhibits and destabilises DNA methyltransferases and
      reactivates epigenetically silenced genes having activity equivalent to
      decitabine at concentrations significantly lower than those achieved in the
      treatment of patients with solid tumours. This property may contribute to the
      anticancer activity of gemcitabine.

      health indicators and health promotion behaviors.
PG  - 53-73
LID - 10.1177/1074840712462135 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of an intervention to
      improve the health of grandmothers raising grandchildren. A pre- and post-test
      design was employed with 504 African American grandmother participants. The
      intervention included monthly home-based visitation by registered nurses (RNs)
      and social workers, participation in support groups and parenting classes,
      referrals for legal services, and early intervention services for children with
      special needs. The Health Risk Appraisal was used to assess health indicators and
      health promotion behaviors. A comparison of pre- and post-test scores indicated
      significant (p < .002) changes in the desired direction for a number of health
      indicators and health promotion behaviors, including blood pressure, annual
      routine cancer screenings, frequency of weekly exercise, and improved dietary
      intake, as well as participants' perception of their health and life
      satisfaction. No improvements were observed in the proportion of participants who
      were obese or overweight.

PG  - 163-76
LID - 10.1007/s00281-012-0344-6 [doi]
AB  - Neutrophils are primary inflammatory cells and absolutely essential to protect
      the host during the early phases of microbial infection. Their role in cancer is 
      less clear. Current evidence suggests that neutrophils show high functional
      plasticity and can adopt protumor and antitumor activity. Protumor neutrophils
      are functionally related to the recently described granulocytic myeloid-derived
      suppressor cells. We propose a model in which homeostatic chronic recruitment and
      activation of neutrophils result in mainly protumor activity. In contrast,
      therapeutic interventions in many cases elicit acute activation, enhance direct
      effector functions as well as indirect regulatory functions of neutrophils with
      potent antitumor activity. Conversion of protumor activity of neutrophils into
      antitumor activity by means of appropriate stimulation or modulation may offer
      new possibilities in biologic therapy of cancer.

      system in cancer cells.
PG  - 157-72
AB  - MicroRNAs have emerged as important post-transcriptional regulators of gene
      expression. Identification of cancer-regulated microRNAs or other classes of
      endogenous small RNAs have advanced our knowledge in cancer progression and
      metastasis. Among many tools, small RNA cloning is a powerful method to identify 
      new microRNAs (miRNAs) and to profile miRNA expression and function. Retroviral
      system is also the minimum requirement for the studying of miRNAs in a highly
      stable population of cancer cells or other primary cell types with high
      expression. This chapter describes a step-by-step protocol that is optimized to
      clone directly one of the miRNA miR-145, as an example, from genomic DNA into
      retroviral vector to yield ultimate overexpression for functional study in
      prostate cancer cells. The small RNAs cloned by this protocol will have an easy
      and simple way of cloning from genomic DNA to maintain the necessary motifs of
      native enhancer for enhancement of mature miRNA expression. Furthermore, the
      procedure eliminates miRNA extraction and cDNA synthesis before cloning and
      sequential cloning of more than one miRNA makes this protocol cost- and
      time-effective to eliminate many frequent cell culturing.

TI  - Transgene-like animal models using intronic microRNAs.
PG  - 279-94
AB  - Transgenic animal models are valuable tools for testing gene functions and drug
      mechanisms in vivo. They are also the best similitude for a human body for
      etiological and pathological research of diseases. All pharmaceutically developed
      drugs must be proven to be safe and effective in animals before approval by the
      Food and Drug Administration to be used in clinical trials. To this end, the
      transgenic animal models of diseases serve as the front line of drug evaluation. 
      However, there is currently no transgenic animal model for microRNA (miRNA)
      research. miRNAs, small single-stranded regulatory RNAs capable of silencing
      intracellular gene transcripts (mRNAs) that contain either complete or partial
      complementarity to the miRNA, are useful for the design of new therapies against 
      cancer polymorphism and viral mutation. Recently, varieties of natural miRNAs
      have been found to derived from hairpin-like RNA precursors in almost all
      eukaryotes, including yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), plant (Arabidopsis
      spp.), nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans), fly (Drosophila melanogaster), fish,
      mouse, and human, involving intracellular defense against viral infections and
      regulation of certain gene expressions during development. To facilitate the
      miRNA research in vivo, we have developed a state-of-the-art transgenic strategy 
      for silencing specific genes in zebrafish, chicken, and mouse, using intronic
      miRNAs. By insertion of a hairpin-like pre-miRNA structure into the intron region
      of a gene, we have found that mature miRNAs were successfully transcribed by RNA 
      polymerases type II (Pol II), coexpressed with the encoding gene transcript, and 
      excised out of the encoding gene transcript by natural RNA splicing and
      processing mechanisms. In conjunction with retroviral transfection systems, the
      designed hairpin-like pre-miRNA construct was further tested to insert into the
      intron regions of a cellular gene for tissue-specific expression regulated by the
      gene promoter. Because the retroviral vectors were randomly integrated into the
      genome of its host cell, the most effective transgenic animal can be selected and
      propagated to be a stable transgenic line for future research. Here, we have
      shown for the first time that transgene-like animal models were generated using
      the intronic miRNA-expressing system described previously, which has been proven 
      to be useful for both miRNA research and in vivo evaluation of miRNA-associated
      target gene functions.

PG  - 313-24
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) in human saliva have recently become an emerging field in
      saliva research for -diagnostics applications and its potential role in
      biological implications. miRNAs are short noncoding RNA molecules that play
      important roles in regulating a variety of cellular processes. Dysregulation of
      miRNAs are known to be associated with many diseases. miRNAs were found present
      in the saliva of OSCC patients and could serve as potential biomarkers for oral
      cancer detection. Understanding the biological function of miRNAs in association 
      with diseases is important towards utilizing miRNAs as diagnostic markers. There 
      are currently a variety of profiling methods available for detecting miRNA
      expression levels. In this chapter, we overview the Applied Biosystem Stem-loop
      RT based Taqman MicroRNA Assay for salivary miRNA profiling. Using this highly
      sensitive and specific assay, miRNAs in saliva are profiled with only a few
      nanograms of starting RNA. This method is also applicable for studying biomarkers
      in other body fluids or clinical samples that contain small amounts of RNA.

TI  - MiRNA targets of prostate cancer.
PG  - 357-69
AB  - Prostate cancer (PC) is the most prevalent strain of cancer in men, but it is
      often slow-acting or undetected. Common diagnostic tools for PC include prostate 
      biopsy and consequent analysis by the Gleason scoring of the tissue samples, as
      well as tests for the presence and levels of prostate-specific antigens. Common
      treatments for androgen-dependent PC include prostatectomy or irradiation, which 
      can be invasive and significantly lower the patient's quality of life.
      Alternative treatments exist, such as androgen ablation therapy, which, though
      effective, causes relapse into androgen-independent PC, which is far more
      invasive and likely to metastasize to other parts of the body. MicroRNAs (miRNA) 
      are short nucleotide sequences (between 19 and 25 nucleotides long) that bind to 
      various targeted messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences post-transcriptionally through
      complementary binding and control gene expression, often through silencing or
      leading to the degradation of targeted mRNA. Studies have shown that miRNAs are
      expressed abnormally in various cancers, suggesting that they play a pivotal role
      in cancer development and progression. Some miRNAs are oncogenes that incite
      cancerous growth, while others are involved in tumor suppression and cell cycle
      controls. MiRNA expression also differs in various types of cancers. Studies of
      PC-specific miRNAs show potential for their utilization in the prevention,
      diagnosis, and treatment of PC to more effectively target tumor growth and
      provide patients with better therapeutic options.

AB  - Owing to aggressiveness and chemoresistance, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
      (PDAC) is characterised by a poor prognosis. To address this disease-spe-cific
      dilemma we aimed to establish animal models, which can be used for identifying
      new specific tumor markers, as well as serving as tools for potential therapeutic
      approaches. From a panel of sixteen pancreatic cancer cell lines, two human
      (Suit2-007 and Suit2-013) and a rat (ASML) cell line were selected for their
      properties to grow in the liver of male RNU rats and mimic liver metastasis of
      PDAC. For better monitoring of metastatic tumor growth in vivo, all three
      pancreatic cancer cell lines were stably transfected with eGFP and luciferase
      marker genes. In addition, the mRNA expression profile of 13 human PDAC cell
      lines was analyzed by BeadChip array analysis. Only 33 genes and 5 signaling
      pathways were identified as significantly associated with the ability of the cell
      lines to grow initially and/or consistently in rat liver. Only a minority of
      these genes (osteopontin, matrix metalloproteinase-1 and insulin-like growth
      factor 1) has been intensively studied and shown to be closely related to cancer 
      progression. The function of the remaining 30 genes ranges from moderate to
      poorly investigated, and their function in cancer progression is still unclear.
      The ensuing three pancreatic cancer liver metastasis models vary in their
      aggressiveness and macroscopic growth. They will be used for preclinical
      evaluation of new therapeutic approaches aiming at the genes identified.

AB  - The present study investigated the antitumor action of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor
      blockers on human bladder, prostate and renal cancer cells. For bladder cancer
      cell lines used here such as 253J, 5637, KK-47, T24 and UM-UC-3 cells, prazosin, 
      a selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor blocker, reduced cell viability at
      concentrations more than 30 micromol/l. Likewise, naftopidil, a blocker of
      alpha(1A)- and alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors, reduced cell viability for all the
      bladder cancer cells used here in a concentration (10-100 micromol/l)-dependent
      manner, with a much greater advantage than prazosin. Naftopidil also reduced cell
      viability for human prostate cancer cell lines such as DU145, LNCap and PC-3
      cells and ACHN human renal cancer cells, with a much higher potential than
      prazosin. Thus, the results of the present study suggest that naftopidil could be
      a beneficial antitumor drug for the treatment of urological cancers.

PG  - 227-47
LID - 10.1007/s00204-012-0931-2 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant tumor that
      accounts for ~80 % of all liver cancer cases worldwide. It is a multifactorial
      disease caused by a variety of risk factors and often develops in the background 
      of underlying cirrhosis. A number of cellular phenomena, such as tumor
      microenvironment, inflammation, oxidative stress, and hypoxia act in concert with
      various molecular events to facilitate tumor initiation, progression, and
      metastasis. The emergence of microRNAs and molecular-targeted therapies adds a
      new dimension in our efforts to combat this deadly disease. Intense research in
      this multitude of areas has led to significant progress in our understanding of
      cellular processes and molecular mechanisms that occur during multistage events
      that lead to hepatocarcinogenesis. In this review, we discuss the current
      knowledge of HCC, focusing mainly on advances that have occurred during the past 
      5 years and on the development of novel therapeutics for liver cancer.

TI  - Impact of biomarkers on clinical trial risk in breast cancer.
PG  - 179-85
LID - 10.1007/s10549-012-2247-6 [doi]
AB  - We determined the success rate of new drug approval by the US FDA in two breast
      cancer indications, one of which used a biomarker. This allowed us to assess if
      biomarkers improved clinical trial risk in breast cancer. We performed a
      retrospective screening of industry-sponsored drug development programs
      registered on clinicaltrials.gov from 1998 to 2012 for HER2-positive patients
      compared to patients that had either failed or had been exposed to anthracycline 
      or taxane, whose first phase I in this indication occurred no earlier than 1998. 
      Compounds not registered on clinicaltrials.gov and studied exclusively outside
      the US were excluded. Twenty-nine drugs for HER2-positive patients and 28 drugs
      for anthracycline/taxane-exposed patients met our screening criteria. The overall
      success rate of new drug development in anthracycline/taxane patients was only 15
      %, while in HER2-positive patients it was 23 %. However, HER2-targeted therapies 
      underperformed compared to broad acting agents. The cost for clinical trial
      testing alone, when adjusted for the risk of failure, for HER2-positive breast
      cancer patients was $199 million, significantly lower than the cost of $274
      million for anthracycline/taxane-experienced patients. The use of a validated
      biomarker, such as HER2, reduced clinical trial risk by as much as 50 % resulting
      in cost savings of 27 % in advanced and metastatic breast cancer. However, these 
      data have to be evaluated in a context in which studies combining a novel drug
      with a novel biomarker not yet recognized by the FDA may actually increase
      clinical trial risk.

      monoclonal antibody CE-355621.
PG  - 710-23
LID - 10.4161/mabs.22160 [doi]
AB  - The c-Met proto-oncogene is a multifunctional receptor tyrosine kinase that is
      stimulated by its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), to induce cell growth, 
      motility and morphogenesis. Dysregulation of c-Met function, through mutational
      activation or overexpression, has been observed in many types of cancer and is
      thought to contribute to tumor growth and metastasis by affecting mitogenesis,
      invasion, and angiogenesis. We identified human monoclonal antibodies that bind
      to the extracellular domain of c-Met and inhibit tumor growth by interfering with
      ligand-dependent c-Met activation. We identified antibodies representing four
      independent epitope classes that inhibited both ligand binding and
      ligand-dependent activation of c-Met in A549 cells. In cells, the antibodies
      antagonized c-Met function by blocking receptor activation and by subsequently
      inducing downregulation of the receptor, translating to phenotypic effects in
      soft agar growth and tubular morphogenesis assays. Further characterization of
      the antibodies in vivo revealed significant inhibition of c-Met activity (>/= 80%
      lasting for 72-96 h) in excised tumors corresponded to tumor growth inhibition in
      multiple xenograft tumor models. Several of the antibodies identified inhibited
      the growth of tumors engineered to overexpress human HGF and human c-Met (S114
      NIH 3T3) when grown subcutaneously in athymic mice. Furthermore, lead candidate
      antibody CE-355621 inhibited the growth of U87MG human glioblastoma and GTL-16
      gastric xenografts by up to 98%. The findings support published pre-clinical and

TI  - The expression of URGCP gene in prostate cancer cell lines: correlation with
      rapamycin.
PG  - 10173-7
LID - 10.1007/s11033-012-1891-6 [doi]
AB  - Molecular targets in prostate cancer are continually being explored, for which
      there are currently few therapeutic options. Rapamycin (RPM) is an antifungal
      macrolide antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces hygroscopicus which can inhibit
      the G1 to S transition. URGCP (upregulator of cell proliferation) is a novel gene
      located on chromosome 7p13. We aimed to investigate the role of URGCP gene
      expression changes in PC3, DU145, and LNCAP cell lines with/out RPM. Average cell
      viability and cytotoxic effect of rapamycin were investigated at 24 h intervals
      for three days by using Trypan blue dye exclusion test and XTT assay. Cytotoxic
      effects of rapamycin in DU145, PC3 and LNCAP cells were detected in time and dose
      dependent manner with the IC(50) doses within the range of 1-100 nM. As the
      results were evaluated, IC(50) doses in the DU145, PC3, and LNCaP cells were
      detected as 10, 25, and 50 nM, respectively. The mean relative ratios of URGCP
      gene expression in DU145, LNCAP and PC3 cells were found as -1.48, 6.59 and
      -13.00, respectively, when compared to rapamycin-free cells. The False Discovery 
      Rate adjusted p value in DU145, LNCAP and PC3 were 1.25 x 10(-5), 2.20 x 10(-8)
      and 6.20 x 10(-9), respectively. When the URGCP gene expression level is compared
      between the dose and control group, we found that URGCP gene expression was
      significantly decreased in dose groups of DU145 and PC3 cells.

TI  - Histone deacetylase inhibitor BML-210 induces growth inhibition and apoptosis and
      regulates HDAC and DAPC complex expression levels in cervical cancer cells.
PG  - 10179-86
LID - 10.1007/s11033-012-1892-5 [doi]
AB  - Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) represent a new class of targeted
      anti-cancer agents and different other diseases, like muscular disorders. A
      number of studies have shown that extracellular signal-activated kinases can
      target chromatin-modifying complexes directly and regulate their function. The
      molecular connection between the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) and
      chromatin has been described, by showing that NO signaling regulates histone
      deacetylase (HDAC) activity and influences gene expression in different cell
      types. In present study, we investigated HDACs changes in HeLa cells undergoing
      growth inhibition and apoptosis, caused by HDACI BML-210 and retinoic acid
      (ATRA). Cell cycle analysis indicated that HeLa cell treatment with 20 and 30 muM
      concentration of BML-210 increased the proportion of cells in G0/G1 phase, and
      caused accumulation in subG1, indicating that the cells are undergoing apoptosis.
      We determined down-regulation of HDAC 1-5 and 7 after treatment with BML-210.
      Also, we demonstrated expression of different isoforms of alpha-dystrobrevin
      (alpha-DB) and other components of DAPC such as syntrophin, dystrophin,
      beta-dystrobrevin (beta-DB) and NOS in HeLa cells after treatments. We determined
      changes in protein expression level of dystrophin, NOS1, alpha- and beta-DB and
      in subcellular localization of alpha-DB after treatments with BML-210 and ATRA.
      In conclusion, these results suggest that HDACI BML-210 can inhibit cell growth
      and induce apoptosis in cervical cancer cells, what correlates with
      down-regulation of HDAC class I and II and changes in the DAPC expression levels.
      This can be important for identifying target proteins in DAPC signaling to HDACs,
      as a target of pharmacological intervention for treatment of muscular dystrophies
      and other diseases.

AB  - Copy number variation (CNV) is crucial for gene regulation in humans. A number of
      studies have revealed that CNV contributes to the initiation and progression of
      cancer. In this study, we analysed four breast cancer cell lines and six fresh
      frozen tissues from patients to evaluate the CNV present in the genome using
      microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Six genes located at
      16q22.1 were analysed by real-time PCR. The real-time PCR analysis revealed that 
      the loss of CDH1/E2F4 may be associated with worse clinical and pathological
      findings. Interestingly, covariation of CDH1, CDH3, CTCF and E2F4 was found to be
      associated with triple negative breast cancer and HER-2 receptor status. In
      conclusion, our study supports the idea that CNV at 16q22.1 in breast cancer is a
      frequent event; furthermore, it reveals the covariation of CDH1, CDH3, CTCF and
      E2F4. The role of the covariation is more complex than a simple additive effect
      of these four separate genes, which may provide a novel target for breast cancer.

      adolescent and young adult cancer.
PG  - 5964-72
LID - 10.1002/cncr.27537 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care outcomes for long-term survivors of adolescent and young 
      adult (AYA) cancer were compared with young adults without a cancer history,
      using the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data. METHODS: Eligible
      participants were 20 to 39 years of age. There were N = 979 who self-reported a
      cancer diagnosis between the ages of 15 to 34 years and were at least 5 years
      from diagnosis (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer). The remaining 67,216
      participants with no cancer history were used as controls. Using multivariable
      regressions, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were generated to
      examine the relationship of survivor status on indicators of poor health care
      (uninsured, no personal health care provider, no routine care, and avoiding
      seeing a doctor due to cost). Adjusted proportions were calculated by demographic
      groups. Results are weighted by Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey
      design. RESULTS: Although the proportion uninsured did not differ (21% of
      survivors vs 23% of controls), AYA survivors reported forgoing care due to cost
      at higher levels than controls (relative risk = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.44-1.94). Cost
      barriers were particularly high for survivors aged 20 to 29 years (44% vs 16% of 
      controls; P < .001) and female survivors (35% vs 18% of controls; P < .001).
      Survivors reporting poorer health had more cost barriers. Moreover, uninsured
      survivors tended to report lower use of health care than did controls.
      CONCLUSIONS: AYA cancer survivors may forgo health care due to cost barriers,
      potentially inhibiting the early detection of late effects. Expanding health
      insurance coverage for young cancer survivors may be insufficient without
      adequate strategies to reduce their medical cost burdens.

TI  - Downregulation of protein kinase CK2 induces autophagic cell death through
      modulation of the mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways in human glioblastoma cells.
PG  - 1967-76
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2012.1635 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common primary brain tumor and one of the
      most aggressive types of cancer in adults. Survival signaling and apoptosis
      resistance are hallmarks of malignant glioma cells. However, recent studies have 
      shown that other types of cell death such as autophagy can be induced in
      malignant glioma cells. This suggests that stimulation of this process may be
      explored in new therapeutic strategies against glioblastoma multiforme. Protein
      kinase CK2 is a highly conserved and constitutively active enzyme that promotes
      numerous cellular processes such as survival, proliferation and differentiation. 
      CK2 has been found elevated in several malignancies including brain tumors, and
      to confer resistance against chemotherapeutic agents and apoptotic stimuli.
      Recently, we have shown that the siRNA-mediated downregulation of CK2 leads to
      cell death in DNA-PK-proficient human glioblastoma cells. We show, here, that
      lack of CK2 results in significant induction of autophagic cell death in two
      human glioblastoma cell lines, M059K and T98G, as indicated by the positive
      staining of cells with the acidotropic dye acridine orange, and the specific
      recruitment of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) to
      autophagosome membranes. Induction of autophagy is accompanied by CK2-dependent
      decreased phosphorylation of p70 ribosomal S6 and AKT kinases and significantly
      reduced expression levels of Raptor. In contrast, phosphorylation and activity
      levels of ERK1/2 are enhanced suggesting an inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 and
      activation of the ERK1/2 pathways. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated silencing of CK2
      results in increased mitochondrial superoxide production in both glioblastoma
      cell lines. However, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species release correlates
      with induction of autophagy only in T98G cells. Taken together, our findings
      identify CK2 as a novel component of the autophagic machinery and underline the
      potential of its downregulation to kill glioblastoma cells by overcoming the
      resistance to multiple anticancer agents.

LID - 10.3892/or.2012.2051 [doi]
AB  - When purified from a tumor, certain heat shock protein 70 (HSP70)-peptide
      complexes (PCs) can function as effective vaccines against the tumor from which
      the complexes were isolated. The immunogenic mechanisms of HSP70 preparations
      imply that tumor-derived HSP70-PCs exhibit antigens associated with
      antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), inducing antigen-specific
      cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. However, some important membrane-resident
      tumor-associated peptides, such as the HER-2/neu (c-erbB2) oncogenic protein,
      cannot be purified from HSP70 by traditional methods. In the present study, a new
      approach for the purification of HSP70-PCs from HER-2-overexpressing breast
      cancer cells was established. The detergent
      3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) was used to
      obtain more effectual tumor peptides. The new purified product was named
      HSP70-HER-2-PC, and its immunological activities were determined. Traditionally
      purified HSP70-PCs (without CHAPS) and recombinant human HSP70-HER-2 protein
      complexes (recombined in vitro) were used as controls. These three
      HSP70-associated tumor antigenic complex pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) were used
      to stimulate an antitumor response. The mature DCs pulsed with HSP70-HER-2-PCs
      stimulated autologous T cells to secrete higher levels of type I cytokine
      compared to the two control groups. Moreover, DCs pulsed with HSP70-HER-2-PCs
      induced the most specific CD8+ T cells that specifically killed the same tumor
      cells. These findings provide a basis for new approaches in enhancing HSP70-based
      immunotherapy for HER-2-associated or other membrane antigenic peptide-related
      cancers.

TI  - Up-regulation of Che-1 relates to neuronal apoptosis after traumatic brain injury
      in adult rats.
PG  - 85-97
LID - 10.1007/s10571-012-9874-7 [doi]
AB  - Che-1, a recently identified apoptosis related protein, affects the fate of
      various cell types when under stress. One attractive biological function of Che-1
      is promoting the transcription of p53 after DNA damage; besides, it can also
      regulate cell cycle via interacting with retinoblastoma protein. Although
      previous evidence has showed its anti-apoptotic role in cancer cells, some
      studies point out that Che-1 might play an opposite role in central nervous
      system (CNS). However, the function of Che-1 in CNS is still with limited
      acquaintance. To investigate whether Che-1 is involved in CNS lesion, we
      performed a traumatic brain injury model in adult rats. Up-regulation of Che-1
      was observed in the peritrauma brain cortex by performing western blotting and
      immunohistochemistry. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxy-UTP nick-end
      labeling and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining suggested that Che-1 was
      involved in neuronal apoptosis after brain injury. We also investigated
      co-localization of Che-1 and active-caspase-3 in the ipsilateral brain cortex. In
      addition, the expression patterns of p53, Bax and PCNA were parallel with that of
      Che-1. Besides this, neurotrophin receptor-interacting MAGE homolog was found to 
      be associated with Che-1 after brain trauma. Based on our data, we suggested that
      Che-1 might play an important role in neuronal apoptosis following TBI; and might
      provide a basis for the further study on its role in regulating the expression of
      p53 and cell cycle re-entry in traumatic brain injury.

PG  - 377-82
LID - 10.1007/s10120-012-0196-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of
      postoperative blood transfusion and anemia with postoperative outcomes in gastric
      cancer surgery. METHODS: We enrolled 588 patients who had undergone curative
      resection for gastric cancer. Input variables for risk assessment consisted of 3 
      categories: patient demographics, surgical and pathological factors, and
      anemia-related factors. Postoperative outcomes included 30-day morbidity and
      mortality. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk
      factors influencing postoperative complications. RESULTS: The rate of total
      complications was 19.0%. Comorbidity, lowest hemoglobin (Hb) level from the
      operative day up to postoperative day 7 (LOW-Hb), the percentage of drop in Hb
      level on postoperative day 2 (POD2-Hb change), and postoperative transfusion were
      independent risk factors in the multivariate analysis, with LOW-Hb and
      postoperative transfusion found to be the most significant factors. When LOW-Hb
      was >/=9.0 g/dL, postoperative complications were higher in the transfused group 
      than in the non-transfused group (60.0 vs. 14.2%, respectively, p = 0.024), but
      when LOW-Hb was <9.0 g/dL, postoperative complications were not different between
      the 2 groups (44.6 vs. 37.5%, p = 0.525). CONCLUSION: The lowest postoperative Hb
      level and postoperative transfusion were the most significant risk factors for
      postoperative complications in gastric cancer surgery.

TI  - miR-183 as a molecular and protective biomarker for cancer in schizophrenic
      subjects.
PG  - 2200-4
LID - 10.3892/or.2012.2052 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that schizophrenia is associ-ated with a reduced 
      risk of cancer. Genes that are involved in cell cycle regulation seem to have
      additional functions in post-mitotic neurons involved in neuronal migration and
      synaptic plasticity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a dominant role in the regulation of
      gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS). Due to their involvement in 
      a large number of CNS pathways, miRNAs pose as appealing molecules for further
      investigation, with potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value. In
      the present study, we investigated the potential association between cancer and
      schizophrenia in 2 patient sample groups. We analyzed a large number of miRNAs in
      a control group of 6 schizophrenic patients and a study group of 8 schizophrenic 
      patients with a solid tumor. A comparison between the control and study groups
      showed that only miR-183 was differentially expressed. Specifically, a
      significant downregulation of miR-183 in the samples of the study group was
      observed. Although a larger sample size is required to validate this result for
      the general patient population, our findings provide a first indication that
      miR-183 may play a role in regulating the expression of other genes with
      onco-suppressor activity. Our results are in agreement with the theory that
      patients with schizophrenia may have a tumor suppressor gene or enhanced neuronal
      apoptotic activities. Further studies are required in order to shed light on the 
      role of miRNAs and particularly, on the suppressive role of miR-183 in the
      neurobiological pathways involved in schizophrenia.

TI  - Chemoprevention of pancreatic cancer using solid-lipid nanoparticulate delivery
      of a novel aspirin, curcumin and sulforaphane drug combination regimen.
PG  - 2260-8
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2012.1636 [doi]
AB  - Pancreatic cancer is the fourth largest cause of cancer deaths in the Unites
      States and the prognosis is grim with <5% survival chances upon diagnosis. The
      objective of this study was to assess the combined chemopreventive effect of
      solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) encapsulated drugs aspirin (ASP), curcumin (CUR)
      and free sulforaphane (SFN) for the chemoprevention of pancreatic cancer.
      Experiments were carried out (1) to evaluate the feasibility of encapsulation of 
      these chemopreventive agents within solid lipid systems and (2) to measure the
      synergistic effects of a combination of ASP with CUR in SLNs mixed with free SFN 
      against cell proliferation and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells, MIA PaCa-2
      and Panc-1. The SLNs were prepared using a modified solvent evaporation technique
      and were characterized for particle sizing, encapsulation efficiency and drug
      release. ASP and CUR SLNs were formulated within the particle size range of
      150250 nm and were found to have an encapsulation efficiency of 85 and 69%,
      respectively. Sustained release of drugs over a 96 h period from SLNs was
      observed. The SLNs were stable over a 3-month storage period at room temperature.
      Cell viability studies demonstrated that combinations of low doses of ASP SLN (25
      microM), CUR SLN (2.5 microM) and free SFN (5 microM) significantly reduced cell 
      viability by 43.6 and 48.49% in MIAPaca-2 and Panc-1 cell lines, respectively.
      Furthermore, increased apoptosis of 61.3 and 60.37% was found in MIA Paca-2 and
      Panc-1 cell lines, respectively, in comparison to the individual doses
      administered. Synergistic effects were demonstrated using MTS and apoptosis
      assays. Thus, this study successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a
      solid lipid nanoparticulate system for the first time to deliver this novel
      combination chemoprevention regimen, providing valuable evidence for the
      usability of nanotechnology-based drug regimens towards pancreatic cancer
      chemoprevention.

      impact on overall survival. We investigated whether HNC and its comorbidity also 
      influence routine laboratory values and whether these values have influence on
      overall survival. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 261 patients with primary
      squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx diagnosed between 
      2001 and 2006 with a complete set of pretherapeutic laboratory values was
      identified. The influence of standard oncological parameters, comorbidity, and
      each laboratory value on overall survival (OS) was investigated in univariate and
      multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Two-thirds of patients were active smokers and
      about one half reported high alcohol consumption. 40 % of patients had severe
      comorbidity according to Charlson comorbidity index. The most frequent laboratory
      pathologies were elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) values (66 %), impaired liver 
      enzymes (30-50 %), decreased urea levels (33 %), leukocytosis (20 %), and anemia 
      (10 %). In multivariate analysis for OS, a comorbidity index >/=5 (Hazard ratio
      [HR], 2.008; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.117-3.610; p = 0.020), high CRP
      level (HR, 2.469; CI, 1.414-4.310; p = 0.001), and abnormal low red-cell count
      (HR, 2.525; CI, 1.250-5.102; p = 0.010) were independent prognostic variables.
      CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity reflected by pathologic laboratory values is a major
      issue in HNC patients. Several pretherapeutic laboratory values have prognostic
      relevance for overall survival in HNC patients.

AB  - Estimating the prognostic effect of a time-dependent covariate could be tricky
      using a classical Cox model, despite adjustment on other known prognostic
      factors. This study evaluated and compared the performance of a Cox model
      including the covariate occurring over time as a time-dependent covariate and the
      so-called 'illness-death' multistate model, which is usually used to describe
      event-history data. We assess breast cancer prognosis related to a subsequent
      pregnancy occurring over time after cancer treatment in young women. We generated
      simulations. We considered constant and time-varying prognostic hazard ratios (
      HR(t)) between patients undergoing the intermediate event and those who did not. 
      We used both the classical Cox model and the multistate model to estimate the
      prognostic effect of the intermediate event HR(t). We also used the latter to
      estimate the covariate effect on each transition (exp(beta(ij) )), thus helping
      to interpret HR(t) by taking into account the disease history. We applied these
      approaches to a female cohort treated and followed up in eight French Hospitals
      since 1990.

TI  - S100P is a metastasis-associated gene that facilitates transendothelial migration
      of pancreatic cancer cells.
PG  - 251-64
LID - 10.1007/s10585-012-9532-y [doi]
AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the 5th most common cause of cancer
      death in the UK and the 4th in the US. The vast majority of deaths following
      pancreatic cancer are due to metastatic spread, hence understanding the
      metastatic process is vital for identification of critically needed novel
      therapeutic targets. An enriched set of 33 genes differentially expressed in
      common between primary PDAC and liver metastases, when compared to normal
      tissues, was obtained through global gene expression profiling. This
      metastasis-associated gene set comprises transcripts from both cancer (S100P,
      S100A6, AGR2, etc.) and adjacent stroma (collagens type I, III, and V, etc.),
      thus reinforcing the concept of a continuous crosstalk between the two
      compartments in both primary tumours and their metastases. The expression of
      S100P, SFN, VCAN and collagens was further validated in additional primary PDACs 
      and matched liver metastatic lesions, while the functional significance of one of
      the most highly expressed genes, S100P, was studied in more detail. We show that 
      this protein increases the transendothelial migration of PDAC cancer cells in
      vitro, which was also confirmed in vivo experiments using a zebrafish embryo
      model. Thus S100P facilitates cancer cell intravasation/extravasation, critical
      steps in the hematogenous dissemination of pancreatic cancer cells.

      expression profiling of gastric cancer.
PG  - 2166-74
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2012.1637 [doi]
AB  - We previously analyzed the microRNA (miRNA) expression pattern in gastric cancer 
      with and without recurrence and obtained 17 differentially expressed miRNAs with 
      potential to predict recurrence risk for GC patients. In the present study, we
      aimed to investigate recurrence-related genes which may be regulated by the
      differentially expressed miRNAs identified in our prior research. Three different
      miRNA target gene databases (miRanda, TargetScan and PicTar) were used for
      searching the potential genes regulated by miRNAs. A combination was performed
      between miRNA target genes and recurrence-related gene expression profiling.
      Three bioinformatics algorithms (PAM, SVM and RF) were used to feature
      recurrence-related gene selection. In addition, we validated the expression
      levels of the genes in GC patients using real-time PCR. A total of 3,263 genes
      were identified as potential targets of 17 miRNAs. We identified 2,736
      differential expressed genes using the SAM method based on 22K oligo microarray
      data which included 7 recurrence and 4 without recurrence GC samples. Combining
      the target genes regulated by miRNAs and the differentially expressed genes
      between recurrence and non-recurrence groups, we identified 228 differential
      genes for further study. Finally, we identified HNRPA0 and PRDM4 as risk
      biomarkers of GC patients, which were regulated by hsa-miR194 and hsa-miR-373,
      respectively. Our data indicated that HNRPA0 and PRDM4 may be involved in the
      recurrence process of GC and have potential to act as new prognostic biomarkers
      in predicting recurrence risk for gastric cancer patients.

TI  - Dual ErbB1 and ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition exerts synergistic
      effect with conventional chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer.
PG  - 2211-6
LID - 10.3892/or.2012.2053 [doi]
AB  - Patient survival in pancreatic cancer remains poor with gemcitabine (GEM)-based
      regimens. The target specific molecular agent lapatinib, a dual ErbB1 and ErbB2
      receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown significant activity against ErbB1 
      and ErbB2-expressing tumors. Since pancreatic tumors frequently overexpress these
      proteins, we investigated its effects, both alone and in conjunction with 5-FU or
      GEM. The pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 and AsPC were treated with varying
      doses of lapatinib in vitro. The effects on ErbB1/ErbB2 protein phosphorylation
      and on the cell survival protein survivin were determined by western blotting.
      Cytotoxicity was determined by MTT assay and apoptosis was measured using the
      caspase-3 colorimetric assay. Similar dose-response lapatinib experiments were
      conducted with varying concentrations of 5-FU or GEM and isobolograms were
      constructed to evaluate therapeutic synergy. Lapatinib inhibited protein
      phosphorylation in the range of 4-16 microM, a clinically achievable
      concentration. The lapatinib-treated cells showed a dose-dependent inhibition of 
      cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis at the same concentrations that
      blocked ErbB1/ErbB2 phosphorylation. The addition of 5-FU or GEM to these cells
      resulted in synergistic effects. The lapatinib-treated cells also demonstrated
      downregulation of survivin. Simultaneous dual ErbB1 and ErbB2 receptor tyrosine
      kinase inhibition with lapatinib results in significant reduction of pancreatic
      cancer cell growth and proliferation. These effects occur at clinically
      achievable concentrations and are synergistic with the effects of 5-FU or GEM.
      These findings support the potential role of lapatinib in the treatment of
      pancreatic cancer.

TI  - Lymphaticovenular bypass surgery for lymphedema management in breast cancer
      patients.
PG  - 343-7
LID - 10.1055/s-0032-1323762 [doi]
AB  - Historically, the reported incidence of upper extremity lymphedema in breast
      cancer survivors who have undergone axillary lymph node dissection has ranged
      from 9% to 41%. In the past 2 decades, sentinel lymph node biopsy has become
      popular as a way to minimize the morbidity associated with axillary dissection
      without compromising the cure rate for breast cancer patients. However, even with
      sentinel node biopsy, the postoperative incidence of upper limb lymphedema in
      breast cancer patients remains at 4-10%. Lymphedema occasionally emerges
      immediately after surgery but most often appears after a latent period. Obesity, 
      postoperative seroma, and radiation therapy have been reported as major risk
      factors for upper extremity lymphedema, but the etiology of lymphedema is still
      not fully understood. Common symptoms of upper limb lymphedema are increased
      volume and weight of the affected limb and increased skin tension. The increased 
      volume of the affected limb not only causes physical impairments in wearing
      clothes and in dexterity but also affects patients' emotional and mental status. 
      Surgical management of lymphedema can be broadly categorized into physiologic
      methods and reductive techniques. Physiologic methods such as flap interposition,
      lymph node transfers, and lymphatic bypass procedures aim to decrease lymphedema 
      by restoring lymphatic drainage. In contrast, reductive techniques such as direct
      excision or liposuction aim to remove fibrofatty tissue generated as a
      consequence of sustained lymphatic fluid stasis. Currently, microsurgical
      variations of lymphatic bypass, in which excess lymph trapped within the
      lymphedematous limb is redirected into other lymphatic basins or into the venous 
      circulation, have gained popularity.

TI  - Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in cancer patients: predictors of 30-day
      complications, 30-day mortality, and overall mortality.
PG  - 768-76

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer patients benefit from percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
      (PEG) in many ways including nutritional support and venting in cases of
      malignant obstruction. Lack of high-quality studies with adequate follow-up has
      led to limited information regarding risk stratification and predictors of
      morbidity and mortality. AIMS: Elucidate predictors of complications and
      mortality with long-term follow-up in cancer patients undergoing PEG. METHOD:
      Retrospective review of all patients undergoing PEG placement at MD Anderson
      Cancer Center from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2006. Statistical analysis
      included descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, and Cox
      proportional hazards regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 218 subjects
      underwent PEG. Those with American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) scores of 4,
      4E, or 5E were at significant risk of a major complication in the first 30 days. 
      Multivariate analysis revealed ASA scores >/=4, elevated WBC count, and advanced 
      tumor stage to be independent predictors of mortality in the first 30 days and
      INR >1.5 and diversion/venting as an indication for PEG placement to be
      independent predictors of overall mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with high
      baseline illness severity are more likely to have complications and are at
      increased risk of mortality after PEG. Our study results suggest that particular 
      attention be directed to ASA score, INR, WBC counts, transfusion requirements,
      presence of advanced malignancies, and the indication for PEG placement when
      determining risk of complications or death. Patients undergoing venting PEG are
      expected to have short post-PEG survival but improvement in quality of life
      likely justifies the risks associated with PEG placement.

TI  - miRNA expression profile of colon cancer stem cells compared to non-stem cells
      using the SW1116 cell line.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the major causes of cancer-related mortality
      worldwide. Recent studies revealed that there is a relationship between CRC
      occurrence and microRNA (miRNA) function. Stem cells are a type of cells that
      have the ability to self-renew and to proliferate extensively while maintaining
      the undifferentiated state. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are closely linked to tumor 
      recurrence and metastasis. To this end, we evaluated the miRNA expression
      differences between colon CSCs and non-stem cells using the SW1116 cell line, to 
      determine the relationship between tumor stem cells and tumor biological
      behavior. We isolated populations of colon CSCs with the CD133+/CD44+ and
      CD133-/CD44- surface phenotype from a human SW1116 colon adenocarcinoma cell line
      using flow cytometry. The expression of miRNA and mRNA of both sets of cells was 
      examined with miRNA and mRNA arrays. Bioinformatic methods were used to analyze
      microarray results. We completed gene ontology analysis, pathway analysis, miRNA 
      target gene prediction with databases. We identified a colon stem cell miRNA
      expression profile comprising 31 upregulated and 31 downregulated miRNAs, such as
      miR29a, miR29b, miR449b and miR4524. Some of these differentially expressed
      miRNAs may be involved in the regulation of stem cell differentiation. Gene
      ontology and pathway analyses showed that the differences are closely related to 
      the function of the cell cycle, cell differentiation, signaling pathway,
      cytoskeletal proteins and cell-matrix adhesion in colon cancer stem cells. We
      found that miRNAs play an important role in regulating the expression of colon
      CSC characteristics. By regulating the expression of CSC signaling pathways,
      cytoskeleton and membrane proteins, miRNAs give tumor stem cells the
      macrobiological behavior of recurrence and metastasis. This study provides a new 
      perspective on CRC metastasis and recurrence.

TI  - The protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type J is regulated by the pVHL-HIF
      axis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
PG  - 525-34
LID - 10.1002/path.4107 [doi]
AB  - Mass spectrometry analysis of renal cancer cell lines recently suggested that the
      protein-tyrosine phosphatase receptor type J (PTPRJ), an important regulator of
      tyrosine kinase receptors, is tightly linked to the von Hippel-Lindau protein
      (pVHL). Therefore, we aimed to characterize the biological relevance of PTPRJ for
      clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In pVHL-negative ccRCC cell lines, both 
      RNA and protein expression levels of PTPRJ were lower than those in the
      corresponding pVHL reconstituted cells. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blot
      analysis of ccRCC with known VHL mutation status and normal matched tissues as
      well as RNA in situ hybridization on a tissue microarray (TMA) confirmed a
      decrease of PTPRJ expression in more than 80% of ccRCCs, but in only 12% of
      papillary RCCs. ccRCC patients with no or reduced PTPRJ mRNA expression had a
      less favourable outcome than those with a normal expression status (p = 0.05).
      Sequence analysis of 32 PTPRJ mRNA-negative ccRCC samples showed five known
      polymorphisms but no mutations, implying other mechanisms leading to PTPRJ's
      down-regulation. Selective silencing of HIF-alpha by siRNA and reporter gene
      assays demonstrated that pVHL inactivation reduces PTPRJ expression through a
      HIF-dependent mechanism, which is mainly driven by HIF-2alpha stabilization. Our 
      results suggest PTPRJ as a member of a pVHL-controlled pathway whose suppression 
      by HIF is critical for ccRCC development.

AB  - The recent development of a bi-modality magnetic resonance imaging/electron
      paramagnetic resonance imaging (MRI/EPRI) platform has enabled longitudinal
      monitoring of both tumor oxygenation and redox status in murine cancer models.
      The current study used this imaging platform to test the hypothesis that a more
      reducing tumor microenvironment accompanies the development of tumor hypoxia. To 
      test this, the redox status of the tumor was measured using Tempol as a
      redoxsensitive MRI contrast agent, and tumor hypoxia was measured with Oxo63,
      which is an oxygen-sensitive EPRI spin probe. Images were acquired every 1-2 days
      in mice bearing SCCVII tumors. The median pO(2) decreased from 14 mmHg at 7 days 
      after tumor implantation to 7 mmHg at 15 days after implantation. Additionally,
      the hypoxic fraction, defined as the percentage of the tumor that exhibited a
      pO(2)<10 mmHg, increased with tumor size (from 10% at 500 mm(3) to 60% at 3,500
      mm(3)). The rate of Tempol reduction increased as a function of tumor volume (0.4
      min(-1) at 500 mm(3) to 1.7 min(-1) at 3,500 mm(3)), suggesting that the tumor
      microenvironment became more reduced as the tumor grew. The results show that
      rapid Tempol reduction correlates with decreased tumor oxygenation, and that the 
      Tempol decay rate constant may be a surrogate marker for tumor hypoxia.

TI  - Contribution of bi-allelic germline MUTYH mutations to early-onset and familial
      colorectal cancer and to low number of adenomatous polyps: case-series and
      literature review.
PG  - 43-50
LID - 10.1007/s10689-012-9570-2 [doi]
AB  - In the absence of a polyposis phenotype, colorectal cancer (CRC) patients
      referred for genetic testing because of early-onset disease and/or a positive
      family history, typically undergo testing for molecular signs of Lynch syndrome
      in their tumors. In the absence of these signs, DNA testing for germline
      mutations associated with other known tumor syndromes is usually not performed.
      However, a few studies in large series of CRC patients suggest that in a small
      percentage of CRC cases, bi-allelic MUTYH germline mutations can be found in the 
      absence of the MUTYH-associated polyposis phenotype. This has not been studied in
      the Dutch population. Therefore, we analyzed the MUTYH gene for mutations in 89
      patients with microsatellite-low or stable CRC cancer diagnosed before the age of
      40 years or otherwise meeting the Bethesda criteria, all of them without a
      polyposis phenotype. In addition, we studied a series of 693 non-CRC patients
      with 1-13 adenomatous colorectal polyps for the MUTYH hotspot mutations Y179C,
      G396D and P405L. No bi-allelic MUTYH mutations were observed. Our data suggest
      that the contribution of bi-allelic MUTYH mutations to the development of CRC in 
      Dutch non-polyposis patients that meet clinical genetic referral criteria, and to
      the development of low number of colorectal adenomas in non-CRC patients, is
      likely to be low.

AB  - Links between cancer and stem cells have been proposed for many years. As the
      cancer stem cell (CSC) theory became widely studied, new methods were developed
      to culture and expand cancer cells with conserved determinants of "stemness".
      These cells show increased ability to grow in suspension as spheres in serum-free
      medium supplemented with growth factors and chemicals. The physiological
      relevance of this phenomenon in established cancer cell lines remains unclear.
      Cell lines have traditionally been used to explore tumor biology and serve as
      preclinical models for the screening of potential therapeutic agents. Here, we
      grew cell-forming spheres (CFS) from 25 established colorectal cancer cell lines.
      The molecular and cellular characteristics of CFS were compared to the bulk of
      tumor cells. CFS could be isolated from 72 % of the cell lines. Both CFS and
      their parental CRC cell lines were highly tumorigenic. Compared to their parental
      cells, they showed similar expression of putative CSC markers. The ability of CRC
      cells to grow as CFS was greatly enhanced by prior treatment with 5-fluorouracil.
      At the molecular level, CFS and parental CRC cells showed identical gene
      mutations and very similar genomic profiles, although microarray analysis
      revealed changes in CFS gene expression that were independent of DNA copy-number.
      We identified a CFS gene expression signature common to CFS from all CRC cell
      lines, which was predictive of disease relapse in CRC patients. In conclusion,
      CFS models derived from CRC cell lines possess interesting phenotypic features
      that may have clinical relevance for drug resistance and disease relapse.

PG  - 2139-57
LID - 10.1007/s00018-012-1161-8 [doi]
AB  - Melatonin is involved in many physiological functions and it plays an important
      role in many pathological processes as well. Melatonin has been shown to reduce
      the incidence of experimentally induced cancers and can significantly inhibit the
      growth of some human tumors, namely hormone-dependent cancers. The anticancer
      effects of melatonin have been observed in breast cancer, both in in vivo with
      models of chemically induced rat mammary tumors, and in vitro studies on human
      breast cancer cell lines. Melatonin acts at different physiological levels and
      its antitumoral properties are supported by a set of complex, different
      mechanisms of action, involving apoptosis activation, inhibition of
      proliferation, and cell differentiation.

LID - 10.1007/s13187-012-0415-3 [doi]
AB  - The aim was to obtain patients' experiences of the cancer treatment pathway at a 
      tertiary teaching hospital using unstructured journals to enable health care
      professionals to be educated on how to improve patient care. Most of 38 patients 
      (22 females and 16 males), average age of 58 (range 29-80), who returned diaries 
      were starting chemotherapy for a range of cancers. Data entries were transcribed 
      and entered into the NVIVO software to facilitate thematic analysis. Women wrote 
      more, and more often than men, and disclosed more. For most, physical side
      effects dominated, comprising 25-75 % of diary entries. The most commonly
      mentioned were fatigue (74 %), pain (63 %), sleep disturbances (50 %), nausea (45
      %) and changes in appetite (45 %). Collectively, 22 patients reported 261
      separate emotional reactions including depression, anger, guilt, shame, grief,
      panic and confusion. The treatment environment, including personnel, impacted
      upon patients. Where survival is unpredictable, evidence of consistency of
      practitioners' approaches attains heightened significance.

      perceptions.
PG  - 631-40

AB  - This study aimed to identify nurses' and patients' perceptions and compare them
      in terms of the information needs of cancer patients. Another aim is to identify 
      the association between the demographic and situational characteristics of
      patients'/nurses' and information needs. A total of 305 patients and 130 nurses
      participated in this descriptive and comparative study. Data was collected with a
      study-specific questionnaire developed for this study. Descriptive statistics,
      Pearson Chi-square and RIDIT analyses were used to analyze the data. Results
      indicated that there was incongruence between patients' and nurses' perceptions
      regarding information provision (p < 0.05), both congruence regarding how much
      information was needed (eight out of 16 information items), but also significant 
      incongruence on the remaining items(p < 0.05). The other finding was that
      patients residing out of Ankara city needed to obtain more information rather
      than the others. No relationship was found between demographic and situational
      characteristics and nurses' perceptions regarding information need of patients.

TI  - Breast cancer among shift workers: results of the WOLF longitudinal cohort study.
PG  - 170-7
LID - 10.5271/sjweh.3323 [doi]
LID - 3323 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether shift work (with or
      without night work) is associated with increased risk of breast cancer. METHODS: 
      The population consisted of 4036 women. Data were obtained from WOLF (Work,
      Lipids, and Fibrinogen), a longitudinal cohort study. Information about baseline 
      characteristics was based on questionnaire responses and medical examination.
      Cancer incidence from baseline to follow-up was obtained from the national cancer
      registry. Two exposure groups were identified: shift work with and without night 
      work. The group with day work only was used as the reference group in the
      analysis. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate relative risk. RESULTS:
      In total, 94 women developed breast cancer during follow-up. The average
      follow-up time was 12.4 years. The hazard ratio for breast cancer was 1.23 [95%
      confidence interval (95% CI) 0.70-2.17] for shifts without night work and 2.02
      (95% CI 1.03-3.95) for shifts with night work. When including only women <60
      years of age, the risk estimates were 1.18 (95% CI 0.67-2.07) for shifts without 
      night work, and 2.15 (95% CI 1.10-4.21) for shifts with night work. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our results indicate an increased risk for breast cancer among women who work
      shifts that includes night work.

TI  - Biglycan expression and clinical outcome in patients with pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 131-7
LID - 10.1007/s13277-012-0520-2 [doi]
AB  - Conflicting results have been reported on the role of extracellular matrix (ECM) 
      proteins in pancreatic cancer. Preclinical studies suggest that the
      overexpression of biglycan (proteoglycan-I, PG-I), a leucine-rich protein of the 
      ECM, may induce growth arrest of pancreatic cancer cells. The aim of this study
      was to assess the prognostic role of biglycan expression in pancreatic cancer. We
      also evaluated MIB-1 and COX-2 expressions (as potential markers of growth and
      aggressiveness) to better characterize the biology of the tumors. The classical
      pathological parameters (grading, desmoplasia, perineural, or vascular invasion) 
      as well as molecular determinants of prognosis were examined. MIB-1 (a
      proliferative index associated with prognosis in most tumors), COX-2, and PG-I
      expressions were detected by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence on
      tissue samples from 53 patients with pancreatic cancer and reviewed by two
      independent pathologists. To verify PG-I expression, three rabbit sera (LF104,
      LF112, and LF121 from NIH, Bethesda, MA, US) were tested. Logrank test and Cox's 
      model were applied for statistical analysis. Out of 53 patients, 40 had stage III
      and IV pancreatic cancer. Fourteen patients did not express any of the PG-I
      epitopes. The patients who expressed at least two PG-I epitopes had shorter
      survival compared to those with single epitope or lacking any expression (28 vs
      44 weeks, P = 0.0021). The MIB-1 higher expression predicted shorter survival (25
      vs 41 weeks, P = 0.0059). The other parameters were not associated with clinical 
      outcome. Multivariate analyses confirmed PG-I expression and MIB-1 as independent
      negative prognostic factors. Patients who presented PG-I expression in the ECM
      had the worse prognosis compared to those who did not. Our results are not in
      contrast with the hypothesis that ECM proteins are a potential barrier to
      metastatic spread in localized pancreatic cancer. Rather, we underline the
      complexity of tumor-stroma interactions in the advanced stage of cancer and the
      need of further study.

TI  - A novel blueprint for 'top down' differentiation defines the cervical
      squamocolumnar junction during development, reproductive life, and neoplasia.
PG  - 460-8
LID - 10.1002/path.4110 [doi]
AB  - The cervical squamocolumnar (SC) junction is the site of a recently discovered
      'embryonic' cell population that was proposed as the cell of origin for cervical 
      cancer and its precursors. How this population participates in cervical
      remodelling and neoplasia is unclear. In the present study, we analysed the SC
      junction immunophenotype during pre- and post-natal human and mouse development
      and in the adult, processes of metaplastic evolution of the SC junction,
      microglandular change, and early cervical neoplasia. Early in life, embryonic
      cervical epithelial cells were seen throughout the cervix and subsequently
      diminished in number to become concentrated at the SC junction in the adult. In
      all settings, there was a repetitive scenario in which cuboidal embryonic/SC
      junction cells gave rise to subjacent metaplastic basal/reserve cells with a
      switch from the SC junction positive to negative immunophenotype. This downward
      or basal (rather than upward or apical) evolution from progenitor cell to
      metaplastic progeny was termed reverse or 'top down' differentiation. A similar
      pattern was noted in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs),
      suggesting that HPV infection of the cuboidal SC junction cells initiated
      outgrowth of basally-oriented neoplastic progeny. The progressive loss of the
      embryonic/SC junction markers occurred with 'top down' differentiation during
      development, remodelling, and early neoplasia. Interestingly, most low-grade SILs
      were SC junction-negative, implying infection of metaplastic progeny rather than 
      the original SC junction cells. This proposed model of 'top down' differentiation
      resolves the mystery of how SC junction cells both remodel the cervix and
      participate in neoplasia and provides for a second population of metaplastic
      progeny (including basal and reserve cells), the infection of which is
      paradoxically less likely to produce a biologically aggressive precursor. It also
      provides new targets in animal models to determine why the SC junction is
      uniquely susceptible to carcinogenic HPV infection.

TI  - Evaluation of a patient information website for childhood cancer survivors.
PG  - 919-26
LID - 10.1007/s00520-012-1604-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Childhood cancer survivors (CCS) are in need of specialized information 
      about late effects of treatment. In the current study, we assessed the perceived 
      usability and satisfaction with the content of a national website with
      information on late effects and analyzed possible determinants related to website
      usability and content satisfaction. METHODS: CCS and their parents were contacted
      through our local follow-up program and via online media to complete an online
      questionnaire regarding their baseline characteristics, medical decision style,
      and the usability and content of the website. Usability was evaluated using the
      System Usability Scale (SUS), a validated questionnaire resulting in a score from
      0 to 100. For the content rating, we constructed a six-item scale resulting in a 
      score from 1 to 5 (Cronbach's alpha, 0.83). Comments were analyzed qualitatively.
      RESULTS: Fifty-five survivors and forty-three parents of survivors completed the 
      questionnaire. Median age of respondents was 41 years (range, 17-58). Respondents
      rated the website's usability with a mean SUS score of 72.5 (95 % CI, 69.2-74.9).
      The mean content rating was 3.7 (95 % CI, 3.5-3.8). No determinants were
      significantly related to the perceived usability or content satisfaction in
      multivariate analyses. Qualitative analysis revealed respondents' preference for 
      more detailed and even scientific information on late effects. CONCLUSION:
      Respondents were satisfied with the usability and the contents of a website that 
      targeted at their information needs. As knowledge about late effects is still
      limited among survivors, a website can be a valuable resource to improve their
      knowledge, promote healthy behavior, and in the end, improve their quality of
      life.

TI  - Risk predictors of underestimation and the need for sentinel node biopsy in
      patients diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ by preoperative needle biopsy.
PG  - 388-92
LID - 10.1002/jso.23273 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) by core needle biopsy
      showed a high rate of underestimation of invasiveness, and performing sentinel
      lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in DCIS patients was controversial. METHODS: We analyzed
      340 DCIS patients who were diagnosed by needle biopsies. Final pathology and
      clinicopathological features were reviewed. Predictors were accessed using the
      Chi-square test and a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: The overall DCIS
      underestimation rate was 42.6%. The underestimation was significantly related to 
      the palpability, mass or calcification by ultrasonography, grade, suspicious
      microinvasion, and biopsy method in univariate analysis. In multivariate
      analysis, palpability, ultrasonographic calcification or mass, suspicious
      microinvasion, and core needle biopsy were independent predictors of
      underestimation of invasive cancer. In cases with one or no risk predictors, the 
      underestimation rate was 14.3%, whereas, in those with five predictors, it
      increased to 90.9%. Among 144 invasive cancer patients who underwent axillary
      staging, 15.4% had node metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: DCIS diagnosed by preoperative
      needle biopsy has a high probability of underestimation, and 15% of invasive
      cancer patients have node metastasis. SLNB may be justified in DCIS patients
      undergoing needle biopsies, and caution should be exercised in omitting SLNB in
      patients with one or no risk predictors.

TI  - Identification of natural killer cell receptor genes in the genome of the
      marsupial Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii).
PG  - 25-35
LID - 10.1007/s00251-012-0643-z [doi]
AB  - Within the mammalian immune system, natural killer (NK) cells contribute to the
      first line of defence against infectious agents and tumours. Their activity is
      regulated, in part, by cell surface NK cell receptors. NK receptors can be
      divided into two unrelated, but functionally analogous superfamilies based on the
      structure of their extracellular ligand-binding domains. Receptors belonging to
      the C-type lectin superfamily are predominantly encoded in the natural killer
      complex (NKC), while receptors belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily are
      predominantly encoded in the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). Natural killer
      cell receptors are emerging as a rapidly evolving gene family which can display
      significant intra- and interspecific variation. To date, most studies have
      focused on eutherian mammals, with significantly less known about the evolution
      of these receptors in marsupials. Here, we describe the identification of 43
      immunoglobulin domain-containing LRC genes in the genome of the Tasmanian devil
      (Sarcophilus harrisii), the largest remaining marsupial carnivore and only the
      second marsupial species to be studied. We also identify orthologs of NKC genes
      KLRK1, CD69, CLEC4E, CLEC1B, CLEC1A and an ortholog of an opossum NKC receptor.
      Characterisation of these regions in a second, distantly related marsupial
      provides new insights into the dynamic evolutionary histories of these receptors 
      in mammals. Understanding the functional role of these genes is also important
      for the development of therapeutic agents against Devil Facial Tumour Disease, a 
      contagious cancer that threatens the Tasmanian devil with extinction.

TI  - Extract from mistletoe, Viscum album L., reduces Hsp27 and 14-3-3 protein
      expression and induces apoptosis in C6 rat glioma cells.
PG  - 2801-13
AB  - Extracts of mistletoe (Viscum album) are intensively used in complementary
      medicine, but their mechanisms are not fully understood in most cases, and the
      effects on metabolism have not been investigated in detail. However, some
      biologically active natural products are well known to provoke unexpected
      cellular responses. They reduce overexpression of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in
      cancer cells. The aim of the current study was to determine whether methanolic
      extract of V. album, which possesses antioxidant activity, has an effect on
      expression levels of Hsp27 and 14-3-3 proteins in a C6 glioma cell line. For the 
      first time, the apoptosis-inducing effect of this extract was also determined via
      caspase-3 activation in the cells. Overexpression of Hsps was induced by heat
      shock at 42 degrees C for 1 h. Expression levels of Hsp27 and 14-3-3 proteins
      were determined using Western blot analysis. The apoptosis-inducing effect was
      also evaluated via caspase-3 activation in C6 glioma cells. Pretreatment of the
      cells with a nontoxic dose (100 mug/mL) of V. album extract before heat shock
      significantly reduced expression levels of Hsp27 (73%) and 14-3-3beta (124%),
      14-3-3gamma (23%), and 14-3-3zeta (84%) proteins. Pretreatment with the extract
      before heat shock increased apoptosis via caspase-3 activation (60%) in C6 glioma
      cells. This result suggested that the methanolic extract of V. album
      downregulates expression of Hsp27 and 14-3-3 chaperone proteins and induces
      apoptosis, which warrants further exploration as a potential bioactive compound
      for cancer therapy.

TI  - Meta-analysis confirms that a common G/C variant in the pre-miR-146a gene
      contributes to cancer susceptibility and that ethnicity, gender and smoking
      status are risk factors.
PG  - 3051-62
AB  - Evidence has shown that miR-146a is involved in carcinogenesis, and a common G/C 
      variant (rs2910164) in the pre-miR-146a gene has been associated with various
      types of cancer. We summarized the data from 22 published case-control studies on
      the association between rs2910164 and cancer risk and performed subgroup analyses
      by ethnicity, gender and smoking status. We found a significant association
      between the pre-miR-146a polymorphism and cancer risk in Caucasian populations
      (odds ratio (OR) = 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.88-0.99 for G- vs
      C-allele), while the significance was borderline in Asian populations (OR = 1.11,
      95%CI = 1.00-1.23 for G- vs C-allele). A significantly increased risk of cancer
      was found in males with GG/GC genotypes (OR = 1.23, 95%CI = 1.10- 1.37), and the 
      significance was more pronounced in smokers (OR = 1.82, 95%CI = 1.32-2.51) than
      in non-smokers (OR = 1.24, 95%CI = 1.01-1.53). We conclude that there is evidence
      that the pre-miR-146a polymorphism contributes to cancer susceptibilities and
      that gender and smoking status affect the probability of cancer in individuals
      with this polymorphism.

TI  - CYP2E1 RsaI and 96-bp insertion genetic polymorphisms associated with risk for
      colorectal cancer.
PG  - 3138-45
AB  - We investigated a possible association between alcoholism, cigarette smoking,
      obesity and CYP2E1 RsaI and 96-bp insertion genetic polymorphisms with risk for
      colorectal cancer (CRC). Patients with CRC (70 women and 61 men) were matched for
      gender and age to 206 healthy controls. The mean age of the two groups was 62
      years. Meat intake, cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking were assessed using a 
      specific frequency questionnaire. The body mass index was also calculated. DNA
      was extracted from peripheral blood; RsaI polymorphism genotypes were evaluated
      by PCR-RFLP and 96-bp insertion genetic polymorphisms were evaluated by specific 
      primers. The distributions of CYP2E1 RsaI c1/c1, c1/c2 and c2/c2 genotypes were
      90.2, 9.2 and 0.6%, respectively, in controls and 83.9, 13.7 and 2.4% in CRC
      cases. Allele c2 was associated with increased risk for CRC [odds ratio (OR) =
      1.88, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 1.02-3.45]. The CYP2E1 RsaI c2/c2
      genotype was associated with an increased risk for rectal cancer (OR = 3.23,
      95%CI = 1.26-9.03). The 96-bp insertion was slightly more frequent in the CRC
      group (9.3 vs 11.4%, P = 0.19), especially in females (6.4 vs 11.5%, P = 0.34).
      Smoking, alcohol drinking or high intake of red meat and CYP2E1 polymorphisms
      were not associated with increased risk for CRC. The 96-bp insertion was
      marginally more frequent (P = 0.07) in undernourished CRC subjects. We concluded 
      that the risk for CRC is higher among individuals with allele c2. The CYP2E1 RsaI
      c2/c2 genotype was associated with an increased risk for rectal cancer.

AB  - UV-light induced skin cancer is being more and more accepted in Germany as an
      occupational disease for several jobs with increased UV-light exposure. Over the 
      past 100 years sunscreens with filters against UVB- and UVA-light have been
      developed. Another development is the use of antioxidants such as vitamin E,
      vitamin C and herbal agents for additional photoprotection. The evidence
      supporting these products in their topical and systemic formulation is very
      variable. The recent changes in the recognition of UV-induced skin cancers as
      occupational diseases increases the need for preventive strategies which are
      supported by appropriate clinical studies.

TI  - ERK-modulated intrinsic signaling and G(2)/M phase arrest contribute to the
      induction of apoptotic death by allyl isothiocyanate in MDA-MB-468 human breast
      adenocarcinoma cells.
PG  - 2065-72
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2012.1640 [doi]
AB  - Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), a member of the isothiocyanate (ITC) family found in
      a constituent of cruciferous vegetables, possesses anticancer activity and
      induces apoptosis in various types of human cancer cell lines. However, no
      available information showed antitumor effects in human breast adenocarcinoma
      cells. The current study was focused on exploring the mechanisms underlying
      AITC-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells in vitro. We found
      that AITC reduced the cell number and viability using trypan blue staining with
      the Countess Automated Cell Counter and the MTT assay, respectively. AITC also
      was found to induce apoptotic cell morphological changes by a contrast-phase
      microscope and cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M phase by flow cytometric assay in
      MDA-MB-468 cells. Intrinsic apoptosis-associated factors such as caspase-9 and
      caspase-3 activities were performed, and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      production, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Psim) occurred in
      AITC-treated MDA-MB-468 cells. AITC also stimulated mitochondria-related
      signaling, including p-Bcl-2 (Ser-70), cytochrome c and Apaf-1 in MDA-MB-468
      cells. We found that the p-ERK signal was upregulated in AITC-treated cells.
      Importantly, NAC (a ROS scavenger) and U0126 (an ERK inhibitor) abolished
      AITC-reduced viability in MDA-MB-468 cells. AITC downregulated CDK1 activity and 
      altered the expression of G(2)/M phase-modulated associated protein levels by
      western blotting in MDA-MB-468 cells. In summary, our findings demonstrated that 
      AITC-promoted G2/M phase and AITC-triggered apoptosis correlate with the
      activation of phosphorylation of ERK in MDA-MB-468 cells. AITC is a potential
      agent for applcation in the treatment of human breast cancer.

TI  - HIF-1alpha and NOTCH signaling in ductal and lobular carcinomas of the breast.
PG  - 435-42
LID - 10.1007/s13402-012-0102-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: NOTCH signaling is involved in every step of metazoan development and
      maintenance of adult tissue homeostasis. It is frequently deregulated by
      mutations and overexpression in different cancer types including solid tumors
      such as breast cancer. Another common feature of solid tumors is hypoxia, which
      occurs due to defective or insufficient vascularization. Hypoxia-inducible
      factors (HIFs) are key regulators of the homeostatic response to low oxygen
      levels. HIF-1alpha is overexpressed in many solid tumors, including breast
      cancer. Hypoxia-induced stabilization of HIF transcription factors has been shown
      to lead to NOTCH activation in vitro in different contexts and tissues, causing
      differentiation arrest and induction of proliferation and migration. METHODS:
      Since the link between HIF-1alpha and NOTCH signalling has hardly been studied,
      we set out to closely investigate associations between the expression of
      HIF-1alpha and NOTCH pathway members in primary and metastatic human breast
      cancer specimens and their prognostic value. RESULTS: Co-expression of NOTCH1
      intracellular domain (N1ICD) and HIF-1alpha was associated with a high grade and 
      a high proliferation rate in invasive breast cancer. HIF-1alpha expression was
      low in classic, but high in pleomorphic lobular cancers, which also frequently
      showed stromal HIF-1alpha expression. NOTCH1 pathway activation was
      prognostically unfavorable. CONCLUSION: In breast cancer, NOTCH pathway
      activation appears to be associated with a poor prognosis, but NOTCH and HIF
      signaling do not seem to be functionally associated.

PG  - 152-7
LID - 10.1002/lary.23570 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate the responsiveness of human papillomavirus
      (HPV) -positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer to intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy (IMRT), using axial imaging obtained daily during the course of
      image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT). STUDY DESIGN: Observational cohort study with
      matched-pair analysis of patients irradiated for HPV-positive and HPV-negative
      oropharygeal cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients treated by IMRT to 70 Gy
      for locally advanced, HPV-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx were
      matched to one HPV-negative control subject by age, gender, performance status,
      T-category, tumor location, and the use of concurrent chemotherapy. The gross
      tumor volume (GTV) was delineated on daily IGRT scans obtained via kilovoltage
      cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Mathematical modeling using fitted
      mixed-effects repeated measure analysis was performed to quantitatively and
      descriptively assess the trajectory of tumor regression. RESULTS: Patients with
      HPV-positive tumors experienced a more rapid rate of tumor regression between day
      1 of IMRT and the beginning of week 2 (-33% Delta GTV) compared to their
      counterparts with HPV-negative tumors (-10% Delta GTV), which was statistically
      significant (p<0.001). During this initial period, the average absolute change in
      GTV was -22.9 cc/week for HPV-positive tumors and -5.9 cc/week for HPV-negative
      tumors (p<0.001). After week 2 of IMRT, the rates of GTV regression were
      comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: HPV-positive oropharyngeal
      cancers exhibited an enhanced response to radiation, characterized by a
      dramatically more rapid initial regression than those with HPV-negative tumors.
      Implications for treatment de-intensification in the context of future clinical
      trials and the possible mechanisms underlying this increased radiosensitivity
      will be discussed.

AB  - A facile and green approach is reported to construct
      pixantrone/poly(gamma-glutamic acid) nanoparticles (PIX/gamma-PGA NPs) as an oral
      drug delivery system through the complex self-assembly of polyelectrolyte
      gamma-PGA and the anticancer drug pixantrone dimaleate (PDM). The complex
      self-assembly behavior is investigated in detail. The results demonstrate that
      PDM can interact with gamma-PGA to conveniently form NPs and the size of NPs can 
      be controlled by adjusting the solution volume ratio of PDM to gamma-PGA. These
      NPs illustrate their pH-dependent release behavior, efficient cellular uptake and
      enhanced drug efficacy through an in vitro release study, flow cytometry, CLSM
      analysis and the MTT assay. In summary, PIX/gamma-PGA NPs may serve as a
      promising oral drug delivery system for cancer therapy.

TI  - Pituitary metastasis of thyroid cancer.
PG  - 485-93
LID - 10.1007/s12020-012-9806-9 [doi]
AB  - Pituitary metastases (PM) from thyroid cancer are rare, but their management can 
      represent a difficult challenge for the endocrinologist. Our aim was to review
      all reported cases of PM from thyroid cancer. PubMed was consulted and 19 papers 
      reporting 20 cases were found. We moreover discuss two of our own cases, which
      had come to our attention within a few months of one another. Eleven cases were
      follicular cancer, eight cases were papillary cancer, two cases were medullary
      cancer, and one case was an insular cancer. In nine cases, PM was the first sign 
      of the disease. Cranial nerve involvement was the most common sign of its
      presence, and no neuroradiological imaging could lead to a sure diagnosis of PM. 
      Neurosurgical intervention was performed in almost all cases, and post-surgical
      treatment comprised radioiodine, external beam radiotherapy, and radiosurgery.
      Prognosis was poor for larger metastases, cranial nerve palsy disappeared in only
      one case, and in only one case of intrasellar metastasis was the disease cured.
      PM from thyroid cancer are rare, but are burdened by a poor prognosis. An early
      diagnosis appears important, and a comprehensive strategy for treatment
      (neurosurgery, radioiodine, external radiotherapy, and radiosurgery) appears
      advisable.

AB  - Breast cancer initiation, invasion and metastasis span multiple length and time
      scales. Molecular events at short length scales lead to an initial tumorigenic
      population, which left unchecked by immune action, acts at increasingly longer
      length scales until eventually the cancer cells escape from the primary tumor
      site. This series of events is highly complex, involving multiple cell types
      interacting with (and shaping) the microenvironment. Multiscale mathematical
      models have emerged as a powerful tool to quantitatively integrate the
      convective-diffusion-reaction processes occurring on the systemic scale, with the
      molecular signaling processes occurring on the cellular and subcellular scales.
      In this study, we reviewed the current state of the art in cancer modeling across
      multiple length scales, with an emphasis on the integration of intracellular
      signal transduction models with pro-tumorigenic chemical and mechanical
      microenvironmental cues. First, we reviewed the underlying biomolecular origin of
      breast cancer, with a special emphasis on angiogenesis. Then, we summarized the
      development of tissue engineering platforms which could provide high-fidelity ex 
      vivo experimental models to identify and validate multiscale simulations. Lastly,
      we reviewed top-down and bottom-up multiscale strategies that integrate
      subcellular networks with the microenvironment. We present models of a variety of
      cancers, in addition to breast cancer specific models. Taken together, we expect 
      as the sophistication of the simulations increase, that multiscale modeling and
      bottom-up agent-based models in particular will become an increasingly important 
      platform technology for basic scientific discovery, as well as the identification
      and validation of potentially novel therapeutic targets.

      hydrazine-induced rat colon carcinogenesis.
PG  - 196-207

AB  - Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of tumour-related deaths. In the
      present study, the chemopreventive effect of green tea on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine
      (DMH)-induced colon carcinogenesis was studied in male Wistar rats. The DMH group
      received subcutaneous injections of DMH (30 mg kg(-1) body weight) once a week
      for 30 weeks, the normal group received the vehicle of DMH, and the DMH + green
      tea group received DMH simultaneously with 1% green tea as their sole source of
      drinking fluid throughout the experimental period. In the DMH group treated with 
      green tea, significant reductions in gene overexpressions of colonic nuclear
      factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), tumour necrosis factor alpha, inducible nitric oxide
      synthase and cyclooxygenase 2, and NF-kappaB immunostaining indicates the
      anti-inflammatory effect of green tea in attenuating colon cancer. Moreover, the 
      anti-angiogenic and anti-invasiveness effects of green tea were revealed as
      reductions of both vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix
      metalloproteinase-7 mRNA expression levels. These effects were confirmed by the
      significant reduction of serum tumour necrosis factor alpha, C-reactive protein
      levels, inhibition of tumour incidence, and nearly normal survival rate and
      colonic architecture. It can be concluded that green tea exerts a potent
      chemopreventive effect on colon carcinogenesis possibly due to the inhibition of 
      NF-kappaB.

TI  - A fabricated forearm free flap with accompanying phonation tube for simultaneous 
      reconstruction of a pharyngolaryngeal circumferential defect and voice loss: new 
      surgical modification with functional phonation outcome.
PG  - 344-9
LID - 10.1002/lary.23631 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Total pharyngolaryngectomy is potentially ablative surgery, resulting
      in compromise of some most basic functions of life, including speech and
      swallowing. Tracheoesophageal puncture is the gold standard for voice
      restoration. But it still has prosthesis-related problems. OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS:
      We designed a uniquely customized radial forearm free flap (RFFF), which also
      incorporated a region for phonation tube (PT) creation, for the dual purpose of
      circumferential laryngopharyngeal defect reconstruction and voice production.
      METHODS: From August 2005 to September 2010, there were 18 male patients with
      late-stage hypopharyngeal cancer (HPC) or laryngeal cancer (LC) who received
      one-stage reconstruction with the fabricated RFFF-accompanying PT after total
      pharyngolaryngectomy. We recorded the phonation outcome of phonation efficacy
      (PE) and maximal phonation time (MPT) postoperatively within 1 month and at least
      1 year after surgery. RESULTS: Nine patients suffered from HPC and the others
      suffered from LC. Twelve patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy after
      surgery. The follow-up time was 12 to 56 months (mean 28.7 months). There was no 
      significant variance in the PE (79.72%, SD=21.93% vs. 62.50%, SD=39.60%,
      respectively; p = 0.115) and MPT (2.58 seconds, SD=1.80 vs. 2.97 seconds,
      SD=3.96, respectively; p = 0.878) between the first and last follow-up points,
      even when the patients were grouped by radiotherapy status after surgery or by
      disease group. CONCLUSIONS: The phonation outcome in our experience was
      satisfactory and it tolerated postoperative radiotherapy during at least the
      12-month follow-up period.

AB  - Intra-operative delineation of breast cancer is a challenging problem. We used
      dye-enhanced wide-field polarization imaging for rapid demarcation of en face
      cancer margins and optical coherence tomography (OCT) for cross-sectional
      evaluation. Ductal carcinoma specimens were stained with methylene blue.
      Wide-field reflectance images were acquired at 440 and 640 nm. Wide-field
      fluorescence images were excited at 640 nm and registered between 660 nm and 750 
      nm. OCT images were acquired using a 1310 nm swept-source system. The results
      were validated against histopathology. Both imaging modalities provided
      diagnostic information on cancer margins. Combined OCT and wide-field
      polarization imaging shows promise for intra-operative detection of ductal breast
      carcinoma.

TI  - A multichannel Markov random field framework for tumor segmentation with an
      application to classification of gene expression-based breast cancer recurrence
      risk.
PG  - 637-48
LID - 10.1109/TMI.2012.2219589 [doi]
AB  - We present a methodological framework for multichannel Markov random fields
      (MRFs). We show that conditional independence allows loopy belief propagation to 
      solve a multichannel MRF as a single channel MRF. We use conditional mutual
      information to search for features that satisfy conditional independence
      assumptions. Using this framework we incorporate kinetic feature maps derived
      from breast dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging as observation
      channels in MRF for tumor segmentation. Our algorithm based on multichannel MRF
      achieves an receiver operating characteristic area under curve (AUC) of 0.97 for 
      tumor segmentation when using a radiologist's manual delineation as ground truth.
      Single channel MRF based on the best feature chosen from the same pool of
      features as used by the multichannel MRF achieved a lower AUC of 0.89. We also
      present a comparison against the well established normalized cuts segmentation
      algorithm along with commonly used approaches for breast tumor segmentation
      including fuzzy C-means (FCM) and the more recent method of running FCM on
      enhancement variance features (FCM-VES). These previous methods give a lower AUC 
      of 0.92, 0.88, and 0.60, respectively. Finally, we also investigate the role of
      superior segmentation in feature extraction and tumor characterization.
      Specifically, we examine the effect of improved segmentation on predicting the
      probability of breast cancer recurrence as determined by a validated tumor gene
      expression assay. We demonstrate that an support vector machine classifier
      trained on kinetic statistics extracted from tumors as segmented by our algorithm
      gives a significant improvement in distinguishing between women with high and low
      recurrence risk, giving an AUC of 0.88 as compared to 0.79, 0.76, 0.75, and 0.66 
      when using normalized cuts, single channel MRF, FCM, and FCM-VES, respectively,
      for segmentation.

AB  - It has now been more than 5 years since the Institute of Medicine (IOM) laid out 
      its bold vision of comprehensive survivorship care. Although there is clearly
      more attention paid to this phase of the cancer journey than previously,
      implementation of the IOM recommendations has proved difficult. In this article, 
      we review some of the challenges to providing survivorship care and discuss
      efforts to prioritize the most essential elements.

      future strategies.
PG  - 4026-34
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2012.41.9242 [doi]
AB  - Angiogenesis has long been considered an important target for cancer therapy.
      Initial efforts have primarily focused on targeting of endothelial and
      tumor-derived vascular endothelial growth factor signaling. As evidence emerges
      that angiogenesis has significant mechanistic complexity, therapeutic resistance 
      and escape have become practical limitations to drug development. Here, we review
      the mechanisms by which dynamic changes occur in the tumor microenvironment in
      response to antiangiogenic therapy, leading to drug resistance. These mechanisms 
      include direct selection of clonal cell populations with the capacity to rapidly 
      upregulate alternative proangiogenic pathways, increased invasive capacity, and
      intrinsic resistance to hypoxia. The implications of normalization of vasculature
      with subsequently improved vascular function as a result of antiangiogenic
      therapy are explored, as are the implications of the ability to incorporate and
      co-opt otherwise normal vasculature. Finally, we consider the extent to which a
      better understanding of the biology of hypoxia and reoxygenation, as well as the 
      depth and breadth of systems invested in angiogenesis, may offer putative
      biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets. Insights gained through this work may
      offer solutions for personalizing antiangiogenesis approaches and improving the
      outcome of patients with cancer.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to combine clinicopathologic variables
      associated with overall survival after gastric resection with D2 lymphadenectomy 
      (D2 gastrectomy) for gastric cancer into a prediction nomogram. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 7,954 patients who underwent D2 gastrectomy 
      for gastric cancer at Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) in Seoul, Korea. 
      Two thirds of the patients were randomly assigned to the training set (n =
      5,300), and one third were assigned to the validation set (n = 2,654).
      Multivariate analysis by Cox proportional hazards regression was performed using 
      the training set, and the nomogram was constructed. Discrimination and
      calibration were performed using the SNUH validation set. Additional external
      validation was performed using the data set (n = 2,500) from Cancer Institute
      Ariake Hospital (CIAH) in Tokyo, Japan. RESULTS: The multivariate Cox model
      identified age at diagnosis, sex, location, depth of invasion, number of
      metastatic lymph nodes, and number of examined lymph nodes as covariates
      associated with survival. In the SNUH validation set, the nomogram exhibited
      superior discrimination power compared with the seventh American Joint Committee 
      on Cancer TNM classification (Harrell's C-index, 0.78 v 0.69, respectively; P <
      .001). Calibration of the nomogram predicted survival corresponding closely with 
      the actual survival. In the CIAH validation set, discrimination was good
      (C-index, 0.79), and the predicted survival was within a 10% margin of ideal
      nomogram. CONCLUSION: We developed a nomogram predicting 5- and 10-year overall
      survival after D2 gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Validation using the SNUH and
      CIAH data sets revealed good discrimination and calibration, suggesting good
      clinical utility. The nomogram improved individualized predictions of survival.

TI  - Second malignant neoplasms: assessment and strategies for risk reduction.
PG  - 3734-45
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2012.41.8681 [doi]
AB  - Improvements in early detection, supportive care, and treatment have resulted in 
      an increasing number of cancer survivors, with a current 5-year relative survival
      rate for all cancers combined of approximately 66.1%. For some patients, these
      survival advances have been offset by the long-term late effects of cancer and
      its treatment, with second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) comprising one of the most 
      potentially life-threatening sequelae. The number of patients with SMNs is
      growing, with new SMNs now representing about one in six of all cancers reported 
      to the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
      (SEER) Program. SMNs reflect not only the late effects of therapy but also the
      influence of shared etiologic factors (in particular, tobacco and excessive
      alcohol intake), genetic susceptibility, environmental exposures, host effects,
      and combinations of factors, including gene-environment interactions. For
      selected SMNs, risk is also modified by age at exposure and attained age. SMNs
      can be categorized into three major groups according to the predominant etiologic
      factor(s): (1) treatment-related, (2) syndromic, and (3) those due to shared
      etiologic exposures, although the nonexclusivity of these groups should be
      underscored. Here we provide an overview of SMNs in survivors of adult-onset
      cancer, summarizing the current, albeit limited, clinical evidence with regard to
      screening and prevention, with a focus on the provision of guidance for health
      care providers. The growing number of patients with second (and higher-order)
      cancers mandates that we also further probe etiologic influences and genetic
      variants that heighten risk, and that we better define high-risk groups for
      targeted preventive and interventional clinical strategies.

TI  - Estrogen plus progestin and colorectal cancer incidence and mortality.
PG  - 3983-90
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2012.42.7732 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: During the intervention phase in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI)
      clinical trial, use of estrogen plus progestin reduced the colorectal cancer
      diagnosis rate, but the cancers were found at a substantially higher stage. To
      assess the clinical relevance of the findings, analyses of the influence of
      combined hormone therapy on colorectal cancer incidence and colorectal cancer
      mortality were conducted after extended follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The WHI 
      study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving
      16,608 postmenopausal women with an intact uterus who were randomly assigned to
      daily 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate
      (n = 8,506) or matching placebo (n = 8,102). Colorectal cancer diagnosis rates
      and colorectal cancer mortality were assessed. RESULTS: After a mean of 5.6 years
      (standard deviation [SD], 1.03 years) of intervention and 11.6 years (SD, 3.1
      years) of total follow-up, fewer colorectal cancers were diagnosed in the
      combined hormone therapy group compared with the placebo group (diagnoses/year,
      0.12% v 0.16%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.94; P = .014). Bowel
      screening examinations were comparable between groups throughout. Cancers in the 
      combined hormone therapy group more commonly had positive lymph nodes (50.5% v
      28.6%; P < .001) and were at higher stage (regional or distant, 68.8% v 51.4%; P 
      = .003). Although not statistically significant, there was a higher number of
      colorectal cancer deaths in the combined hormone therapy group (37 v 27 deaths;
      0.04% v 0.03%; HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.78 to 2.11; P = .320). CONCLUSION: The
      findings, suggestive of diagnostic delay, do not support a clinically meaningful 
      benefit for combined hormone therapy on colorectal cancer.

LID - 10.1200/JCO.2012.42.3038 [doi]
AB  - This review highlights long-term and late consequences of hematopoietic cell
      transplantation (HCT) as well as strategies to manage or prevent complications
      that are more prevalent after HCT than most other cancer treatments. Chronic
      graft-versus-host disease stands out as a unique late effect of allogeneic HCT
      that is not seen after other types of cancer treatment. However, many other
      complications seen after solid tumor treatments are also common after HCT,
      including infections, second cancers, bone loss, and cardiovascular, pulmonary,
      renal, and endocrine dysfunction. Symptoms and syndromes that are reported after 
      HCT include sexual dysfunction, cognitive problems, fatigue, insomnia,
      musculoskeletal symptoms, emotional distress, anger, and depression. Addressing
      these complex potential or actual complications requires diligent routine health 
      care to intervene early or, when possible, to prevent late complications. To
      accomplish early detection and prevention of life-threatening complications, HCT 
      survivors should undergo an annual comprehensive physical examination that
      includes screening for functional and psychosocial consequences of treatment and 
      encouraging healthy lifestyle behaviors. Clinicians can link survivors to
      numerous online, print, and video resources to help them advocate for their
      health needs.

PG  - 3657-64
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2012.45.2938 [doi]
AB  - Cardiac toxicities from cancer therapy can become evident many years after
      treatment, and these late cardiac effects can have a profound impact on cancer
      survivors. There are a myriad of potential cardiovascular complications from
      cancer therapy, but these can be grouped into three main categories. First,
      vascular conditions including atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and hypertension
      predominate. Second, cardiac structural problems, especially valvular
      degeneration, can have a dramatic impact long term. Lastly, and most importantly,
      cardiac dysfunction and heart failure are potentially common late cardiac effects
      and can certainly be prevented or detected early during active cancer therapy to 
      result in optimal outcomes. Future research on late cardiac effects in cancer
      survivors needs to include advanced cardiac imaging techniques, novel cardiac
      biomarkers, and genetic determinants of response to cancer treatment.

TI  - Cancer-related lymphedema risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and impact: a
      review.
PG  - 3726-33
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2012.41.8574 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE Cancer-related lymphedema (LE) is an incurable condition associated with 
      lymph-involved cancer treatments and is an increasing health, quality of life
      (QOL), and cost burden on a growing cancer survivor population. This review
      examines the evidence for causes, risk, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and
      impact of this largely unexamined survivorship concern. METHODS PubMed and
      Medline were searched for cancer-related LE literature published since 1990 in
      English. The resulting references (N = 726) were evaluated for strength of
      design, methods, sample size, and recent publication and sorted into categories
      (ie, causes/prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and QOL). Sixty studies were
      included. Results Exercise and physical activity and sentinel lymph node biopsy
      reduce risk, and overweight and obesity increase risk. Evidence that
      physiotherapy reduces risk and that lymph node status and number of malignant
      nodes increase risk is less strong. Perometry and bioimpedence emerged as
      attractive diagnostic technologies, replacing the use of water displacement in
      clinical practice. Swelling can also be assessed by measuring arm circumference
      and relying on self-report. Symptoms can be managed, not cured, with complex
      physical therapy, low-level laser therapy, pharmacotherapy, and surgery. Sequelae
      of LE negatively affect physical and mental QOL and range in severity. However,
      the majority of reviewed studies involved patients with breast cancer; therefore,
      results may not be applicable to all cancers. CONCLUSION Research into causes,
      prevention, and effect on QOL of LE and information on LE in cancers other than
      breast is needed. Consensus on definitions and measurement, increased patient and
      provider awareness of signs and symptoms, and proper and prompt treatment/access,
      including psychosocial support, are needed to better understand, prevent, and
      treat LE.

TI  - Noninitiation of adjuvant chemotherapy in women with localized breast cancer: the
      breast cancer quality of care study.
PG  - 3800-9
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2012.43.8168 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: For some women, adjuvant chemotherapy for nonmetastatic breast cancer
      decreases recurrences and increases survival; however, patient-physician
      decisions regarding chemotherapy receipt can be influenced by medical and
      nonmedical factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used a prospective cohort design and
      multivariate modeling to investigate factors related to noninitiation of
      chemotherapy among women with newly diagnosed breast cancer recruited from three 
      US sites. We interviewed patients at baseline and during treatment on
      sociodemographic, tumor, and treatment decision-making factors. Patients were
      categorized according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines as
      those for whom chemotherapy was definitely indicated, clinically discretionary,
      or discretionary based on age greater than 70 years. RESULTS: Of 1,145 patients
      recruited, chemotherapy was clinically indicated for 392 patients, clinically
      discretionary for 459 patients, discretionary because of age for 169 patients,
      and not indicated for 93 patients; data were insufficient for 32 patients.
      Chemotherapy rates were 90% for those in whom chemotherapy was clinically
      indicated, 36% for those in whom it was discretionary because of clinical
      factors, and 19% for those in whom it was discretionary based on age greater than
      70 years. Nonreceipt of chemotherapy was associated with older age, more negative
      beliefs about treatment efficacy, less positive beliefs about chemotherapy, and
      more concern about adverse effects. In the two discretionary groups, clinical
      predictors of worse outcome (greater tumor size, positive nodes, worse grade, and
      estrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor-negative status) were associated
      with increased chemotherapy initiation. CONCLUSION: Utilization of adjuvant
      chemotherapy was most common among patients who, based on clinical criteria,
      would most likely benefit from it, patients with more positive than negative
      beliefs regarding treatment efficacy, and patients with few concerns about
      adverse effects.

LID - 10.1200/JCO.2012.43.0116 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive changes associated with cancer and cancer treatments have become an
      increasing concern. Using breast cancer as the prototype, we reviewed the
      research from neuropsychological, imaging, genetic, and animal studies that have 
      examined pre- and post-treatment cognitive change. An impressive body of research
      supports the contention that a subgroup of patients is vulnerable to
      post-treatment cognitive problems. We also propose that models of aging may be a 
      useful conceptual framework for guiding research in this area and suggest that a 
      useful perspective may be viewing cognitive change in patients with cancer within
      the context of factors that influence the trajectory of normal aging.

PG  - 3665-74
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2012.42.2097 [doi]
AB  - Optimizing health outcomes, including prevention of osteoporotic fractures, is
      essential for promoting the well-being of the growing number of cancer survivors.
      Medical providers who participate in the care of cancer survivors should be aware
      that various cancer treatments may cause bone loss, which can increase the risk
      of subsequent of osteoporosis. Healthy bone remodeling is a balanced and dynamic 
      equation between new bone formation and bone resorption. Aging, natural
      menopause, and cancer treatments such as surgical oophorectomy,
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure,
      androgen deprivation therapy, and aromatase inhibitors can all promote bone loss.
      The WHO Fracture Assessment Tool can be used as a clinical aid to assess an
      individual's osteoporotic fracture risk, with or without bone mineral density
      measurements obtained from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Preventative
      strategies include adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation and modifying
      risk factors such as alcohol intake, tobacco use, and lack of exercise.
      Bisphosphonate therapy and rank-ligand monoclonal antibody therapy are the most
      commonly used agents for management of bone loss resulting from cancer treatment.
      This review will summarize the mechanisms by which cancer treatments cause bone
      loss as well provide screening and treatment recommendations for the management
      of bone loss.

TI  - Tumor grade is associated with venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer:
      results from the Vienna Cancer and Thrombosis Study.
PG  - 3870-5
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2011.40.1810 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Patients with cancer are at risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE).
      Tumor-related factors could help estimate patients' individual risk for VTE.
      Currently, only scarce information on the association between tumor grade and VTE
      is available. We thus evaluated the role of tumor grade and its association with 
      VTE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Vienna Cancer and Thrombosis Study is a
      prospective, observational cohort study including patients with newly diagnosed
      cancer or progression of disease after remission. Study end point is the
      occurrence of symptomatic VTE. RESULTS: Seven hundred forty-seven patients with
      solid tumors received follow-up for a median of 526 days. VTE occurred in 52
      patients (7.0%). At study inclusion, 468 patients had low-grade tumors (G1 and
      G2) and 279 had high-grade tumors (G3 and G4). In multivariable Cox regression
      analysis including tumor grade, tumor histology, tumor sites, stage, sex, and
      age, patients with high-grade tumors had a significantly higher risk of VTE
      compared with those with low-grade tumors (hazard ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.5;
      P = .015). The cumulative probability of developing VTE after 6 months was higher
      in patients with high-grade tumors than in those with low-grade tumors (8.2% v
      4.0%; log-rank test P = .037). Patients with high-grade tumors had higher D-dimer
      levels (P = .008) and leukocyte counts (P < .001), and lower hemoglobin levels (P
      = .008). CONCLUSION: The tumor grade may help identify patients with cancer who
      are at high risk of VTE. The association of tumor grade with recently identified 
      biomarkers indicates a link between tumor differentiation and pathogenesis of
      cancer-associated VTE.

PG  - 3697-704
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2012.42.0638 [doi]
AB  - Lifestyle factors have been linked to the risk of developing many common
      malignancies and, increasingly, to prognosis. Observational evidence has shown a 
      relationship between so-called energy balance factors (ie, diet, physical
      activity, and body weight) and risk of cancer recurrence and mortality in cancers
      of the breast, prostate, colon and, perhaps, other cancers. Interventional work
      has shown that individuals who make favorable changes in these lifestyle factors 
      after cancer diagnosis feel better, experience less fatigue, and may possibly
      even decrease risk of cancer recurrence. Other lifestyle behaviors, such as
      smoking and alcohol consumption, have also been linked to the development of
      common cancers and may have important health consequences for cancer survivors.
      This article reviews the evidence that links lifestyle factors to cancer
      outcomes, provides clinical recommendations for cancer survivors, and describes
      future directions for lifestyle research in cancer survivors.

AB  - Germ cell testicular cancer (TC) represents a malignancy with high cure rates.
      Since the introduction of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in the late 1970s, the
      5-year survival rate has increased considerably, and it is currently above 95%.
      Because TC is usually diagnosed before the age of 40 years, these men can expect 
      to live for another 40 to 50 years after being successfully treated. This
      success, however, is hampered by an increased risk of long-term and late effects 
      of treatment. Secondary malignant neoplasms and cardiovascular disease represent 
      the most common potentially life-threatening late effects, typically occurring
      more than 10 years after treatment. Other long-term effects include pulmonary
      toxicity, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, decreased fertility, hypogonadism, and
      psychosocial problems. The incidence and time to onset of these various adverse
      effects vary according to treatment type and intensity. There is still little
      knowledge about underlying mechanisms and genetic susceptibility of the various
      adverse effects. Apart from treatment burden, it is not yet possible to identify 
      patients who are at high risk for certain late effects after TC treatment. In
      this clinical review, we present the current status regarding different somatic
      and psychosocial long-term late effects after treatment for TC, based on Medline 
      searches and our own research. Moreover, we postulate recommendations for general
      medical evaluations that should begin after treatment is completed and continue
      during follow-up.

AB  - The impact of oncologic treatments on fertility and menopausal symptoms is often 
      significant for patients with cancer. Surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy can
      all damage the reproductive organs or the hypothalamic pituitary axis that
      controls them, impairing fertility and causing hormonally mediated symptoms such 
      as hot flashes. Understanding these risks and strategies to mitigate them may
      substantially improve cancer survivorship care. For both female and male patients
      who desire a future biologic child, there are a variety of fertility preservation
      techniques that should be considered. For cancer survivors who experience
      menopausal symptoms, lifestyle changes may be beneficial, and hormonal and
      nonhormonal pharmacologic agents are well proven to reduce symptom burden.

AB  - Patients with cancer suffer from a variety of symptoms associated with both
      cancer and its treatment. These symptoms may lead to a decreased quality of life 
      for patients and can affect compliance with cancer therapies. The importance of
      adequately treating cancer-related symptoms is gaining more attention but,
      overall, many symptoms remain underdiagnosed and undertreated. Fatigue, insomnia,
      neuropathy, and pain are among the most common troublesome symptoms experienced
      by cancer survivors. This article will focus on the management of these symptoms,
      including an assessment of the current research and proposed best- management
      practices.

TI  - Sexuality in adult cancer survivors: challenges and intervention.
PG  - 3712-9
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2012.41.7915 [doi]
AB  - Sexual dysfunction is one of the most common and distressing consequences of
      cancer treatment. Although some treatment-related sexual adverse effects are
      short-term, many survivors face long-term effects such as treatment-induced
      menopause, altered gonadal function, and significant surgical disfigurement.
      Profound sexual dysfunction has been shown to have a significant negative effect 
      on quality of life. Although these problems have been well documented and there
      are a range of intervention strategies that can help patients cope with
      treatment-related sexual problems, many survivors do not feel prepared for
      potential sexual changes and often do not receive adequate support to manage
      sexual dysfunction. Numerous barriers contribute to this underprovided aspect of 
      survivorship care, including lack of provider training and access to readily
      available resources. In addition, psychological, relational, and cultural factors
      significantly influence sexuality but are often not taken into consideration in
      research and clinical practice. By taking an integrative approach and providing
      survivors with appropriate screening, information, and support, sexual
      dysfunction and accompanying distress can be significantly alleviated. In this
      article, we aim to provide a concise review of the most common sexual problems
      experienced by survivors and highlight some of the most promising evidence-based 
      practices for assessment and intervention. We also address limitations
      encountered in research and practice and explore future directions, including
      suggestions for adopting an integrative treatment model to address sexual
      dysfunction in a cancer survivorship treatment setting.

TI  - Open-label, multicenter, randomized phase III trial of adjuvant chemoradiation
      plus interferon Alfa-2b versus fluorouracil and folinic acid for patients with
      resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 4077-83
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2011.38.2960 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Adjuvant chemotherapy prolongs survival in patients with pancreatic
      cancer, but its benefit is limited. Long-term survival times of up to 44 months
      after adjuvant chemoradioimmunotherapy in phase II trials motivated the present
      study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2004 and 2007, 132 R0/R1 resected patients
      received either fluorouracil (FU), cisplatin, and interferon alfa-2b (IFN
      alpha-2b) plus radiotherapy followed by two cycles of FU (arm A, n=64) or six
      cycles of FU monotherapy (arm B, n=68). One hundred ten patients (arm A, n=53;
      arm B, n=57) received at least one dose of the study medication, and these
      patients composed the per-protocol (PP) population. Biomarkers were analyzed
      longitudinally for their predictive value. RESULTS: Median survival for all
      randomly assigned patients was 26.5 months (95% CI, 21.6 to 39.5 months) in arm A
      and 28.5 months (95% CI, 20.4 to 38.6 months) in arm B. The hazard ratio was 1.04
      (arm A v arm B: 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.53; P=.99). Median survival for the PP
      population was 32.1 months (95% CI, 22.8 to 42.2 months) in arm A and 28.5 months
      (95% CI, 19.5 to 38.6 months) in arm B (P=.49). Eighty-five percent of patients
      in arm A and 16% of patients in arm B experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicity. The
      quality of life was temporarily negatively affected in arm A. CONCLUSION: The FU,
      cisplatin, and IFN alpha-2b plus radiotherapy regimen did not improve the
      survival compared with FU monotherapy. Given the substantial adverse effects,
      this treatment can currently not be recommended. Nevertheless, the outcome in
      both arms represents the best survival, to our knowledge, ever reported for
      patients with resected pancreatic cancer in randomized controlled trials. Future 
      studies will demonstrate whether immune response to IFN alpha-2b challenge has a 
      predictive value.

AB  - There are more than 2 million prostate cancer survivors in the United States.
      Primary therapy with surgery or radiation results in permanent changes in sexual 
      function. More than half of these men are subsequently treated with androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT) at some point. The addition of ADT further compromises 
      sexuality, intimacy, and a couple's relationship. This review will highlight the 
      challenges faced by patients and couples and reveal the tremendous need for
      better education of physicians, patients, and couples as well as for more
      research in sexuality and intimacy with the goal of improving quality of life for
      this large population of survivors. Suggestions for clinicians to better help
      patients and their partners regarding sexuality and intimacy are offered.

TI  - Single-incision transaxillary robotic thyroidectomy: challenges and limitations
      in a North American population.
PG  - 1041-6
LID - 10.1177/0194599812461610 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We reviewed our initial experience with robotic thy-roidectomy to
      identify challenges and limitations of this new surgical approach when applied to
      a North American population. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Academic
      institution. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Retrospective review of 18 consecutive robotic
      thyroid lobectomies performed from February 2010 to April 2012 involving 16
      female patients. Two patients underwent robot-assisted completion thyroidectomy a
      few months following the initial thyroid surgery, one for cancer and the other
      for goiter. RESULTS: Median age was 47.5 years (range, 18-62 years), and median
      body mass index was 28.7 (range, 19.4-44.5). Median thyroid nodule size was 2.9
      cm (range, 1.1-4.7 cm). All but 1 case (6%) was performed successfully via single
      axillary incision. There was no conversion to an open approach. Median operative 
      time was 170 minutes (range, 95-220 minutes), and median blood loss was 12.5 mL
      (range, 5-75 mL). Complications occurred in 4 cases (22%) to include temporary
      vocal cord pareses (n = 3) and a postoperative hematoma that required
      exploration. Median hospital stay was 2 days (range, 1-3 days). CONCLUSION:
      Single-incision transaxillary robotic thyroidectomy can be technically
      challenging in North American patients with a larger body frame due to difficulty
      in optimal placement of all 4 robotic instruments via a single axillary incision.
      All 3 cases of temporary vocal cord paresis occurred early in our experience and 
      may have been due to our relative inexperience with this new approach and
      associated instrumentation. Other limitations include less than optimal
      visualization of the recurrent laryngeal nerve in the contralateral lobe as well 
      as poor access to the substernal region. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

TI  - Prostate cancer mortality following active surveillance versus immediate radical 
      prostatectomy.
PG  - 5471-8
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1502 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: [corrected] Active surveillance has been endorsed for low-risk prostate 
      cancer, but information about long-term outcomes and comparative effectiveness of
      active surveillance is lacking. The purpose of this study is to project prostate 
      cancer mortality under active surveillance followed by radical prostatectomy
      versus under immediate radical prostatectomy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A simulation
      model was developed to combine information on time from diagnosis to treatment
      under active surveillance and associated disease progression from a Johns Hopkins
      active surveillance cohort (n = 769), time from radical prostatectomy to
      recurrence from cases in the CaPSURE database with T-stage </= T2a (n = 3,470),
      and time from recurrence to prostate cancer death from a T-stage </= T2a Johns
      Hopkins cohort of patients whose disease recurred after radical prostatectomy (n 
      = 963). Results were projected for a hypothetical cohort aged 40 to 90 years with
      low-risk prostate cancer (T-stage </= T2a, Gleason score </= 6, and
      prostate-specific antigen level </= 10 ng/mL). RESULTS: The model projected that 
      2.8% of men on active surveillance and 1.6% of men with immediate radical
      prostatectomy would die of their disease in 20 years. Corresponding lifetime
      estimates were 3.4% for active surveillance and 2.0% for immediate radical
      prostatectomy. The average projected increase in life expectancy associated with 
      immediate radical prostatectomy was 1.8 months. On average, the model projected
      that men on active surveillance would remain free of treatment for an additional 
      6.4 years relative to men treated immediately. CONCLUSIONS: Active surveillance
      is likely to produce a very modest decline in prostate cancer-specific survival
      among men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer but could lead to significant
      benefits in terms of quality of life.

TI  - Correlates of cervical cancer screening among Vietnamese American women.
PG  - 617234
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vietnamese American women are at the greatest risk for cervical cancer
      but have the lowest cervical cancer screening rates. This study was to determine 
      whether demographic and acculturation, healthcare access, and knowledge and
      beliefs are associated with a prior history of cervical cancer screening among
      Vietnamese women. METHODS: Vietnamese women (n = 1450) from 30 Vietnamese
      community-based organizations located in Pennsylvania and New Jersey participated
      in the study and completed baseline assessments. Logistic regression analyses
      were performed. RESULTS: Overall levels of knowledge about cervical cancer
      screening and human papillomavirus (HPV) are low. Factors in knowledge, attitude,
      and beliefs domains were significantly associated with Pap test behavior. In
      multivariate analyses, physician recommendation for screening and having health
      insurance were positively associated with prior screening. CONCLUSION:
      Understanding the factors that are associated with cervical cancer screening will
      inform the development of culturally appropriate intervention strategies that
      would potentially lead to increasing cervical cancer screening rates among
      Vietnamese women.

TI  - Euthyroid goiter with and without nodules--diagnosis and treatment.
PG  - 506-15; quiz 516
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thyroid enlargement and thyroid nodules are common in the general
      population. This review concerns their proper diagnostic assessment and
      treatment. METHODS: We selectively reviewed the literature from 1990 to 2012 and 
      evaluated original articles and reviews retrieved from the PubMed database, as
      well as the recommendations of the following specialty societies: the German
      Societies of Endocrinology and Nuclear Medicine (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur
      Endokrinologie, Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Nuklearmedizin), the German Working
      Group for Endocrine Surgery (Chirurgische Arbeitsgemeinschaft Endokrinologie,
      CAEK), the European Thyroid Association, and the American Thyroid Association.
      RESULTS: There have been very few randomized trials concerning the diagnosis and 
      treatment of goiter. Nodular goiter can be managed by watchful waiting, drug
      treatment (initially with levothyroxine and iodide), radioactive iodine therapy, 
      or surgery. CONCLUSION: Many patients with nodules need no treatment at all.
      Treatment is indicated, however, if the patient is symptomatic and/or has an
      autonomously functioning ("hot") nodule, or if cancer is suspected. Potentially
      cancerous nodules must be operated on. If euthyroid nodular goiter is to be
      treated with the main goal of size reduction, either surgery or radioactive
      iodine therapy can be used. Drug treatment is an option for small nodules or
      goiters, but iatrogenic hyperthyroidism must be avoided at all costs. The type of
      follow-up that is required depends on the chosen treatment.

      cancer cell growth and migration.
PG  - 687
AB  - Microparticle and nanoparticle formulations are widely used to improve the
      bioavailability of low-solubility drugs and as vehicles for organ- and
      tissue-specific targeted drug delivery. We investigated the effect of a novel,
      controlled-release form of a bioactive lipid, cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA), on 
      human colon cancer cell line functions. We encapsulated cPA in gelatin-based
      hydrogels and examined its ability to inhibit the viability and migration of
      HT-29 and DLD-1 cells in vitro and the LPA-induced activity of the transcription 
      factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). The hydrogel
      delivery system prolonged cPA release into the culture medium. Accordingly,
      cPA-hydrogel microspheres substantially inhibited LPA-induced PPARgamma activity 
      and cell growth and migration compared with that of cells cultured with cPA
      alone. Thus, hydrogel microspheres are a potential system for stable and
      efficient delivery of bioactive lipids such as cPA and may offer a new strategy
      for targeted colon cancer treatment.

TI  - [Breast care nurse. A new specialist in the multidisciplinary care of breast
      cancer patients].
PG  - 152-7
AB  - The uniform European structure and professional standards for high quality breast
      cancer care were established in conjunction with the European Organisation for
      Research and Treatment, the European Society of Mastology and the European Breast
      Cancer Coalition with the support of the European Parliament. Well-prepared
      professional teams including a new member called the breast care nurse serve as
      ground for special breast cancer centers with international accreditation that
      provide modern, evidence based, patient centered multidisciplinary oncological
      care. The responsibilities of the new qualified professional staff member include
      the psycho-social support of the patient and carers from the moment of diagnosis 
      throughout the whole oncological treatment, the fostering of delivering
      information and communication between patients and specialists. As a result of
      the curriculum founded by the European Oncology Nursing Society, breast care
      nurses have become key members of the practice of holistic breast cancer care in 
      countries where the European recommendations have already been implemented.
      Considering the expected rearrangement of national oncological care, the new
      sub-specialty is outlined for the first time in the light of the experiences
      gained at the National Institute of Oncology, Budapest, a comprehensive cancer
      center.

AB  - Active oncotherapy, combination chemotherapy of lung cancer is accompanied with
      many side effects which may impair patients' quality of life and compromise the
      effectiveness of chemotherapy. Most side effects of chemotherapy are preventable 
      or treatable with optimal supportive care which enhances success in patient care 
      and treatment. The aim of this review is to summarize the most important
      conditions that may be associated with combined chemotherapy of lung cancer from 
      the practical point of view.

TI  - [Complete pathologic remission after preoperative high-dose brachytherapy in
      patients with operable cervical cancer: preliminary results of a prospective
      randomized study].
PG  - 171-7
AB  - The purpose of the study was a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of
      preoperative intracavitary high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR BT) in sterilization
      of the specimen of operable cervical cancer patients enrolled into a prospective,
      randomized study. Between 2005 and 2010, 100 operable cervical cancer patients of
      FIGO stage I/A2 (n=4), I/B1 (n=51), I/B2 (n=19), IIA (n=17), and proximal II/B
      (n=9) were randomized in two arms: in arm "A" (n=50) allocated treatment was 2x8 
      Gy preoperative intracavitary HDR BT followed by radical surgery, in arm "B" (n= 
      50) no preoperative treatment was given before the planned radical Wertheim
      hysterectomy. The rates of pathologic complete remission (pCR) were compared
      using the Fisher-exact test. In arm "A" 41 patients (82%), in arm "B" 42 patients
      (84%) underwent radical hysterectomy. The rate of pCR after preoperative BT was
      26.8% (11/41), while in the control group the specimen was free of tumor in 7.1% 
      (3/42; p=0.0204). Preoperative HDR BT for cervical cancer patients significantly 
      increases the rate of pathologically tumor-free specimens. Longer follow-up is
      needed to evaluate the impact of pCR on local tumor control and survival. Our
      preliminary results support further enrollment of patients into our randomized
      clinical trial.

TI  - [Role of MRI in determining the therapy of rectal cancer].
PG  - 179-86
AB  - Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in the management of
      rectal cancer. Advances in surgical technique and adjuvant therapies have led to 
      significant improvements in outcome for some patients. The advances in
      preoperative therapies have led to the need for an accurate preoperative staging 
      technique to select those patients who are expected to benefit from these
      interventions without subjecting others to unnecessary treatment. Performing
      neoadjuvant therapy knowledge of the relationship of the tumor to the
      circumferential resection margin is of importance. In Hungary, respecting
      European guidelines, the high resolution magnetic resonance imaging is mandatory 
      in the staging of rectal cancer, and in early rectal cancer transrectal
      endosonography has a complementary role. The current role of multidetector
      computer tomography is for detecting distant metastasis and in local tumor
      staging of advanced cancers.

TI  - [Smoking: a prognostic factor of lung cancer survival].
PG  - 187-91
AB  - Eighty % of lung cancer cases are attributable to smoking. There have been
      several publications concerning the prognostic factor role of smoking in lung
      cancer survival. Our research proposed four aims: 1) to gather more concise data 
      about the smoking habits of lung cancer patients; 2) to demonstrate the
      relationship between the quantitative indicator pack year index (PYI) of smoking 
      history and survival; 3) to test the hypothesis that smoking is not only a risk
      factor, but also a prognostic factor in lung cancer survival; and 4) to assess
      the survival advantage of smoking cessation at the time of diagnosis among lung
      cancer patients. We employed a questionnaire based prospective cohort design of
      lung cancer patients diagnosed in Budapest, 2009. We collected data on the method
      of cancer detection, cell types, stage, treatment, comorbidities and smoking
      habits at baseline. Follow-up questionnaires were completed to document changes
      (survival, smoking habits) every six months. Our sample included 929 patients
      (521 males and 408 females). The majority had a history of smoking (79%),
      including 68% current and 32% former smokers. The average PYI was 33. Fifty-seven
      % of current smokers quit at the time of lung cancer diagnosis (3% relapsed) and 
      43% continued smoking. The 30-month survival probabilities were found to be as
      follows: smokers who had PYI</=39: 44%; PYI>/=40: 35%. PYI </=39 vs. >/=40
      [HR=1.26, 95% CI 1.02 1.64; p=0.045]. The 30-month survival proved to be
      significantly better for those patients who quit at the time of diagnosis
      (quitters: 54% vs. continuous smokers: 42% [HR=1.29, 95% CI 1.12 1.78; p<0.001]).
      The benefit of quitting smoking was observed both in the surgically resected and 
      the not resected group. Our results demonstrate that smoking is not only a risk
      factor for lung cancer, but also a strong prognostic factor of survival at 30
      months after diagnosis. Survival is also significantly influenced by the smoking 
      history (PYI). It is markedly important for smoking patients to quit smoking at
      the time of diagnosis.

TI  - [Patient positioning using in-room kV CT for image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) of 
      prostate cancer].
PG  - 193-8
AB  - The purpose of the study was to evaluate accuracy of patients' set up verified by
      kV CT-on-rails system and compare automatic and manual image registration of
      planning and verification kVCT-s. Between January 2001 and March 2011, at ten
      patients with prostate cancer the clinical target volumes (CTVs) for prostate
      (CTV-PROS), and prostate plus caudal 1 cm of seminal vesicles (CTV-PVS) with or
      without pelvic lymph node region were contoured on the treatment planning CT,
      according to risk category of the patient. Planning target volumes (PTVs) were
      created with 1 cm margin extended around the CTVs in each direction. The
      isocentre was marked on the skin with three radiopaque markers. After the set up,
      treatment couch with the patient was turned by 180 degree and images were
      acquired of the region of the isocentre with a kV helical CT-on-rails system
      (treatment CT). An image registration software was used to co-register planning
      and treatment CT images. Automatic CT image co-registration was followed by
      manual co-registration taking into account the CTV-PROS contour and soft tissue
      informations. Deviations of the isocentres in lateral (LAT), longitudinal (LONG) 
      and vertical (VERT) directions were recorded after each image co-registration.
      Corresponding data were compared using the t-probe. Systematic (S) and random (s)
      errors of the set up were calculated. Adequate PTV to CTV margins were calculated
      by van Herk's formula (2.5xS + 0,7xs). Overall 252 deviations were analysed on
      fourty-two CT series of 10 patients. The mean errors of the set up with automatic
      and manual image co-registrations were 0.19 cm and 0.07 cm (p=0.001) in LAT, 0.05
      cm and 0.03 cm (p=0.07) in LONG and 0.16 cm and 0.22 cm (p=0.16) in VERT
      directions, respectively. The systematic errors of the set up for automatic and
      manual image registrations were 0.22 cm and 0.26 cm in LAT, 0.17 cm and 0.18 cm
      in LONG, 0.25 cm and 0.26 cm in VERT directions, respectively. The random errors 
      of the set up for automatic and manual image registrations were 0.31 cm and 0.26 
      cm in LAT, 0.27 cm and 0.27 cm in LONG and 0.24 cm and 0.33 cm in VERT
      directions, respectively. In case of manual image co-registration, the required
      PTV to CTV margins to cover at least 95% of the CTVs with at least 95% percent of
      the prescribed dose were calculated to 0.93 cm in LAT, 0.65 cm in LONG, and 0.89 
      cm in VERT directions. Patients set up can be verified with manual image
      co-registration based on soft tissues around the prostate using a kV CT-on-rails 
      system installed in the treatment room. The difference between automatic and
      manual image co-registration was significant in LAT direction. A PTV to CTV
      margin <1 cm seems to be appropriate to cover the CTVs in image-guided prostate
      radiotherapy. These findings support our recent clinical protocol.

TI  - [Nintedanib (BIBF 1120) in the treatment of solid cancers: an overview of
      biological and clinical aspects].
PG  - 199-208
AB  - Angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and metastasis. The main regulators of
      the process are the signaling cascades of VEGF-, PDGF- and FGF receptors.
      Inhibition of these pathways holds potential therapeutic benefit not only for
      cancer patients, but also for the treatment of other diseases. This paper
      summarizes the experimental and clinical results of studies available so far on
      the multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib (BIBF 1120). According to
      these studies, nintedanib effectively inhibits VEGFR-, PDGFR- and FGFR
      signalization and thus the proliferation and survival of cell types which highly 
      express these receptors (i.e. endothelial and smooth muscle cells and pericytes).
      In vitro studies and in vivo xenograft experiments have provided promising
      results. In the clinical setting, BIBF 1120 seems to be effective and well
      tolerated in various tumor types, such as lung, prostate, colorectal and
      hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as in gynecological tumors. The main adverse
      events are gastrointestinal toxicities and the reversible elevation of liver
      enzyme levels. Nintedanib might also be combined with paclitaxel, carboplatin,
      pemetrexed and docetaxel. There are several ongoing clinical trials testing the
      efficacy of BIBF 1120.

TI  - [Epidemiology and risk factors of the cervical squamous cell carcinoma].
PG  - 101-6
AB  - Neoplasm of the cervix, especially squamous cell cancer, is one of the most
      common malignancy of female genital organs. It etiology is complex; however,
      human papilloma virus (mostly HPV type 18, 16 and 45) infection seems to be the
      most important one. Other risk factors include: early sexual initiation, multiple
      pregnancies and labors, concomitant infections (Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria 
      gonorrhea, HSV2 - herpes simplex virus) of the genital tract, AIDS,
      immunosuppressive therapy, smoking and low socioeconomic status. The incidence of
      cervical cancer is particularly high in developing countries, while in countries 
      where government founding for the prevention and health education is high, the
      diseases is significantly less likely to occur. The incidence and mortality rate 
      of the cervical cancer can be substantially reduced by systematic screening
      cytological examinations. For such reason a liquid-based cytology is currently
      preferred. Implementation of HPV vaccines decrease the risk of infection, but
      effect on rate of the cervical cancer has to be confirmed in long-time
      prospective clinical and epidemiological studies.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the nutritional status of pediatric patients
      with hematological malignancies and solid tumors. DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 
      74 pediatric cancer patients were assessed for anthropometric status, biochemical
      profiles, and dietary intake. RESULTS: The prevalence of undernutrition was
      higher among patients with solid tumors as reflected in their lower dietary
      intakes of energy and nutrients compared with patients with hematological
      malignancies. PRACTICE IMPLICATION: Adequate dietary intake is important for
      pediatric cancer patients, but nurses need to pay more attention to the diets of 
      patients with solid tumors as compared with those with hematological
      malignancies.

TI  - Psychosocial oncofertility issues faced by adolescents and young adults over
      their lifetime: a review of the research.
PG  - 59-63
LID - 10.3109/14647273.2012.733480 [doi]
AB  - This review considers psychosocial oncofertility research relevant to adolescents
      and young adults over their lifetime. There is growing awareness of the fertility
      preservation needs of younger males including lowering practical barriers and
      attending to emotional impact. Despite decisional challenges facing females--the 
      experimental nature of procedures, time involved and potential involvement of
      partners/donors (for embryo cryopreservation)--findings suggest they too benefit 
      from fertility information at diagnosis and access to fertility specialists.
      Studies consistently report that fertility concerns affect well-being,
      relationships and life planning. Both genders thus want fertility issues to be
      raised proactively by professionals in the years following diagnosis: to help
      them make informed decisions at a time relevant to them, develop coping
      strategies for current and future related areas and to be referred to specialist 
      and/or therapeutic help if needed. Little is known about why cancer survivors are
      less likely to marry or have children, or about their parenthood experiences.

TI  - Approaches to Ras signaling modulation and treatment of Ras-dependent disorders: 
      a patent review (2007--present).
PG  - 1263-87
LID - 10.1517/13543776.2012.728586 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ras proteins are small GTPases molecular switches that cycle
      through two alternative conformational states, a GDP-bound inactive state and a
      GTP-bound active state. In the active state, Ras proteins interact with and
      modulate the activity of several downstream effectors regulating key cellular
      processes including proliferation, differentiation, survival, senescence,
      migration and metabolism. Activating mutations of RAS genes and of genes encoding
      Ras signaling members have a great incidence in proliferative disorders, such as 
      cancer, immune and inflammatory diseases and developmental syndromes. Therefore, 
      Ras and Ras signaling represent important clinical targets for the design and
      development of pharmaceutically active agents, including anticancer agents. AREAS
      COVERED: The authors summarize methods available to down-regulate the Ras pathway
      and review recent patents covering Ras signaling modulators, as well as methods
      designed to kill specifically cancer cells bearing activated RAS oncogene. EXPERT
      OPINION: Targeted therapy approach based on direct targeting of molecules
      specifically altered in Ras-dependent diseases is pursued with molecules that
      down-regulate expression or inhibit the biological function of mutant Ras or Ras 
      signaling members. The low success rate in a clinical setting of molecules
      targeting activated members of the Ras pathway may require development of novel
      approaches, including combined and synthetic lethal therapies.

TI  - Telomere length is shorter in affected members of families with familial
      nonmedullary thyroid cancer.
PG  - 301-7
LID - 10.1089/thy.2012.0270 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The theory that short telomere length and genetic defects in
      maintaining telomere length are associated with familial nonmedullary thyroid
      cancer (FNMTC) is controversial. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine
      whether telomere length and genes involved in maintaining telomere length are
      altered in FNMTC. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 44 members (13
      affected and 31 unaffected) of six families with FNMTC and from 60 controls.
      Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and reverse transcription PCR were
      performed to analyze relative telomere length (RTL), gene copy number, and mRNA
      expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), telomere repeat binding
      factor 1 (TRF1), telomere repeat binding factor 2 (TRF2), repressor activator
      protein 1 (RAP1), TRF1 interacting nuclear factor 2 (TIN2), tripeptidyl peptidase
      1 (TPP1), and protection of telomere 1 (POT1). RESULTS: Affected members had
      shorter RTL, as compared with unaffected members (0.98 vs. 1.23, p<0.01). There
      was no significant difference in hTERT, TRF1, TRF2, RAP1, TIN2, TPP1, and POT1
      gene copy number or mRNA expression between affected and unaffected members.
      CONCLUSIONS: RTL is shorter in affected members with FNMTC but is not associated 
      with altered copy number or expression in hTERT, TRF1, TRF2, RAP1, TIN2, TPP1,
      and POT1. The small differences in RTL preclude the utility of RTL as a marker
      for FNMTC in at-risk individuals.

AB  - The number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is functionally important and
      correlates with clinical outcome in several tumor entities. Herein we explore the
      impact of the density of T and B lymphocytes in prostate cancer tissue on
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence after prostatectomy in 3261 prostate
      cancer tissue samples. The number of prostate cancer-infiltrating CD3-positive T 
      cells and CD20-positive B cells per tissue spot in a tissue microarray format was
      determined by immunohistochemistry and was correlated with clinical and
      pathological data from the same patient cohort. Patients with very low and very
      high numbers of CD3-positive T cells per tissue spot had a significantly shorter 
      PSA recurrence-free survival compared to patients with intermediate numbers of T 
      cells (p = 0.0188). Furthermore, a high number of CD3-positive T cells per tissue
      spot was associated with fusion type prostate cancer identified by ERG expression
      analysis. The number of CD20-positive B cells per tissue spot was not associated 
      with other clinical and histopathological parameters. This study indicates that
      the density of T but not B cells plays a functional role in the biology of
      prostate cancer and may have an impact on clinical outcome in this frequent
      neoplasia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient navigation programs have been launched nationwide in an
      attempt to reduce racial/ethnic and socio-demographic disparities in cancer care,
      but few have evaluated outcomes in the prostate cancer setting. The National
      Cancer Institute-funded Chicago Patient Navigation Research Program (C-PNRP) aims
      to implement and evaluate the efficacy of a patient navigation intervention for
      predominantly low-income minority patients with an abnormal prostate cancer
      screening test at a Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital in Chicago. METHODS/DESIGN:
      From 2006 through 2010, C-PNRP implemented a quasi-experimental intervention
      whereby trained social worker and lay health navigators worked with veterans with
      an abnormal prostate screen to proactively identify and resolve personal and
      systems barriers to care. Men were enrolled at a VA urology clinic and were
      selected to receive navigated versus usual care based on clinic day. Patient
      navigators performed activities to facilitate timely follow-up such as
      appointment reminders, transportation coordination, cancer education, scheduling 
      assistance, and social support as needed. Primary outcome measures included time 
      (days) from abnormal screening to diagnosis and time from diagnosis to treatment 
      initiation. Secondary outcomes included psychosocial and demographic predictors
      of non-compliance and patient satisfaction. Dates of screening, follow-up visits,
      and treatment were obtained through chart audit, and questionnaires were
      administered at baseline, after diagnosis, and after treatment initiation. At the
      VA, 546 patients were enrolled in the study (245 in the navigated arm, 245 in the
      records-based control arm, and 56 in a subsample of surveyed control subjects).
      DISCUSSION: Given increasing concerns about balancing better health outcomes with
      lower costs, careful examination of interventions aimed at reducing healthcare
      disparities attain critical importance. While analysis of the C-PNRP data is
      underway, the design of this patient navigation intervention will inform other
      patient navigation programs addressing strategies to improve prostate cancer
      outcomes among vulnerable populations.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is a member of the
      activating transcription factor family. ATF4 expression is increased in response 
      to a diverse array of microenvironmental stresses including amino acid depletion,
      oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that are sensed by
      upstream eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) kinases. In 
      tumours, ATF4 expression is detected in hypoxic- and nutrient-deprived regions
      where it promotes metabolic homeostasis and cancer cell survival by
      transcriptionally regulating amino acid uptake and biosynthesis, autophagy, redox
      balance and angiogenesis. AREAS COVERED: The mechanism governing translational
      expression of ATF4 is discussed along with the physiological roles of ATF4 in
      growth and development. Conditions that result in ATF4 expression in tumours are 
      described with a focus on the role of ATF4 in cancer progression and treatment
      resistance. Several approaches to target ATF4 are presented including strategies 
      aimed at inhibiting transcriptional activity or increasing degradation,
      approaches to reduce ATF4 translation by inhibiting upstream eIF2alpha kinases
      and targeting of downstream pathways that are regulated by ATF4 including amino
      acid biosynthesis, ER-associated degradation and autophagy. EXPERT OPINION: The
      authors provide a number of suggestions that may assist in the development of
      ATF4 inhibitors.

TI  - Description and outcome of a cohort of 8 patients with WHIM syndrome from the
      French Severe Chronic Neutropenia Registry.
PG  - 71
LID - 10.1186/1750-1172-7-71 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: WHIM syndrome (WS), a rare congenital neutropenia due to mutations of
      the CXCR4 chemokine receptor, is associated with Human Papillomavirus
      (HPV)-induced Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, bacterial Infections and
      Myelokathexis. The long term follow up of eight patients highlights the clinical 
      heterogeneity of this disease as well as the main therapeutic approaches and
      remaining challenges in the light of the recent development of new CXCR4
      inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the natural history of WS
      based on a French cohort of 8 patients. METHODS: We have reviewed the clinical,
      biological and immunological features of patients with WS enrolled into the
      French Severe Chronic Neutropenia Registry. RESULTS: We identified four pedigrees
      with WS comprised of eight patients and one foetus. Estimated incidence for WS
      was of 0.23 per million births. Median age at the last visit was 29 years. Three 
      pedigrees encompassing seven patients and the fetus displayed autosomal dominant 
      heterozygous mutations of the CXCR4 gene, while one patient presented a wild-type
      CXCR4 gene. Two subjects exhibited congenital conotruncal heart malformations. In
      addition to neutropenia and myelokathexis, all patients presented deep
      monocytopenia and lymphopenia. Seven patients presented repeated bacterial Ears
      Nose Throat as well as severe bacterial infections that were curable with
      antibiotics. Four patients with late onset prophylaxis developed chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Two patients reported atypical mycobacteria
      infections which in one case may have been responsible for one patient's death
      due to liver failure at the age of 40.6 years. HPV-related disease manifested in 
      five subjects and progressed as invasive vulvar carcinoma with a fatal course in 
      one patient at the age of 39.5 years. In addition, two patients developed T cell 
      lymphoma skin cancer and basal cell carcinoma at the age of 38 and 65 years.
      CONCLUSIONS: Continuous prophylactic anti-infective measures, when started in
      early childhood, seem to effectively prevent further bacterial infections and the
      consequent development of COPD. Long-term follow up is needed to evaluate the
      effect of early anti-HPV targeted prophylaxis on the development of skin and
      genital warts.

AB  - Supramolecular microcapsules (SMCs) with the drug-loaded wall layers for
      pH-controlled drug delivery were designed and prepared. By using layer-by-layer
      (LbL) technique, the SMCs were constructed based on the self-assembly between
      polyaldenhyde dextran-graft-adamantane (PAD-g-AD) and carboxymethyl
      dextran-graft-beta-CD (CMD-g-beta-CD) on CaCO(3) particles via host-guest
      interaction. Simultaneously, adamantine-modified doxorubicin (AD-Dox) was also
      loaded on the LbL wall via host-guest interaction. The in vitro drug release
      study was carried out at different pHs. Because the AD groups were linked with
      PAD (PAD-g-AD) or Dox (AD-Dox) by pH-cleavable hydrazone bonds, AD moieties can
      be removed under the weak acidic condition, leading to destruction of SMCs and
      release of Dox. The pH-controlled drug release can enhance the uptake by tumor
      cells and thus achieve improved cancer therapy efficiency.

TI  - DNA Methylation status of Wnt antagonist SFRP5 can predict the response to the
      EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in non-small cell lung cancer.
PG  - 80
LID - 10.1186/1756-9966-31-80 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well known that genetic alternation of epidermal growth factor 
      receptor (EGFR) plays critical roles in tumorgenesis of lung cancer and can
      predict outcome of non-small-cell lung cancer treatment, especially the EGFR
      tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) therapy. However, it is unclear whether
      epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation involve in the response to the
      EGFR-TKI therapy. METHODS: Tumor samples from 155 patients with stages IIIB to IV
      NSCLC who received EGFR-TKI therapy were analyzed for DNA methylation status of
      Wnt antagonist genes, including SFRP1, SFRP2, SFRP5, DKK3, WIF1, and APC, using
      methylation specific PCR (MSP) method. EGFR mutations detections were performed
      in the same tissues samples using Denaturing High Performance Liquid
      Chromatography (DHPLC). RESULTS: We found that Wnt antagonists tend to methylate 
      simultaneously. Methylation of sFRP1 and sFRP5 are reversely correlated with EGFR
      mutation (P = 0.005, P = 0.011). However, no correlations of methylations of
      other Wnt antagonist genes with EGFR mutation were found. The patients with
      methylated SFRP5 have a significant shorter progression free survival than those 
      with unmethylated SFRP5 in response to EGFR-TKI treatment (P = 0.002), which is
      independent of EGFR genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with unmethylated SFRP5 are
      more likely to benefit from EGFR-TKI therapy.

AB  - The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease in Korea has been believed to
      be low, but the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease in Korea is expected
      to increase because of the longer life expectancy and more ingestion of
      westernized food. The aim of this study was to report differences in the risk
      factors of reflux esophagitis (RE) according to age in Korea. We prospectively
      recruited the subjects who had RE among those who visited a health promotion
      center for upper gastrointestinal cancer surveillance at Hallym Medical Center
      (five institutions) between January 2008 and February 2009. The enrolled study
      participants comprised 742 subjects with RE and 1484 healthy controls. The
      independent risk factors of RE in young and adult group were male sex, smoking,
      coffee, body mass index >/= 25, hiatal hernia, and Helicobacter pylori
      negativity. The risk factors of RE in elderly group were smoking, coffee, and
      hiatal hernia. The risk factors for RE according to age group were found to
      differ. In elderly group, Helicobacter pylori infection was not a significant
      protective factor contrary to young and adult groups.

TI  - The connecticut experiment: the role of ultrasound in the screening of women with
      dense breasts.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the potential of screening breast
      ultrasound to improve breast cancer detection in women with mammographically
      normal, but dense breasts. Six Connecticut radiology practices with 12 total
      sites participated in a retrospective chart review. The total number of screening
      mammograms, screening ultrasounds broken down by BIRADS (Breast Imaging Reporting
      and Data System) codes, and the number of positive and negative biopsies were
      collected from November 2009 through November 2010. Demographic data on the
      patients with positive biopsies as well as cancer staging were also collected.
      Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value, and Negative Predictive
      Value were calculated. A total of 72,030 screening mammograms and 8,647 screening
      ultrasounds were performed at the research sites during the study period.
      Relevant research indicates that 41% of the female population has dense breasts. 
      In this study, 12% (8,647/72,030) underwent follow-up breast ultrasound
      screening. A total of 86% (7,451/8,647) of the ultrasounds were BIRADS 1 or 2, 9%
      (767/8,647) were BIRADS 3, 5% (429/8,647) were BIRADS 4 or 5. Of those 429
      recommended to undergo biopsy 418 were performed and 28 cancers were found. There
      was one false negative. Screening breast ultrasound in women with
      mammographically normal, but dense breasts has a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) 
      of 6.7% (28/418), Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 99.9% (7,450/7,451),
      sensitivity of 96.6% (28/29), and a specificity of 94.9% (7,450/7,851). Screening
      ultrasound had an additional yield of 3.25 per 1,000 cancers in women with dense 
      breasts and normal mammograms and no additional risk factors. As with all
      screening tests, time, cost, and false positive risk must be considered.

TI  - Lymphatic mapping with fluorescence navigation using indocyanine green and
      axillary surgery in patients with primary breast cancer.
PG  - 535-41
LID - 10.1111/tbj.12004 [doi]
AB  - The indocyanine green fluorescence (ICGf) navigation method provides real-time
      lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node (SLN) visualization, which enables the 
      removal of SLNs and their associated lymphatic networks. In this study, we
      investigated the features of the drainage pathways detected with the ICGf
      navigation system and the order of metastasis in axillary nodes. From April 2008 
      to February 2010, 145 patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer
      underwent SLN surgery with ICGf navigation. The video-recorded data from 79
      patients were used for lymphatic mapping analysis. We analyzed 145 patients with 
      clinically node-negative breast cancer who underwent SLN surgery with the ICGf
      navigation system. Fluorescence-positive SLNs were identified in 144 (99%) of 145
      patients. Both single and multiple routes to the axilla were identified in 47% of
      cases using video-recorded lymphatic mapping data. An internal mammary route was 
      detected in 6% of the cases. Skip metastasis to the second or third SLNs was
      observed in 6 of the 28 node-positive patients. We also examined the strategy of 
      axillary surgery using the ICGf navigation system. We found that, based on the
      features of nodal involvement, 4-node resection could provide precise information
      on the nodal status. The ICGf navigation system may provide a different lymphatic
      mapping result than computed tomography lymphography in clinically node-negative 
      breast cancer patients. Furthermore, it enables the identification of lymph nodes
      that do not accumulate indocyanine green or dye adjacent to the SLNs in the
      sequence of drainage. Knowledge of the order of nodal metastasis as revealed by
      the ICGf system may help to personalize the surgical treatment of axilla in
      SLN-positive cases, although additional studies are required.

TI  - A case of metachronous double primary neuroendocrine cancer in pancreas/ileum and

AB  - We describe an unusual case of a 50-year-old female patient developing two
      primary cancers with neuroendocrine features. Initially the patient underwent
      surgery for an entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma. During the subsequent 
      follow-up she experienced some episodes of vaginal bleeding with negative PET
      scanning with the tracer fluorine-18 (F-18) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). A
      Papanicolaou (pap) smear and an endometrial biopsy revealed a primary
      neuroendocrine cancer of the uterine cervix. The present case underlines the
      importance of clinical follow-up after a diagnosis of intestinal neuroendocrine
      tumor, investigating any new symptom. Female patients, after the diagnosis of
      entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma, must be recommended to continue
      screening pap test examinations for the likelihood of classical squamous and
      glandular cervical cancers and also for neuroendocrine cervical cancer.

TI  - Obesity and prostate cancer: gene expression signature of human periprostatic
      adipose tissue.
PG  - 108
LID - 10.1186/1741-7015-10-108 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periprostatic (PP) adipose tissue surrounds the prostate, an organ
      with a high predisposition to become malignant. Frequently, growing prostatic
      tumor cells extend beyond the prostatic organ towards this fat depot. This study 
      aimed to determine the genome-wide expression of genes in PP adipose tissue in
      obesity/overweight (OB/OW) and prostate cancer patients. METHODS: Differentially 
      expressed genes in human PP adipose tissue were identified using microarrays.
      Analyses were conducted according to the donors' body mass index characteristics 
      (OB/OW versus lean) and prostate disease (extra prostatic cancer versus organ
      confined prostate cancer versus benign prostatic hyperplasia). Selected genes
      with altered expression were validated by real-time PCR. Ingenuity Pathway
      Analysis (IPA) was used to investigate gene ontology, canonical pathways and
      functional networks. RESULTS: In the PP adipose tissue of OB/OW subjects, we
      found altered expression of genes encoding molecules involved in
      adipogenic/anti-lipolytic, proliferative/anti-apoptotic, and mild
      immunoinflammatory processes (for example, FADS1, down-regulated, and LEP and
      ANGPT1, both up-regulated). Conversely, in the PP adipose tissue of subjects with
      prostate cancer, altered genes were related to adipose tissue cellular activity
      (increased cell proliferation/differentiation, cell cycle activation and
      anti-apoptosis), whereas a downward impact on immunity and inflammation was also 
      observed, mostly related to the complement (down-regulation of CFH).
      Interestingly, we found that the microRNA MIRLET7A2 was overexpressed in the PP
      adipose tissue of prostate cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity and excess
      adiposity modified the expression of PP adipose tissue genes to ultimately foster
      fat mass growth. In patients with prostate cancer the expression profile of PP
      adipose tissue accounted for hypercellularity and reduced immunosurveillance.
      Both findings may be liable to promote a favorable environment for prostate
      cancer progression.

TI  - Outpatient-shopping behavior and survival rates in newly diagnosed cancer
      patients.
PG  - 488-96
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the appropriateness of the definition of
      outpatient-shopping behavior in Taiwanese patients. STUDY DESIGN: Linked study of
      3 databases (Taiwan Cancer Registry, National Health Insurance [NHI] claim
      database, and death registry database). METHODS: Outpatient shopping behavior was
      defined as making at least 4 or 5 physician visits to confirm a cancer diagnosis.
      We analyzed patient-related factors and the 5-year overall survival rate of the
      outpatient-shopping group compared with a nonshopping group. Using the household 
      registration database and NHI database, we determined the proportion of
      outpatient shopping, characteristics of patients who did and did not shop for
      outpatient therapy, time between diagnosis and start of regular treatment, and
      medical service utilization in the shopping versus the nonshopping group.
      RESULTS: Patients with higher incomes were significantly more likely to shop for 
      outpatient care. Patients with higher comorbidity scores were 1.4 times more
      likely to shop for outpatient care than patients with lower scores. Patients
      diagnosed with more advanced cancer were more likely to shop than those who were 
      not. Patients might be more trusting of cancer diagnoses given at higher-level
      hospitals. The nonshopping groups had a longer duration of survival over 5 years.
      CONCLUSIONS: Health authorities should consider charging additional fees after a 
      specific outpatient- shopping threshold is reached to reduce this behavior. The
      government may need to reassess the function of the medical sources network by
      shrinking it from the original 4 levels to 2 levels, or by enhancing the referral
      function among different hospital levels.

TI  - State-level projections of cancer-related medical care costs: 2010 to 2020.
PG  - 525-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: As the population ages, the financial amount spent on cancer care is 
      expected to increase substantially. In this study, we projected cancer-related
      medical costs by state from 2010 through 2020. METHODS: We used pooled Medical
      Expenditure Panel Survey data for 2004 to 2008 and US Census Bureau population
      projections to produce state-level estimates of the number of people treated for 
      cancer and the average cost of their treatment, from a health system perspective,
      by age group (18-44, 45-64, >65 years) and sex. In the base model, we assumed
      that the percentage of people in each of the 6 age-by-sex categories who had been
      treated for cancer would remain constant and that the inflation-adjusted average 
      cancer treatment cost per person would increase at the same rate as Congressional
      Budget Office projections of overall medical spending. RESULTS: We projected that
      state-level cancer-related medical costs would increase by 34% to 115% (median = 
      72%) and that state-level costs in 2020 would range from $347 million to $28.3
      billion in 2010 dollars (median = $3.7 billion). CONCLUSIONS: The number of
      people treated for cancer and the costs of their cancer-related medical care are 
      projected to increase substantially for each state. Effective prevention and
      early detection strategies are needed to limit the growing burden of cancer.

TI  - Breast cancer recurrence after inadvertent malpositioning of a partial breast
      radiation catheter.
PG  - 591-5
LID - 10.1111/tbj.12012 [doi]
AB  - Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is an alternative to receiving
      whole breast radiation in carefully selected patients. Because breast cancer
      local recurrence rates are low and follow-up has been short-term, the exact cause
      of recurrences after APBI has been difficult to evaluate. We report the first
      case of documented radiation balloon catheter malpositioning that resulted in
      local recurrence. Patients undergo CT imaging of the breast after radiation
      balloon catheter placement for radiotherapy treatment planning, which evaluates
      adequate conformance of the balloon to the surrounding breast parenchyma and
      confirms a >7 mm distance between the balloon surface and the skin surface.
      Although true local recurrences are rare in appropriately selected partial breast
      irradiation candidates, inadvertent malpositioning of the radiation treatment
      catheter can increase the risk. This case is presented to illustrate the
      importance of comparing CT radiation planning images, with treatment catheter in 
      place, to the original diagnostic breast imaging studies to confirm proper
      catheter positioning (in addition to measuring balloon to skin distance and
      conformance) prior to initiating radiotherapy.

      treatment and prevention.
PG  - 109
LID - 10.1186/1741-7015-10-109 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies demonstrated that obesity is associated with prostate cancer
      aggressiveness and prognosis. However, the mechanisms underlying this
      relationship are poorly understood. Tumor microenvironment has been increasingly 
      considered as an important determinant of cancer growth and progression. In the
      light of this growing evidence, Ribeiro et al., in a BMC Medicine research
      article, investigated the gene expression profiles of periprostatic adipose
      tissue of obese patients with and without prostate cancer and compared them to
      those of lean patients. Their findings provide the first evidence of a
      differential gene expression in the periprostatic adipose tissue of obese
      individuals. Differences were also observed when comparing the periprostatic
      adipose tissue of patients with and without prostate cancer. Differentially
      expressed genes are related to cell proliferation and immunological responses.
      Besides suggesting the genetic bases for the observed relationship between
      obesity and prostate cancer aggressiveness, these findings provide new insights
      on the important link between local microenvironment and cancer progression.

TI  - EGFR/Src/Akt signaling modulates Sox2 expression and self-renewal of stem-like
      side-population cells in non-small cell lung cancer.
PG  - 73
LID - 10.1186/1476-4598-11-73 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer stem cells are thought to be responsible for the initiation
      and progression of cancers. In non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), Hoechst
      33342 dye effluxing side population (SP) cells are shown to have stem cell like
      properties. The oncogenic capacity of cancer stem-like cells is in part due to
      their ability to self-renew; however the mechanistic correlation between
      oncogenic pathways and self-renewal of cancer stem-like cells has remained
      elusive. Here we characterized the SP cells at the molecular level and evaluated 
      its ability to generate tumors at the orthotopic site in the lung
      microenvironment. Further, we investigated if the self-renewal of SP cells is
      dependent on EGFR mediated signaling. RESULTS: SP cells were detected and
      isolated from multiple NSCLC cell lines (H1650, H1975, A549), as well as primary 
      human tumor explants grown in nude mice. SP cells demonstrated stem-like
      properties including ability to self-renew and grow as spheres; they were able to
      generate primary and metastatic tumors upon orthotopic implantation into the lung
      of SCID mice. In vitro study revealed elevated expression of stem cell associated
      markers like Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog as well as demonstrated intrinsic epithelial to
      mesenchymal transition features in SP cells. Further, we show that abrogation of 
      EGFR, Src and Akt signaling through pharmacological or genetic inhibitors
      suppresses the self-renewal growth and expansion of SP-cells and resulted in
      specific downregulation of Sox2 protein expression. siRNA mediated depletion of
      Sox2 significantly blocked the SP phenotype as well as its self-renewal capacity;
      whereas other transcription factors like Oct4 and Nanog played a relatively
      lesser role in regulating self-renewal. Interestingly, Sox2 was elevated in
      metastatic foci of human NSCLC samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that
      Sox2 is a novel target of EGFR-Src-Akt signaling in NSCLCs that modulates
      self-renewal and expansion of stem-like cells from NSCLC. Therefore, the outcome 
      of the EGFR-Src-Akt targeted therapy may rely upon the expression and function of
      Sox2 within the NSCLC-CSCs.

AB  - Understanding the biological features of cancer is the basis for designing
      efficient anti-cancer nanomedicines. On one hand, important therapeutic targets
      for anti-cancer nanomedicines need to be identified based on cancer biology, to
      address the unmet medical needs. On the other hand, the unique pathophysiological
      properties of cancer affect the delivery and interactions of anti-cancer
      nanomedicines with their therapeutic targets. This review discusses several
      critical cancer biological properties that challenge the currently available
      anti-cancer treatments, including cancer heterogeneity and cancer stem cells, the
      complexcity of tumor microenvironment, and the inevitable cancer metastases. In
      addition, the biological bases of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)
      effect and tumor-specific active targeting, as well as the physiological barriers
      for passive and active targeting of anti-cancer nanomedicines are covered in this
      review. Correspondingly, possible nanomedicine strategies to target cancer
      heterogeneity, cancer stem cells and metastases, to overcome the challenges
      related to tumor passive targeting and tumor penetration, and to improve the
      interactions of therapeutic payloads with the therapeutic targets are discussed. 
      The focus is mainly on the designs of polymeric anti-cancer nanomedicines.

TI  - beta-catenin and K-ras mutations and RASSF1A promoter methylation in Taiwanese
      colorectal cancer patients.
PG  - 1277-81
LID - 10.1089/gtmb.2012.0126 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this study was to investigate the associations of
      beta-catenin mutations, K-ras mutations, methylations of the RASSF1A promoter,
      and the survival of Taiwanese colorectal cancer (CRC) subjects who received
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU) adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: The complete coding region 
      of the K-ras gene and exon 3 and exon 4 of the beta-catenin gene isolated from
      tumor tissues and adjacent normal colon tissues from 117 CRC subjects were
      sequenced, respectively. Methylations in the RASSF1A promoter region were also
      investigated. Various characteristics of the 117 subjects were recorded and used 
      in the Cox proportional-hazard model analyses. Three missense mutations, one
      nonsense mutation, and one deletion were identified in the beta-catenin gene. A 2
      bp deletion was identified in the K-ras gene. We found that the frequencies of
      mutations in the beta-catenin and K-ras genes were less pronounced in Taiwanese
      CRC subjects as compared with other populations. Methylations in the RASSF1A
      promoter region were detected in 73.5% (n=86/117) of the subjects, which was
      higher than in other studies. Methylations in the RASSF1A promoter have no
      significant effect on hazards for all CRC deaths caused in Taiwanese CRC
      patients. No interaction between 5-FU adjuvant chemotherapy and methylations of
      the RASSF1A promoter was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The mutation frequencies of
      beta-catenin and K-ras genes in Taiwanese CRC patients are very low, which may
      suggest that they are not the dominant factors for CRC occurrence and prognosis
      in Taiwanese CRC patients. Methylation of RASSF1A promoter is independent of the 
      prognosis for Taiwanese CRC patients. Taiwanese subjects differ from subjects of 
      other populations with regard to beta-catenin, K-ras, and RASSF1A presentations
      for CRC.

TI  - Capture and dimethyl labeling of glycopeptides on hydrazide beads for
      quantitative glycoproteomics analysis.
PG  - 8452-6
LID - 10.1021/ac302130r [doi]
AB  - Incorporation of isotopic tag onto peptides via chemical labeling is a popular
      approach for quantitative proteomics. Chemical labeling via solution based
      methods usually lead to a tedious process and sample loss because several sample 
      preparation steps including buffer exchange and desalting are performed. In this 
      study, a solid phase based labeling approach by integration of glycopeptide
      enrichment and stable isotope labeling on hydrazide beads was developed for
      relative quantification of protein glycosylation, by which enrichment, washing,
      labeling, and release of the glycopeptides were all performed on the hydrazide
      beads sequentially. This approach was proved to be accurate in quantitative
      glycoproteome analysis and have good linearity range with 2 orders of magnitude
      for quantification of glycopeptides. Compared with dimethyl labeling
      conventionally performed in solution, the developed approach has better
      enrichment recovery (10-330% improvement) and high detection sensitivity in which
      42% of annotated glycosites (vs 26%) still can be quantified using only 10 mug of
      four standard glycoprotein mixtures and 400 mug of bovine serum album
      interference as starting sample. The applicability of the approach for
      quantitative glycopeptide profiling was also explored by differential analysis of
      glycoproteome between human normal serum and liver cancer serum.

TI  - The bioinformatics analysis of miRNAs signatures differentially expressed in
      HER2(+) versus HER2(-) breast cancers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the signatures of miRNAs differentially expressed in
      HER2(+) versus HER2(-) breast cancers that accurately predict the HER2 status of 
      breast cancer, and to provide further insight into breast cancer therapy.
      METHODS: By the methods of literature search, aberrant expressed miRNAs were
      collected. By target prediction algorithm of TargetScan and PicTar and the data
      enrichment analysis, target gene sets of miRNAs differentially expressed in
      HER2(+) versus HER2(-) breast cancers were built. Then, using the Database for
      Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) database, the
      function modules of Gene Ontology categories and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
      Genomes (KEGG) and BIOCARTA pathway, biological functions and signaling pathways 
      that are probably regulated by miRNAs, were analyzed. RESULTS: We got five sets
      of miRNAs expressed in different HER2 status of breast cancers finally. The five 
      sets of data contain 22; 32; 3; 38; and 62 miRNAs, respectively. After miRNAs
      target prediction and data enrichment, 5,734; 22,409; 1,142; 22,293; and 43,460
      target genes of five miRNA sets were collected. Gene ontology analysis found
      these genes may be involved in transcription, protein transport, angiogenesis,
      and apoptosis. Moreover, certain KEGG and BIOCARTA signaling pathways related
      toHER2 status were found. CONCLUSION: Using TargetScan and PicTar for data
      enrichment, and DAVID database, Gene Ontology categories, KEGG and BIOCARTA
      pathway for analysis of miRNAs different expression, we conducted a new method
      for biological interpretation of miRNA profiling data in HER2(+) versus HER2(-)
      breast cancers. It may improve understanding the regulatory roles of miRNAs in
      different molecular subtypes of breast cancers. Therefore, it is beneficial to
      improve the accuracy of experimental efforts to breast cancer and potential
      therapeutic targets.

TI  - In search of the cancer candidate: can lay epidemiology help?
PG  - 575-91
LID - 10.1111/j.1467-9566.2012.01513.x [doi]
AB  - First published in 1991, the ideas embedded in 'Lay epidemiology and the
      prevention paradox' offered a novel and rational explanation for the lay public's
      failure to fully engage with the lifestyle messages offered by health educators. 
      During the course of a large ethnographic study in South Wales, Davison and
      colleagues described the emergence of what they termed the coronary candidate.
      Candidacy provides a 'cultural mechanism' that facilitates the estimation of risk
      for coronary heart disease. The model has rarely been applied to other major
      illnesses. This article presents findings from a study that sought to explore the
      lay epidemiology model, candidacy and cancer. In a series of in-depth individual 
      interviews, members of the lay public discussed their ideas about cancer, and
      what emerged was an explanatory hierarchy to account for cancer events. Yet the
      random and unpredictable nature of cancer was emphasised as well as a general
      reluctance to accept the idea of cancer candidacy.

PG  - 198
LID - 10.1186/1477-7819-10-198 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The etiopathogenesis of gallbladder cancer is still unknown. Both
      environmental and patient factors have been incriminated in its cause. That it is
      found in pockets of epidemiological distribution raises an issue of genetic
      changes associated with it. The aim of this study was to find out the chromosomal
      changes in gallbladder cancer. METHODS: Lymphocyte cell culture was carried out
      on blood of gallbladder cancer patients to determine chromosomal banding
      abnormalities. Native PAGE was also evaluated to analyze lactate dehydrogenase
      (LDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase enzyme activity from the same
      blood of gallbladder cancer patients. RESULTS: Out of 30 gallbladder cancer
      patients, 4 male showed breakage on the long arm of chromosome 1 while only one
      male patient showed the translocation from the long arm of chromosome 4 to the
      long arm of chromosome 6 in a male patient. CONCLUSION: The aberrations found in 
      our study may suggest underlying genetic predisposition for the development of
      gallbladder cancer. They can act as a marker for gallbladder cancer, which needs 
      further study.

TI  - Evasion of tumours from the control of the immune system: consequences of brief
      encounters.
PG  - 31
LID - 10.1186/1745-6150-7-31 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this work a mathematical model describing the growth of a solid
      tumour in the presence of an immune system response is presented. Specifically,
      attention is focused on the interactions between cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs)
      and tumour cells in a small, avascular multicellular tumour. At this stage of the
      disease the CTLs and the tumour cells are considered to be in a state of dynamic 
      equilibrium or cancer dormancy. The precise biochemical and cellular mechanisms
      by which CTLs can control a cancer and keep it in a dormant state are still not
      completely understood from a biological and immunological point of view. The
      mathematical model focuses on the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour cells,
      immune cells, chemokines and "chemorepellents" in an immunogenic tumour. The CTLs
      and tumour cells are assumed to migrate and interact with each other in such a
      way that lymphocyte-tumour cell complexes are formed. These complexes result in
      either the death of the tumour cells (the normal situation) or the inactivation
      of the lymphocytes and consequently the survival of the tumour cells. In the
      latter case, we assume that each tumour cell that survives its "brief encounter" 
      with the CTLs undergoes certain beneficial phenotypic changes. RESULTS: We
      explore the dynamics of the model under these assumptions and show that the
      process of immuno-evasion can arise as a consequence of these encounters. We show
      that the proposed mechanism not only shape the dynamics of the total number of
      tumor cells and of CTLs, but also the dynamics of their spatial distribution. We 
      also briefly discuss the evolutionary features of our model, by framing them in
      the recent quasi-Lamarckian theories. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings might have some
      interesting implication of interest for clinical practice. Indeed, immuno-editing
      process can be seen as an "involuntary" antagonistic process acting against
      immunotherapies, which aim at maintaining a tumor in a dormant state, or at
      suppressing it.

TI  - Stress associated gene expression in blood cells is related to outcome in
      radiotherapy treated head and neck cancer patients.
PG  - 426
LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-12-426 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously observed that a radiotherapy-induced biochemical
      response in plasma was associated with favourable outcome in head and neck
      squamous carcinoma cancer (HNSCC) patients. The aim of the present study was to
      compare stress associated blood cell gene expression between two sub-groups of
      HNSCC patients with different biochemical responses to radiotherapy. METHODS: Out
      of 87 patients (histologically verified), 10 biochemical 'responders' having a
      high relative increase in plasma oxidative damage and a concomitant decrease in
      plasma antioxidants during radiotherapy and 10 'poor-responders' were selected
      for gene-expression analysis and compared using gene set enrichment analysis.
      RESULTS: There was a significant induction of stress-relevant gene-sets in the
      responders following radiotherapy compared to the poor-responders. The relevance 
      of the involvement of similar stress associated gene expression for HNSCC cancer 
      and radioresistance was verified using two publicly available data sets of 42
      HNSCC cases and 14 controls (GEO GSE6791), and radiation resistant and radiation 
      sensitive HNSCC xenografts (E-GEOD-9716). CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy induces a
      systemic stress response, as revealed by induction of stress relevant gene
      expression in blood cells, which is associated to favourable outcome in a cohort 
      of 87 HNSCC patients. Whether these changes in gene expression reflects a
      systemic effect or are biomarkers of the tumour micro-environmental status needs 
      further study. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Raw data are available at ArrayExpress under
      accession number E-MEXP-2460.

TI  - Sorafenib in advanced iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer: efficacy, 
      safety and exploratory analysis of role of serum thyroglobulin and FDG-PET.
PG  - 760-7
LID - 10.1111/cen.12057 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Radioactive iodine is a crucial tool for treatment of differentiated
      thyroid cancer (DTC). In 5% of cases, DTCs lose I-131 avidity and assume an
      aggressive behaviour. Treatment options for iodine-refractory DTC are limited. We
      report the experience of off-label use of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib
      for treatment of advanced iodine-refractory DTC. DESIGN: Patients with
      progressive DTC refractory to radioactive iodine were treated with sorafenib used
      off-label independently from their performance status. Primary study end-points
      were radiological response, progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. Secondary
      end-points were site-specific radiological response and overall survival (OS). An
      exploratory analysis of the role of serum thyroglobulin (Tg) and
      fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) was performed.
      RESULTS: A total of 17 patients were included in the study. Median follow-up was 
      15.5 months. Clinical benefit was obtained in 71% of subjects (30% partial
      response and 41% stable disease). Sorafenib was mostly well tolerated, but a high
      incidence of fatal events was reported (three patients died from severe bleeding 
      events and two from cardiac arrest). Median PFS was 9 months. Median OS was 10
      months. The best responses were observed in lymph nodes and lung. Baseline Tg
      levels and the Tg response to treatment were correlated to both radiological
      response and PFS. Baseline FDG-PET assessment and early FDG-PET response were
      correlated to radiological response. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib allows morphological 
      disease control in the majority of patients with iodine-refractory DTC.
      Progression-free survival and overall survival were lower than in previous
      studies as a consequence of the worse clinical condition of our patients.
      Sorafenib is mostly well tolerated but could have been responsible for the
      reported fatal events. Baseline Tg and the Tg response to treatment could be
      useful for predicting morphological response and clinical outcome. Early FDG-PET 
      response could be helpful for the timely identification of nonresponding
      patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: This phase II trial aimed to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of a
      first-line combination of targeted therapies for advanced non-squamous NSCLC:
      bevacizumab (B) and erlotinib (E), followed by platinum-based CT at disease
      progression (PD). METHODS: 103 patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC were
      treated with B (15 mg/kg day 1 of each 21-day cycle) and E (150 mg daily) until
      PD or unacceptable toxicity. Upon PD patients received 6 cycles of CT
      (cisplatin/carboplatin and gemcitabine). The primary endpoint was disease
      stabilization rate (DSR) after 12 weeks of BE treatment. RESULTS: 101 patients
      were evaluable. Under BE, DSR at week 12 was 54.5%. 73 patients had at least
      stable disease (SD), including 1 complete remission and 17 partial responses
      (PR). No unexpected toxicities were observed. Median time to progression (TTP)
      under BE was 4.1 months. 62 patients started CT; 35 received at least 4 cycles (6
      PR, 32 SD). At a median follow-up of 36 months, median overall survival (OS) was 
      14.1 months. CONCLUSIONS: First-line BE treatment followed by a fixed CT regimen 
      at PD is feasible with acceptable toxicity and activity. In a non-squamous NSCLC 
      population unselected for EGFR status, we found OS rates similar to standard CT.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To test whether (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron
      emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging metrics correlate with
      outcomes in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with
      stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-four
      patients with stage I NSCLC underwent pre-SABR PET at simulation and/or post-SABR
      PET within 6 months. We analyzed maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) and
      metabolic tumor volume defined using several thresholds (MTV50%, or MTV2, 4, 7,
      and 10). Endpoints included primary tumor control (PTC), progression-free
      survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). We
      performed Kaplan-Meier, competing risk, and Cox proportional hazards survival
      analyses. RESULTS: Patients received 25-60 Gy in 1 to 5 fractions. Median
      follow-up time was 13.2 months. The 1-year estimated PTC, PFS, OS and CSS were
      100, 83, 87 and 94%, respectively. Pre-treatment SUV(max) (p=0.014), MTV(7)
      (p=0.0077), and MTV(10) (p=0.0039) correlated significantly with OS. In the
      low-MTV(7)vs. high-MTV(7) sub-groups, 1-year estimated OS was 100 vs. 78%
      (p=0.0077) and CSS was 100 vs. 88% (p=0.082). CONCLUSIONS: In this
      hypothesis-generating study we identified multiple pre-treatment PET-CT metrics
      as potential predictors of OS and CSS in patients with NSCLC treated with SABR.
      These could aid risk-stratification and treatment individualization if validated 
      prospectively.

TI  - Tumor size as measured at initial X-ray examination, not length of bile duct

AB  - BACKGROUND: The survival of unresectable pancreatic cancer patients is extremely 
      poor. The aim of this study was to examine if tumor size could predict survival
      length in order to optimize patient care. METHODS: A retrospective observational 
      study was performed on 185 consecutive patients with unresectable pancreatic
      cancer (ICD10: C250-2 and C258) who were diagnosed from 2003 to May 2010. The
      patients' initial radiographs at presentation of symptoms were reviewed by the
      same radiologist, and tumor extent was determined. RESULTS: The largest tumor
      diameter of the primary tumor was measured in 132 patients, 22 by an ultrasound
      and the other patients by a CT scan. In 53 patients, the tumor size could not be 
      delimited and measured. Seventy-five patients (41%) had liver metastases at
      presentation of symptoms. Median survival for the entire patient group was only
      119 days. The median diameter of the patient's largest tumor was 4.35 cm, while
      the sample groups ranged from 1.2 to 14 cm. Patients were divided into two
      groups: those with a largest tumor diameter of </= 4.3 cm (66 patients) and those
      with a largest tumor diameter of > 4.3 cm (66 patients). Median survival for
      these groups was 149 and 94 days (p = 0.019), respectively. Cox regression showed
      a hazard ratio for tumor size of 1.48 (95% CI 1.02, 2.07) (p = 0.038), adjusted
      for the gemcitabine treatment which had been given to 49 patients and the
      presence of liver metastasis. In 88 patients, stricture length could be measured 
      at ERCP. When comparing stricture lengths of </= 2 cm and > 2 cm, no difference
      in survival time was noted within a Kaplan-Meier analysis. CONCLUSION: The size
      of the maximum tumor diameter of the primary tumor during the initial X-ray
      examination of patients with pancreatic cancer may predict survival time for
      those patients who had no surgical resection. Stricture length at ERCP gave no
      information on survival.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a lipophillic, highly diffusible, and short-lived
      physiological messenger which regulates a variety of physiopathological
      responses. NO may exert its cellular action through cGMP-dependent and
      cGMP-independent pathways which includes different postranslational
      modifications. The effect of NO in cancer depends on the activity and
      localization of NOS isoforms, concentration and duration of NO exposure, cellular
      sensitivity, and hypoxia/re-oxygenation process. NO regulates critical factors
      such as the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and p53 generally leading to
      growth arrest, apoptosis or adaptation. NO sensitizes hepatoma cells to
      chemotherapeutic compounds probably through increased p53 and cell death receptor
      expressions.

PG  - 881-98
LID - 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-12-0345 [doi]
AB  - Cancer cells must rewire cellular metabolism to satisfy the demands of growth and
      proliferation. Although many of the metabolic alterations are largely similar to 
      those in normal proliferating cells, they are aberrantly driven in cancer by a
      combination of genetic lesions and nongenetic factors such as the tumor
      microenvironment. However, a single model of altered tumor metabolism does not
      describe the sum of metabolic changes that can support cell growth. Instead, the 
      diversity of such changes within the metabolic program of a cancer cell can
      dictate by what means proliferative rewiring is driven, and can also impart
      heterogeneity in the metabolic dependencies of the cell. A better understanding
      of this heterogeneity may enable the development and optimization of therapeutic 
      strategies that target tumor metabolism.

AB  - Arsenic exposure and cigarette smoking are environmental risk factors for
      urothelial carcinoma (UC). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the key
      regulator of angiogenesis in various malignancies. This study investigates the
      joint effect of arsenic exposure, cigarette smoking, and VEGF polymorphisms on UC
      risk. This was a hospital-based case-control study consisting of 730
      histopathologically confirmed UC cases, including 470 bladder cancers, 260 upper 
      urinary tract UCs (UUTUCs), and 850 age-matched controls, recruited from
      September 1998 to December 2009. UC risk was estimated by odds ratios and 95%
      confidence intervals using unconditional logistic regression. Ever smokers with
      high arsenic exposure had significantly increased risks of 5.7 and 6.4 for
      bladder cancer and UUTUC, respectively. Moreover, ever smokers with high arsenic 
      exposure carrying 1 or 2 risk genotypes of the VEGF gene had a significantly
      increased risk of 6.6 for bladder cancer and a strikingly higher risk of 9.9 for 
      UUTUC. Additionally, UUTUC cases with high arsenic exposure carrying 1 or 2 risk 
      genotypes of the VEGF gene had a non-significant increased risk of advanced tumor
      stage. Our findings suggest that arsenic exposure, cigarette smoking, and risk
      genotypes of VEGF contribute to a higher risk of UUTUC than of bladder cancer.

TI  - Breast Cancer Incidence After Risk-Reducing Salpingo-Oophorectomy in BRCA1 and
      BRCA2 Mutation Carriers.
PG  - 1291-7
LID - 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-12-0190 [doi]
AB  - Premenopausal risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) in BRCA1/2 mutation
      carriers effectively reduces ovarian cancer risk, but also reduces breast cancer 
      risk. Breast cancer risk reductions up to 50% have been reported for both BRCA1
      and BRCA2 mutation carriers, but recent prospective studies were not able to
      reproduce this finding for BRCA1 mutation carriers. Breast cancer incidence after
      RRSO was assessed in a consecutive series of 104 BRCA1 and 58 BRCA2 mutation
      carriers. On the basis of data from our own centre, and assuming a 50% risk
      reduction through RRSO at premenopausal age, we expected to find 8 breast cancers
      (range 6-10) in this population for the reported screening period (532
      women-years). In 162 carriers with a median age of 41 years at RRSO, 13 incident 
      breast cancers were diagnosed. In BRCA1 mutation carriers, 12 incident breast
      cancers were found compared with 5 (range 3-6) expected and in BRCA2 mutation
      carriers 1 breast cancer was found compared with 3 (range 2-5) expected. Breast
      cancer incidence after premenopausal RRSO is still high, especially in BRCA1
      mutation carriers. Previously reported breast cancer risk reductions up to 50%
      were not confirmed. As a consequence, continued intensive screening for breast
      cancer is warranted in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers after RRSO.

TI  - Intracellular magnesium content decreases during mitochondria-mediated apoptosis 
      induced by a new indole-derivative in human colon cancer cells.
PG  - 104-11
LID - 10.1684/mrh.2012.0319 [doi]
AB  - A newly synthesized indole-derivative is able to induce cytostatic and cytotoxic 
      effects in the colon cancer cells HT29, effecting apoptosis by activation of an
      intrinsic pathway. Magnesium is involved in both cell growth and apoptosis even
      though its role in the latter process is not well defined. The aims of this work 
      were: firstly, to verify if magnesium content is related to the proliferative
      rate in HT29 cells; secondly, to assess the involvement of the cation in
      mitochondria-mediated apoptosis triggered by the new antiproliferative molecule. 
      The effects of the indole-derivative in treated cells included cell-cycle arrest 
      in the G2/M phase, and apoptotic death confirmed by release of cytochrome c from 
      the mitochondrial compartment. Moreover, we demonstrated that the basal content
      of magnesium in HT29 cells inversely correlates with cell saturation density. In 
      addition, a decrease in both free and intracellular total magnesium concentration
      was observed along with the induced apoptosis. Taken together, these data suggest
      that magnesium participates in the complex signaling network of cell
      proliferation and apoptosis.

LID - 10.1016/j.ejim.2012.08.018 [doi]
LID - S0953-6205(12)00238-5 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital-based palliative care programs in Lebanon are nonexistent in
      a structured form. One of obstacles is the lack of knowledge about symptom
      prevalence and burden of cancer patients in Lebanon. METHODS: This is a
      cross-sectional observational study where 100 adult cancer patients admitted to
      the American University of Beirut Medical Center inpatient unit completed a
      survey to assess 20 physical symptoms according the National Cancer Institute's
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE 4.0) guidelines.
      RESULTS: Hematologic, gastrointestinal, breast, and lung cancers were the most
      common. Mean age was 51.5 years; 51% were female. 74% of patients with solid
      tumors had metastatic disease. Treatment approaches were palliative chemotherapy,
      followed by curative chemotherapy and best supportive care. The most common
      symptoms were fatigue, appetite loss, nausea, and pain; most distressing were
      nausea, pain, and fatigue. Nausea and vomiting were more prevalent among females 
      than males. Females reported more severe vomiting than males, but males had more 
      intense pain. Overall symptom burden difference was statistically significant
      across age groups, with the 51-60 year group having the most symptoms, but not
      among different genders. Difference was significant among different treatment
      intents, with the best supportive care group having most symptoms. CONCLUSION:
      Fatigue should be better addressed as a legitimate symptom. Subgroup differences 
      must be considered when managing gastrointestinal symptoms. Pain should be more
      effectively managed, and vulnerable subgroups such as the 51-60 year age group
      and those on best supportive care should receive special consideration.

AB  - PURPOSE: A key barrier to identifying tissue biomarkers of clear cell renal cell 
      carcinoma is the heterogeneity of protein expression in tissue. However, by
      providing spectra for every 0.05 mm(2) area of tissue, imaging mass spectrometry 
      reveals the spatial distribution of peptides. We determined whether this approach
      could be used to identify and map protein signatures of clear cell renal cell
      carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed 2 tissue microarrays with 2
      cores each of matched tumor and normal tissue from the nephrectomy specimens of
      70 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Samples were analyzed by
      matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In 
      each tissue microarray peptide signatures were identified that differentiated
      cancer from normal tissue. The signatures were then cross validated. Mass
      spectrometry/mass spectrometry sequencing was performed to determine the identity
      of select, differentially expressed peptides. Immunohistochemistry was used for
      validation. RESULTS: In each tissue microarray peptide signatures were identified
      that had 94.7% to 98.5% classification accuracy for each 0.05 mm(2) spot
      (spectrum) and 96.9% to 100% accuracy for each tissue core. Cross validation
      across tissue microarrays revealed a classification accuracy of 82.6% to 84.7%
      for each spot and 88.9% to 92.4% for each core. We identified vimentin, histone
      2A.X and alpha-enolase as proteins with greater expression in cancer tissue. This
      was validated by immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSIONS: Imaging mass spectrometry
      identified and mapped specific peptides that accurately distinguished malignant
      from normal renal tissue. This demonstrates its potential as a novel, high
      throughput approach to clear cell renal cell carcinoma biomarker discovery. Given
      the multiple pathways and known heterogeneity involved in tumors such as clear
      cell renal cell carcinoma, multiple peptide signatures that maintain their
      spatial relationships may outperform traditional protein biomarkers.

TI  - Evaluation of anti-cancer activity of Acanthester planci extracts obtained by
      different methods of extraction.
PG  - 697-703
AB  - Acanthaster planci, the crown-of-thorns starfish, naturally endowed with the
      numerous toxic spines around the dorsal area of its body. Scientific
      investigations demonstrated several toxico-pharmacological efficacies of A.
      planci such as, myonecrotic activity, hemorrhagic activity, hemolytic activity,
      mouse lethality, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity, capillary
      permeability-increasing activity, edema-forming activity, anticoagulant activity 
      and histamine-releasing activity from mast cells. The present study was performed
      to evaluate the cytotoxic activity of A. planci extracts obtained by different
      methods of extraction on MCF-7 and HCT-116, human breast and colon cancer cell
      lines, respectively. Results of the cell proliferation assay showed that PBS
      extract exhibited very potent cytotoxic activity against both MCF-7 and HCT-116
      cell lines with IC(50) of 13.48 mug/mL and 28.78 mug/mL, respectively, while the 
      extracts prepared by Bligh and Dyer method showed moderate cytotoxicity effect
      against MCF-7 and HCT-116 cell lines, for chloroform extract, IC(50) = 121.37
      mug/mL (MCF-7) and 77.65 mug/mL (HCT-116), and for methanol extract, IC(50) =
      46.11 mug/mL (MCF-7) and 59.29 mug/mL (HCT-116). However, the extracts prepared
      by sequential extraction procedure from dried starfish found to be ineffective.
      This study paves the way for further investigation on the peptide composition in 
      the PBS extract of the starfish to discover potential chemotherapeutic agents.

TI  - Human Pappilomavirus (HPV) induced cancers and prevention by immunization.
PG  - 763-72
AB  - Incidences of different types of cancer are increasing in Pakistan, among which
      cancer of Cervix and Respiratory pappilomatosis are of great concern because of
      their association with human Pappilomavirus (HPV). Cervical cancers typically
      distress women of middle age or older; however it may affect women in any age
      after the puberty. Two serotypes of HPV (16 & 18) accounts 70% of cervical cancer
      cases, while HPV (6 & 11) are considered low-risk viruses associated with genital
      warts (Condyloma acuminata) and Respiratory pappilomatosis in both gender.
      Generally, there is transient role of HPV in human body and are removed by immune
      system in or around 1 year. Data from different Pakistani hospitals provides
      sound evidence for increasing trends of cervical cancer, which is, being
      developing country imperative for us. As the cost of cancer management is
      increasing day by day with poor survival rate and its burden is borne by patient,
      their family or society in-large, so if screening or prevention is possible then 
      there would be need to identify target population for screening and vaccination. 
      By quality adjusted life year (QALY) measurement, the data from different sources
      indicates that adolescent age is the appropriate target population and is cost
      effective for vaccination. Two vaccines manufactured by recombinant DNA
      technology are licensed in some parts of the world for prevention of HPV related 
      cancers, however both have certain advantage over another, as one of the vaccines
      contains viral like proteins of two HPV serotypes 16 & 18 and provide additional 
      cross protection against HPV type 13 and 45 with 100% seroprotection, while the
      other vaccine, being quadrivalent offers protection against four serotypes 6, 11,
      16 and 18. Both vaccines tolerability and safety profiles are similar and
      acceptable, however bivalent vaccine appears to provide long-lasting immunity by 
      the development of memory B-cells hypothetically due to difference of adsorbing
      agent used by manufacturer, on the other hand, quadrivalent vaccine offers
      protection against cervical cancer but also offers additional protection against 
      Condyloma acuminata and respiratory Pappilomatosis. As these vaccines are new in 
      the market and initial trials indicate availability of antibodies for up to
      around 5 years i.e. why it is controversial at the moment that whether booster
      dose is recommended or not, however it is assumed that, there is no harm to have 
      booster dose at 5th year of vaccination.

TI  - Basal but not luminal mammary epithelial cells require PI3K/mTOR signaling for
      Ras-driven overgrowth.
PG  - 5856-66
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1635 [doi]
AB  - The mammary ducts of humans and mice are comprised of two main mammary epithelial
      cell (MEC) subtypes: a surrounding layer of basal MECs and an inner layer of
      luminal MECs. Breast cancer subtypes show divergent clinical behavior that may
      reflect properties inherent in their MEC compartment of origin. How the response 
      to a cancer-initiating genetic event is shaped by MEC subtype remains largely
      unexplored. Using the mouse mammary gland, we designed organotypic
      three-dimensional culture models that permit challenge of discrete MEC
      compartments with the same oncogenic insult. Mammary organoids were prepared from
      mice engineered for compartment-restricted coexpression of oncogenic H-RAS(G12V) 
      together with a nuclear fluorescent reporter. Monitoring of
      H-RAS(G12V)-expressing MECs during extended live cell imaging permitted
      visualization of Ras-driven phenotypes via video microscopy. Challenging either
      basal or luminal MECs with H-RAS(G12V) drove MEC proliferation and survival,
      culminating in aberrant organoid overgrowth. In each compartment, Ras activation 
      triggered modes of collective MEC migration and invasion that contrasted with
      physiologic modes used during growth factor-initiated branching morphogenesis.
      Although basal and luminal Ras activation produced similar overgrowth phenotypes,
      inhibitor studies revealed divergent use of Ras effector pathways. Blocking
      either the phosphoinositide 3-kinase or the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway
      completely suppressed Ras-driven invasion and overgrowth of basal MECs, but only 
      modestly attenuated Ras-driven phenotypes in luminal MECs. We show that MEC
      subtype defines signaling pathway dependencies downstream of Ras. Thus,
      cells-of-origin may critically determine the drug sensitivity profiles of mammary
      neoplasia.

TI  - Inactivation of the Dlc1 gene cooperates with downregulation of p15INK4b and
      p16Ink4a, leading to neoplastic transformation and poor prognosis in human
      cancer.

AB  - The tumor suppressor gene deleted in liver cancer-1 (DLC1), which encodes a
      protein with strong RhoGAP (GTPase activating protein) activity and weak Cdc42GAP
      activity, is inactivated in various human malignancies. Following Dlc1
      inactivation, mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) with a conditional Dlc1 knockout
      allele reproducibly underwent neoplastic transformation. In addition to
      inactivation of Dlc1 and increased activity of Rho and Cdc42, transformation
      depended on the subsequent decreased expression of the Cdk4/6 inhibitors
      p15(Ink4b) and p16(Ink4a) together with increased expression and activation of
      Cdk4/6. The level of expression of these cell-cycle regulatory genes was relevant
      to human tumors with low DLC1 expression. Analysis of publicly available
      annotated datasets of lung and colon cancer with gene expression microarray
      profiles indicated that, in pairwise comparisons, low DLC1 expression occurred
      frequently together (P < 0.01) with downregulation of p15(Ink4b) or p16(Ink4a) or
      upregulation of CDK4 or CDK6. In addition, an unfavorable prognosis (P < 0.05)
      was associated with low DLC1 and low p15(Ink4b) in lung cancer and colon cancer, 
      low DLC1 and low p16(Ink4a) in lung cancer, low DLC1 and high CDK4 in lung
      cancer, and low DLC1 and high CDK6 in colon cancer. Thus, several genes and
      biochemical activities collaborate with the inactivation of DLC1 to give rise to 
      cell transformation in MEFs, and the identified genes are relevant to human
      tumors with low DLC1 expression.

PG  - 6191-9
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-4079 [doi]
AB  - Microbubble contrast agents can specifically deliver nucleic acids to target
      tissues when exposed to ultrasound treatment parameters that mediate microbubble 
      destruction. In this study, we evaluated whether microbubbles and
      ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) could be used to enhance
      delivery of EGF receptor (EGFR)-directed siRNA to murine squamous cell
      carcinomas. Custom-designed microbubbles efficiently bound siRNA and mediated
      RNAse protection. UTMD-mediated delivery of microbubbles loaded with
      EGFR-directed siRNA to murine squamous carcinoma cells in vitro reduced EGFR
      expression and EGF-dependent growth, relative to delivery of control siRNA.
      Similarly, serial UTMD-mediated delivery of EGFR siRNA to squamous cell carcinoma
      in vivo decreased EGFR expression and increased tumor doubling time, relative to 
      controls receiving EGFR siRNA-loaded microbubbles but not ultrasound or control
      siRNA-loaded microbubbles and UTMD. Taken together, our results offer a
      preclinical proof-of-concept for customized microbubbles and UTMD to deliver
      gene-targeted siRNA for cancer therapy.

TI  - Celecoxib induces proliferation and Amphiregulin production in colon

AB  - The COX-2 inhibitor Celecoxib, tested in phase III trials for the prevention of
      sporadic colon adenomas, reduced the appearance of new adenomas, but was unable
      to affect the incidence of colon cancer. Moreover the 5years follow-up showed
      that patients discontinuing Celecoxib treatment had an increased incidence of
      adenomas as compared to the placebo arm. In the APC(min/+) mouse model short term
      treatment with Celecoxib reduced gut adenomas, but a prolonged administration of 
      the drug induced fibroblast activation and intestinal fibrosis with a final tumor
      burden. The way Celecoxib could directly activate human colon myofibroblasts (MF)
      has not yet been investigated. We found that MF are activated by non toxic doses 
      of Celecoxib. Celecoxib induces erk1-2 and Akt phosphorylation within 5'. This
      short term activation is apparently insufficient to cause phenotypic changes, but
      the contemporary triggering of EGFR causes an impressive synergic effect inducing
      MF proliferation and the neo-expression and release of Amphiregulin (AREG), a
      well known EGFR agonist involved in colon cancer progression. As a confirm to
      these observations, the erk inhibitor U0126 and the EGFR inhibitors Tyrphostin
      and Cetuximab were able to contrast AREG induction. Our data provide evidence
      that Celecoxib directly activates MF empowering EGFR signaling. According to
      these results the association with EGFR (or erk1-2) inhibitors could abolish the 
      off-target activity of Celecoxib, possibly extending the potential of this drug
      for colon cancer prevention.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite the well characterized clinical course of 'pure' SCLC,
      there have not been many data on combined SCLC, ie, tumors, which contain both
      small-cell and non-small-cell components. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 1628
      consecutive cases of lung cancer (1200 NSCLC, 428 SCLC) at our institution over
      the past decade. We identified 22 patients with C-SCLC. The pathologic and
      clinical characteristics of these patients were reviewed. Survival analysis was
      performed and prognostic factors were assessed. These data were compared with the
      results obtained from our 406 pure SCLC patients who presented during the same
      time period. RESULTS: The most common pathology was combined small-cell and
      large-cell with 16 cases followed by combined small- and squamous-cell carcinoma 
      (3 cases), 2 cases of small-cell and nonspecified NSCLC, and 1 case of small cell
      and adenocarcinoma. Overall survival was significantly higher in C-SCLC patients 
      compared with pure SCLC (median 15 vs. 10.8 months; P = .035). Surgery was
      significantly more common in this group of patients (45% vs. 3% in the pure small
      cell group; P < .0001). No difference in overall survival was observed in
      patients with C-SCLC and patients with pure SCLC, that did not receive surgery (P
      = .64). CONCLUSION: Patients with combined SCLC carry a better prognosis than
      those with pure small-cell variety and are more likely to undergo surgery.

TI  - Distinguishing features of cancer patients who smoke: pain, symptom burden, and
      risk for opioid misuse.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Although many cancer patients who have pain are smokers, the extent
      of their symptom burden and risk for opioid misuse are not well understood. In
      this study we analyzed records of patients being treated for cancer pain, 94 of
      whom were smokers and 392 of whom were nonsmokers, to determine smoking status
      group differences. Smokers had significantly higher pain intensity, fatigue,
      depression, and anxiety than nonsmokers (independent samples t-tests P < .002).
      Smokers were at higher risk for opioid misuse based on the short form of the
      Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain (SOAPP). Specifically,
      smokers had more frequent problems with mood swings, taking medications other
      than how they are prescribed, a history of illegal drug use, and a history of
      legal problems (chi-square tests P </= .002). Changes in pain and opioid use were
      examined in a subset of patients (146 nonsmokers and 46 smokers) who were
      receiving opioid therapy on at least 2 of the 3 data time points (consult,
      follow-up 1 month after consult, follow-up 6 to 9 months after consult). Results 
      based on multilevel linear modeling showed that over a period of approximately 6 
      months, smokers continued to report significantly higher pain than nonsmokers.
      Both smokers and nonsmokers reported a significant decline in pain across the
      6-month period; the rate of decline did not differ across smokers and nonsmokers.
      No significant difference over time was found in opioid use between smokers and
      nonsmokers. These findings will guide subsequent studies and inform clinical
      practice, particularly the relevancy of smoking cessation. PERSPECTIVE: This
      article describes pain, symptom burden, and risk for opioid misuse among cancer
      patients with pain across smoking status. Smoking appears to be a potential
      mechanism for having an increased pain and symptom burden and risk for opioid
      misuse. This improved understanding of cancer pain will inform clinical practice.

AB  - The nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), an
      important carcinogen found in tobacco products, causes lung cancer in genetically
      susceptible animals. In addition to mutations of the K-Ras gene, NNK has
      non-mutagenic effects that include alterations in gene expression and
      immunomodulation in the lung. Here we report the identification of two gene sets 
      associated with NNK-induced pulmonary tumourigenesis. First, to identify genes
      involved in the susceptibility to NNK, we compared the lung transcriptomes of
      NNK-resistant C3H mice with that of the NNK-susceptible A/J mice, identifying
      differential expression of genes related to innate immunity and inflammation.
      Second, to identify gene expression induced by NNK, we compared the lung
      transcriptomes of C3H and A/J mice post-treatment. The Resistin-like alpha
      (Retnla) gene was highly upregulated in response to NNK only in susceptible mice.
      This gene product is known to recruit immune cells to the lung, and accumulation 
      of CD45 positive cells in A/J lungs correlated with increased Retnla expression. 
      Genetic susceptibility to NNK-induced lung tumourigenesis may relate in part to
      gene expression changes and alterations in the immune response to create a
      pro-tumourigenic environment, acting in concert with NNK's mutagenic effects.

      (1-2), and a new quinolone alkaloid, helicterone A (3), along with thirteen known
      compounds (4-16). The structures of new compounds were established by analysis of
      extensive spectroscopic data. The absolute configuration of 1 was determined by
      application of the modified Mosher's method. All of the isolates were evaluated
      for their anti-proliferative activities against HT-29 human colon cancer cells
      and OVCA 429 ovarian cancer cells by MTT assay.

AB  - Despite of the fact that a large amount of therapeutic agents have been developed
      for cancer treatment, we are still sometimes in a dilemma of choosing a most
      effective regimen for individual. With the reference of several recent
      researches, positive clinical correlations have been identified with primary
      tumor xenografts models, but limitations in existed models reveals a need for
      improvement. Over the past decade, conceptual progress has been made that tumors 
      had increasingly been recognized as organs in which ostensibly normal cells as
      well as cancer cells participate actively in tumorigenesis by creating the "tumor
      microenvironment". Herein, we propose a hypothesis based on this novel conception
      that if transplanted as an organ, tumor implantation in nude mice would conserve 
      most approximated biological traits with improved success rate, which make
      personalized tumor xenograft model practical for pre-clinical trials as
      substitutes for each patient. In our pilot study, intact tumor bloc was applied
      in implantation to evaluate this notion. As a result, 107 xenografts from all 20 
      patients of gastric cancer were transplanted successfully. Pathological
      comparison confirmed that no differences between xenografts and primary tumors
      while the therapeutic response to two chemotherapeutic agents, docetaxel and
      pemetrexed, exhibited differently. In conclusion, applying personalized primary
      tumor xenograft model derived from freshly excised tumor in pre-clinic trails
      would potentially lead to a more effective customized chemotherapy.

      thoracoscopic surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thoracoscopic surgery has become very popular in recent years.
      Conventional thoracoscopic surgery requires three or more port wounds for
      manipulations of endoscopic instruments. For complicated cancer surgery, more
      port wounds and a larger thoracotomy wound may be required due to technical
      reasons. We want to investigate the effectiveness of single-port thoracoscopic
      approach in elective thoracoscopic surgery for thoracic disease. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: From July 1st, 2010 to March 31, 2011, 90 consecutive patients underwent
      general thoracoscopic surgery performed by the same thoracic surgeon. Two
      patients with severe trauma and massive bleeding were excluded from the study.
      All patients included had thoracoscopic surgery with a single-port approach. The 
      surgical outcomes, complications, mortality and conversion rates were recorded
      and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 88 patients were included in this study. All
      these patients were operated on by the same surgeon. For sixty-eight patients,
      the single-port thoracoscopic approach was used. Nineteen patients were changed
      to a two-port thoracoscopic approach and one patient's was changed to
      mini-thoracotomy. Two patients died from terminal lung cancer and severe mitral
      regurgitation. Complications occurred in six cases. Eighty-seven patients (98.8%)
      were effectively managed with either single-port or a two-port approach. Only one
      patient was managed by mini-thoracotomy. CONCLUSION: Elective thoracoscopic
      surgery performed through a single-port wound is feasible. Single-incisional
      thoracoscopic surgery can be safely applied as a first-line approach in most
      cases of elective thoracoscopic procedures.

TI  - Parkin induces apoptotic cell death in TNF-alpha-treated cervical cancer cells.
PG  - 526-31
AB  - Many malignant tumors become resistant to tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      (TNF-alpha)-induced cell death during carcinogenesis. In the present study, we
      examined whether parkin acts as a tumor suppressor in HeLa cells, a human
      cervical cancer cell line resistant to TNF-alpha-induced cell death.
      TNF-alpha-treatment alone did not affect HeLa cell viability. However, expression
      of parkin restored TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. Increased cell
      death was due to the activation of the apoptotic pathway. Expression of parkin in
      TNF-alpha-treated HeLa cells stimulated cleavage of the pro-apoptotic proteins
      caspase-8, -9, -3, -7 and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). In addition, parkin 
      expression resulted in decreased expression of the caspase inhibitory protein,
      survivin. These results suggest that parkin acts as a tumor suppressor in human
      cervical cancer cells by modulating survivin expression and caspase activity. We 
      propose that this pathway is a novel molecular mechanism by which parkin
      functions as a tumor suppressor.

AB  - Ferrocene (Fc) and its conjugates have attracted considerable attention in recent
      years due to their unique electrochemical behavior and significant biological
      activities such as antitumor, antimalarial, and antifungal. Arg-Gly-Asp
      (RGD)-containing peptides, because of their selective binding to integrins which 
      are highly expressed in tumor-induced angiogenesis, play a key role in cancer
      targeted therapy. In this study, Fc-RGD and Fc-Am-RGD (Fc: ferrocenoyl; Am:
      6-aminohexanoic acid) conjugates were synthesized, and the antitumor activities
      in vitro were investigated. The cell uptake of the conjugates by B16 murine
      melanoma cells was measured using HPLC-electrochemical method. The antitumor
      activities of the conjugates were also evaluated by
      3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow
      cytometric measurements. The experimental results revealed that Fc-RGD and
      Fc-Am-RGD exhibit more effective antitumor activities than their parent compounds
      RGD and Fc-COOH. Moreover, it is found that Fc-Am-RGD yields the lowest IC(50)
      values of 5.2 +/- 1.4 muM toward B16 cells. The HPLC-electrochemical studies
      confirmed that the insertion of flexible alkyl spacer Am between Fc and RGD
      significantly increases the cell uptake toward B16 cells and consequently
      improves the antitumor activity. Our results suggest that Fc-RGD and Fc-Am-RGD
      conjugates are potential candidates for cancer treatment.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer
      mortality. Metastasis is the major concern that causes death in HCC. The goal of 
      this study was to identify tumor-derived proteins in serum during HCC metastasis 
      using an orthotopic xenograft tumor model and explore the role of key protein in 
      HCC metastasis. Serum samples collected from HCCLM3-R metastatic HCC tumor model 
      at specific stages of metastasis (1 wk, 3 wks and 6 wks) were subjected to iTRAQ 
      labeling followed by 2DLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. Twenty tumor-derived proteins were 
      identified through human specific peptides. Secretory clusterin (sCLU), which was
      significantly upregulated during cancer progression and metastasis, was chosen
      for further study. The expression of sCLU was significantly higher in metastatic 
      HCC cell lines and samples from metastatic HCC patients. ShRNA-mediated
      down-regulation of sCLU resulted in a reduced migratory capacity in HCC cell
      lines, as well as a reduction in pulmonary metastasis in vivo. Overexpression of 
      sCLU in HepG2 cell line showed increased cell migratory ability. Further study
      found that sCLU contributed to HCC migration and epithelial-mesenchymal
      transition (EMT) in vitro, and metastasis in vivo. In addition, sCLU also plays
      an important role in the regulation of TGF-beta1-smad3 signaling. These findings 
      suggest that sCLU may promote HCC metastasis via the induction of EMT process and
      may be a candidate target for HCC therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Romidepsin (FK228) was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment 
      of cutaneous and peripheral T cell lymphoma. We have shown in vitro efficacy of
      FK228 in ovarian cancer. Here, our goal was to evaluate FK228 combined with
      cisplatin in ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Ovarian cancer cell
      lines were treated with cisplatin, FK228 or the combination of drugs.
      Colorimetric assays were used to determine cytotoxicity in vitro. Mice engrafted 
      with 5x10(6) SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells were treated with cisplatin, FK228 or
      the combination, and tumor weights and volumes were measured. We assessed
      molecular markers of proliferation (mib-1), apoptosis (cleaved PARP and cleaved
      caspase 3) and DNA damage (pH2AX, RAD51 and 53BP1). RESULTS: FK228 enhanced the
      cytotoxic effects of cisplatin in ovarian cells compared to vehicle-treated
      controls or each drug alone. The combination of FK228 and cisplatin-induced
      apoptosis and activated aberrant DNA damage responses demonstrated by increased
      expression of pH2AX, RAD51 and 53BP1. Mice treated with FK228, cisplatin and both
      drugs showed reduced tumor weights and volumes. Drug-treated tumors showed
      decreased mib-1 and increased cleaved-caspase 3 expression levels. The number and
      intensity of pH2AX stained cells was greatest in tumors exposed to the
      combination of FK228 and cisplatin. CONCLUSION: FK228 causes DNA damage-induced
      apoptosis and enhances the anti-tumor effects of cisplatin. The DNA damage mark
      pH2AX is activated by FK228 and cisplatin and may be a useful pharmacodynamic
      mark of these effects.

TI  - Salvage stereotactic body radiotherapy for patients with limited prostate cancer 
      metastases: deferring androgen deprivation therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated whether repeated stereotactic body radiotherapy
      (SBRT) of oligometastatic disease is able to defer the initiation of palliative
      androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in patients with low-volume bone and lymph
      node metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with up to 3 synchronous
      metastases (bone and/or lymph nodes) diagnosed on positron emission tomography,
      following biochemical recurrence after local curative treatment, were treated
      with (repeated) SBRT to a dose of 50 Gy in 10 fractions. Androgen deprivation
      therapy-free survival (ADT-FS) defined as the time interval between the first day
      of SBRT and the initiation of ADT was the primary end point. ADT was initiated if
      more than 3 metastases were detected during follow-up even when patients were
      still asymptomatic or in case of a prostate specific antigen elevation above 50
      ng/mL in the absence of metastases. Secondary end points were local control,
      clinical progression-free survival, and toxicity. Toxicity was scored using the
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. RESULTS: We treated 24 patients
      with a median follow-up of 24 months. Ten patients started with ADT resulting in 
      a median ADT-FS of 38 months. The 2-year local control and clinical
      progression-free survival was 100% and 42%, respectively. Eleven and 3 patients, 
      respectively, required a second and third salvage treatment for metachronous
      low-volume metastatic disease. No grade 3 toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION:
      Repeated salvage SBRT is feasible, well tolerated and defers palliative ADT with 
      a median of 38 months in patients with limited bone or lymph node PCa metastases.

      cells.

AB  - All living cells utilize intricate DNA repair mechanisms to address numerous
      types of DNA lesions and to preserve genomic integrity, and pluripotent stem
      cells have specific needs due to their remarkable ability of self-renewal and
      differentiation into different functional cell types. Not surprisingly, human
      stem cells possess a highly efficient DNA repair network that becomes less
      efficient upon differentiation. Moreover, these cells also have an anaerobic
      metabolism, which reduces the mitochondria number and the likelihood of oxidative
      stress, which is highly related to genomic instability. If DNA lesions are not
      repaired, human stem cells easily undergo senescence, cell death or
      differentiation, as part of their DNA damage response, avoiding the propagation
      of stem cells carrying mutations and genomic alterations. Interestingly, cancer
      stem cells and typical stem cells share not only the differentiation potential
      but also their capacity to respond to DNA damage, with important implications for
      cancer therapy using genotoxic agents. On the other hand, the preservation of the
      adult stem cell pool, and the ability of cells to deal with DNA damage, is
      essential for normal development, reducing processes of neurodegeneration and
      premature aging, as one can observe on clinical phenotypes of many human genetic 
      diseases with defects in DNA repair processes. Finally, several recent findings
      suggest that DNA repair also plays a fundamental role in maintaining the
      pluripotency and differentiation potential of embryonic stem cells, as well as
      that of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. DNA repair processes also seem to
      be necessary for the reprogramming of human cells when iPS cells are produced.
      Thus, the understanding of how cultured pluripotent stem cells ensure the genetic
      stability are highly relevant for their safe therapeutic application, at the same
      time that cellular therapy is a hope for DNA repair deficient patients.

AB  - The cytosolic thioredoxin (Trx1) system is essential for maintaining a reduced
      intracellular environment, via reduced Trx1 acting as a general protein disulfide
      reductase. Trx1 is implicated in cell signaling such as proliferation, DNA
      synthesis, enzyme activation, cell cycle regulation, transcription, gene
      activation, and prevention of apoptosis. Human Trx1 contains the active-site
      cysteines, Cys32 and Cys35, and three additional structural cysteines, Cys62,
      Cys69, and Cys73, that regulate Trx1 structure and activity via a second
      disulfide formation, S-glutathionylation or S-nitrosylation. The present study
      uses an electrophoretic redox Western blot method to analyze the oxidation state 
      of Trx1 in vivo separating the protein-changed isoform following alkylation with 
      iodoacetic acid in 8M urea. Treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA
      increased Trx1 inhibitor thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip) levels,
      decreased Trx1 activity, and switched the Trx1 oxidation state toward a more
      oxidized one, as a result of complex formation with Trx1, and increased reactive 
      oxygen species (ROS). SAHA is currently in clinical trials for cancer treatment, 
      and one possible mechanism for its anticancer effect is via effects on the Trx1
      system. Determining the exact oxidation state of human cytosolic Trx1 may be
      useful in developing and evaluating cancer drugs and antioxidant agents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was to determine preoperative serum levels of epidermal
      growth factor (EGF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in stage 
      III colon cancer and correlate them with disease status and prognosis. The
      circulating EGF in correlation with primary site epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) was also evaluated. METHODS: Seventy-seven patients with curatively
      resected stage III colon cancer were selected for analysis. Enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay was used to determine EGF and IL-6 serum levels, and serum
      CRP levels were measured via immunoturbidimetry. EGFR expression was observed
      with immunohistochemical studies. RESULTS: The median levels of EGFR, IL-6, and
      CRP were 189.4 pg/mL, 9.09 pg/mL, and 1.4 mg/mL, respectively. The factors
      related to recurrence with statistical significance included positive node status
      (P = 0.041), lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.001), and preoperative IL-6 level
      >/=9 pg/mL (P = 0.020). CRP and EGF levels were not significantly associated with
      disease-free survival rates (P = 0.438 and P = 0.309, respectively). Multivariate
      analysis using Cox's proportion model revealed that lymph node status was the
      single independent prognostic factor for predicting time until recurrence (odds
      ratio, 4.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-22.91; P = 0.038). CONCLUSION: IL-6
      expression in stage III colon cancer patients appears to be a prognostic marker
      of tumor behavior. No correlations between serum EGF concentrations and tumor
      EGFR positivity were found in this study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-expandable metal stents are effective palliation for malignant
      gastric outlet obstruction. The aims of study were to evaluate efficacy and
      safety of double-layered Comvi, uncovered and covered stent to find out protocols
      which enhance stent patency. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data from 224
      patients who underwent endoscopic stent placement for malignant gastric outlet
      obstruction caused by stomach cancer from 2006 to 2011. Technical and clinical
      success rates were evaluated and clinical outcomes were compared according to
      stent types and chemotherapy. RESULTS: The overall technical and clinical success
      rates were achieved in 99.6% and 80.4%, respectively without immediate
      complications. The clinical success rate was not significantly different between 
      three groups. The median stent patency time was 156 days [interquartile range
      66-279] without differences between groups. The 4-, 8-, and 12-week patency rates
      were 89.4%, 77.3%, and 61.2%, respectively with no differences between groups.
      The re-stenosis of stent frequently occurred in the case of the uncovered stents,
      while migration was more likely to be observed for the covered and Comvi stent.
      Chemotherapy significantly lowered re-intervention rates, especially in uncovered
      stents. CONCLUSIONS: Patency rates are significantly improved by combining the
      use of uncovered stent with follow-up chemotherapy treatment, which retains the
      advantages of the mechanical and chemical aspects of stent and chemotherapy,
      respectively.

AB  - Trends in current epidemiological data suggest that the incidence of inflammatory
      bowel diseases is changing. Eastern Europe previously was seen as a low incidence
      area; however, new data confirm that incidence and prevalence are quickly
      increasing in some countries, reaching moderate-to-high incidence as reported in 
      Western European countries. The quality of the studies also improved. Recently,
      data became available on the natural history of the disease from Eastern European
      countries. Current trends are similar to those reported from Western Europe and
      North America, including less complicated disease at diagnosis, accelerated use
      of immunomodulators and decreased need for surgery in Crohn's disease, more cases
      of proctitis and relatively low colorectal cancer risk in ulcerative colitis. In 
      addition, in-depth analysis of disease course enabled the identification of
      possible predictive factors leading to some novel findings, such as the
      association between the decline in surgery risk and early treatment strategy. In 
      contrast, some unexplained differences exist, such as the low overall colectomy
      risk in ulcerative colitis.

AB  - AIMS: The association between GLP-1 agonists, acute pancreatitis (AP), any cancer
      and thyroid cancer is discussed. This meta-analysis was aimed at evaluating the
      risk of those serious adverse events associated with GLP-1 agonists in patients
      with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and
      clinicaltrials.gov were searched in order to identify longitudinal studies
      evaluating exenatide or liraglutide use and reporting data on AP or cancer. Odds 
      ratios (ORs) were pooled using a random-effects model. I(2) statistics assessed
      heterogeneity. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies were included. Neither exenatide (OR 
      0.84 [95% CI 0.58-1.22], I(2) = 30%) nor liraglutide (OR 0.97 [95% CI 0.21-4.39],
      I(2) = 0%) were associated with an increased risk of AP, independent of baseline 
      comparator. The pooled OR for cancer associated with exenatide was 0.86 (95% CI
      0.29, 2.60, I(2) = 0%) and for liraglutide was 1.35 (95% CI 0.70, 2.59, I(2) =
      0%). Liraglutide was not associated with an increased risk for thyroid cancer (OR
      1.54 [95% CI 0.40-6.02], I(2) = 0%). For exenatide, no thyroid malignancies were 
      reported. CONCLUSIONS: Current available published evidence is insufficient to
      support an increased risk of AP or cancer associated with GLP-1 agonists. These
      rare and long-term adverse events deserve properly monitoring in future studies
      evaluating GLP-1 agonists.

AB  - Heparin, a potent anticoagulant used for the prevention of venous
      thromboembolism, has been recognized as a tumor angiogenesis inhibitor. Its
      limitation in clinical application for cancer therapy, however, arises from its
      strong anticoagulant activity, which causes associated adverse effects. In this
      study, we show the structural correlation of LHT7, a previously developed
      heparin-based angiogenesis inhibitor, with its influence on VEGF blockade and its
      decreased anticoagulant activity. LHT7 was characterized as having average seven 
      molecules of sodium taurocholates conjugated to one molecule of
      low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). This study showed that the conjugation of
      sodium taurocholates selectively blocked interaction with antithrombin III
      (ATIII) while enhancing the binding with VEGF. This resulted in LHT7 to have
      negligible anticoagulant activity but potent anti-angiogenic activity. Following 
      up on this finding, we showed that the bidirectional effect of sodium
      taurocholate conjugation was due to its unique structure, that is, the sterane
      core hindering the ATIII-binding pentasaccharide unit of LMWH with its bulky and 
      rigid structural characteristics while the terminal sulfate group interacts with 
      VEGF to produce stronger binding. In addition, we showed that LHT7 was localized 
      in the tumor, especially on the endothelial cells. One explanation for this might
      be that LHT7 was delivered to the tumor via platelets.

AB  - Recent studies have implied that miRNAs act as crucial modulators for
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We found that miR-134 expression
      correlated with invasive potential and EMT phenotype of NSCLC cells. Functional
      assays demonstrated that miR-134 inhibited EMT in NSCLC cells. In addition, we
      showed that Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) is a direct target of miR-134. Knockdown of
      FOXM1 reversed EMT resembling that of miR-134 overexpression. We further found
      that FOXM1 was involved in TGF-beta1-induced EMT in A549 cells. These findings
      suggest that miR-134 acts as a novel EMT suppressor in NSCLC cells.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The diagnosis of cervical lymph node metastasis in head and neck
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients constitutes an essential requirement for
      clinical staging and treatment selection. However, clinical assessment by
      physical examination and different imaging modalities, as well as by histological
      examination of routine lymph node cryosections can miss micrometastases, while
      false positives may lead to unnecessary elective lymph node neck resections.
      Here, we explored the feasibility of developing a sensitive assay system for
      desmoglein 3 (DSG3) as a predictive biomarker for lymph node metastasis in HNSCC.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: DSG3 expression was determined in multiple general cancer-
      and HNSCC-tissue microarrays (TMAs), in negative and positive HNSCC metastatic
      cervical lymph nodes, and in a variety of HNSCC and control cell lines. A
      nanostructured immunoarray system was developed for the ultrasensitive detection 
      of DSG3 in lymph node tissue lysates. RESULTS: We demonstrate that DSG3 is highly
      expressed in all HNSCC lesions and their metastatic cervical lymph nodes, but
      absent in non-invaded lymph nodes. We show that DSG3 can be rapidly detected with
      high sensitivity using a simple microfluidic immunoarray platform, even in human 
      tissue sections including very few HNSCC invading cells, hence distinguishing
      between positive and negative lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: We provide a proof of
      principle supporting that ultrasensitive nanostructured assay systems for DSG3
      can be exploited to detect micrometastatic HNSCC lesions in lymph nodes, which
      can improve the diagnosis and guide in the selection of appropriate therapeutic
      intervention modalities for HNSCC patients.

TI  - Quantification and normalization of x-ray mammograms.
PG  - 6519-40
LID - 10.1088/0031-9155/57/20/6519 [doi]
AB  - The analysis of (x-ray) mammograms remains qualitative, relying on the judgement 
      of clinicians. We present a novel method to compute a quantitative, normalized
      measure of tissue radiodensity traversed by the primary beam incident on each
      pixel of a mammogram, a measure we term the standard attenuation rate (SAR). SAR 
      enables: the estimation of breast density which is linked to cancer risk; direct 
      comparison between images; the full potential of computer aided diagnosis to be
      utilized; and a basis for digital breast tomosynthesis reconstruction. It does
      this by removing the effects of the imaging conditions under which the mammogram 
      is acquired. First, the x-ray spectrum incident upon the breast is calculated,
      and from this, the energy exiting the breast is calculated. The contribution of
      scattered radiation is calculated and subtracted. The SAR measure is the scaling 
      factor that must be applied to the reference material in order to match the
      primary attenuation of the breast. Specifically, this is the scaled reference
      material attenuation which when traversed by an identical beam to that traversing
      the breast, and when subsequently detected, results in the primary component of
      the pixel intensity observed in the breast image. We present results using two
      tissue equivalent phantoms, as well as a sensitivity analysis to detector
      response changes over time and possible errors in compressed thickness
      measurement.

AB  - AIM: The importance of the alteration of tumor infiltrative lymphocytes (CD4(+), 
      CD8(+), CD16(+), and CD56(+)) in colorectal cancer prognosis is well known. In
      this study, we analyzed the effect of preoperative immunonutrition and different 
      nutritional models on the clinical condition of colorectal cancer patients.
      METHODS: Twenty-eight colorectal cancer patients were grouped into 4 groups
      according to their nutrition regimens randomly and were given immunonutrition
      (IMN), standard enteral (SE), total parental nutrition (TPN), and normal
      nutrition (NN) regimens, all of which contained the same calorie-nitrogen content
      within a 7-day preoperative period. All patients had an endoscopic biopsy before 
      and after the regimen, and the lymphocyte population infiltrating mucosal parts
      of the resected tumor tissue were evaluated. Immunohistochemical analysis of the 
      tissue specimens was performed by staining with antihuman CD4(+), CD8(+),
      CD16(+), and CD56(+) antibodies. RESULTS: After nutrition, there were significant
      increases in each of the 4 groups of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells within the tumor.
      Comparing the rates of augmentation, the increased rates of the CD8(+) cells
      infiltrating the tumor after nutrition in the patients who were fed with IMN were
      significantly more than the ones in other groups (P = .01). CD16(+) cell
      infiltration was significantly higher in all groups except the SE and IMN groups.
      The SE group had increased CD56(+) cell infiltration compared with the other
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the colorectal cancer patients who had nutrition in the
      7-day preoperative period, except for the SE nutrition group, there were
      significant increases of infiltration of CD56(+) cells at the mucosal part of the
      tumor tissue within the CD4(+) and CD8(+) cell population. When postnutrition
      values were compared, there was a marked increase of CD8(+) cells in the IMN
      group.

TI  - Methylation of the polycomb group target genes is a possible biomarker for
      favorable prognosis in colorectal cancer.
PG  - 2069-75
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-0755 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer in the
      Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with ever increasing incidence rates. DNA methylation is 
      a common event in CRC where it is now considered an important phenomenon in CRC
      carcinogenesis and useful for the classification and prognosis of CRC. METHODS:
      To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underpinning CRC in Saudi Arabian
      patients, we profiled the DNA methylation frequency of key genes (MLH1, MSH2,
      RASSF1A, SLIT2, HIC1, MGMT, SFRP1, MYOD1, APC, CDKN2A, as well as five CIMP
      markers) in 120 sporadic CRC cases. CRC tumors originating from the rectum, left,
      and right colons are represented in this cohort of formalin-fixed
      paraffin-embedded tissues. RESULTS: The most common methylation frequency was
      detected in the polycomb group target genes (PCGT) including SFRP1 (70%), MYOD1
      (60.8%), HIC1 (61.7%), and SLIT2 (56.7%). In addition, MGMT methylation was
      detected at a high frequency (68.3%). RASSF1A, APC, and CDKN2A methylation
      frequencies were 42.5%, 25%, and 32.8%, respectively. K-means clustering analysis
      of the methylation events results in the clustering of the CRC samples into three
      groups depending on the level of methylation detected. CONCLUSION: Group II (PCGT
      methylation and CIMP-negative) methylation signature carried a favorable
      prognosis for male patients, whereas older patients with group I rare methylation
      signature have a potentially poorer clinical outcome. IMPACT: Methylation of the 
      PCGT genes along with RASSF1A, APC, and MGMT can be potentially used as a new
      biomarker for the classification and prognosis of CRC tumors and independently of
      where the tumor has originated.

PG  - 2101-7
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-0730 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bile acid and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) are important toxic
      factors for gastric mucosal injury. We examined the role of bile acid in
      promoting histologic gastritis and gastric carcinoma in Japanese patients.
      METHODS: A total of 767 patients (452 men, mean age 51.1 years) were studied.
      Gastric juice was collected by gastro-endoscopic examination, and the bile acid
      concentration was examined by enzymatic method. The grade of histologic gastritis
      was evaluated by gastric biopsies, and the relationship between the bile acid
      concentration and the gastritis score was examined. The occurrence of gastric
      cancer was examined by a retrospective cohort study. CDX2/CINC1 expression in
      RGM-1 cells was evaluated by real-time PCR. RESULTS: In H. pylori-positive
      patients, we found significant positive correlation between the bile acid
      concentration and the grades of atrophy/intestinal metaplasia (P < 0.01).
      However, we found significant negative associations between the bile acid
      concentrations and the histologic scores of mononuclear cell/neutrophil
      infiltrations (P < 0.01). Patients with a high concentration of bile acid
      developed gastric cancer more frequently than those with a low concentration (P <
      0.05). Cholic acid treatment significantly increased CDX2 expression in RGM-1
      cells. CINC1 expression in RGM-1 cell was significantly induced by coculture with
      H. pylori, and the induction was reduced by glycochenodeoxycholic acid treatment.
      CONCLUSION: The bile acid in gastric juice contributes to the progression of
      histologic atrophy and intestinal metaplasia without inflammatory cell
      infiltration, followed by carcinogenesis in H. pylori-positive patients. IMPACT: 
      Bile acid promotes intestinal metaplasia and gastric carcinogenesis without
      inflammatory cell infiltration.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Progress continues in our understanding of the role of
      Helicobacter pylori infection in gastroduodenal as well as extragastric
      disorders. This review gives an overview on selected areas of the H. pylori
      infection and their clinical implications. RECENT FINDINGS: Indications for
      therapy have been extended and now include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,
      iron deficiency anemia, and vitamin B12 deficiency. New data are presented on the
      role of H. pylori in neurodegenerative disorders and in the metabolic syndrome.
      H. pylori is associated with a (small) increase in the risk for colorectal
      adenoma and colon cancer. The biggest challenge is the selection of new therapies
      and treatment strategies because of the increasing failure of standard triple
      therapies. The best option in high clarithromycin resistance areas is
      bismuth-based quadruple therapy. Probiotic bacteria and yeasts reduce adverse
      effects of standard H. pylori eradication regimens. In gastric cancer prevention,
      screening programs based on the serological detection of preneoplastic conditions
      may prove useful. SUMMARY: New algorithms for preventing H. pylori-induced
      disease and eradicating the organism should be individualized.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify valproic acid (VPA) analogs with a broad
      spectrum of anti-cancer activities and an increased apoptosis-inducing potential 
      compared with the parent VPA, which is enrolled as histone deacetylase (HDAC)
      inhibitor in a large number of clinical trials. We identified a chiral VPA
      derivative, (S)-2-pentyl-4-pentynoic acid, previously characterized as HDAC
      inhibitor that induced massive programmed cell death in a strongly
      enantioselective manner in U937 histiocytic lymphoma cells and NB4 acute
      promyelocytic leukemia cells. By performing fluorescence-activated cell sorting
      and Western blotting analyses, we established that enantiomer
      (S)-2-pentyl-4-pentynoic acid has higher apoptosis-inducing potential than VPA
      itself. The optic antipode (R)-2-pentyl-4-pentynoic acid and VPA caused under the
      same conditions only a weak growth inhibition without inducing cell
      differentiation and apoptosis. (S)-2-pentyl-4-pentynoic acid is more apoptogenic 
      than VPA and displays enantioselective anti-cancer properties that warrant
      further research regarding the mechanistic basis of its activity and its
      potential use in cancer therapy.

AB  - Limited follow-up data are available on patients with cervical cytology results
      of atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude a high-grade intraepithelial lesion
      (ASC-H), who test negative for high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV). Between
      June 2005 and December 2010, 885 patients were identified with ThinPrep results
      of Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) hrHPV-negative cervical ASC-H liquid-based cytology and
      follow-up histopathology or cytology results extending to September 2011. Of the 
      885 patients with available follow-up results, 549 (62.0%) had at least 1
      histopathologic result during the entire follow-up period, whereas 336 (38.0%)
      had only cytologic follow-up documented. In an average follow-up period of 29
      months, 14 (1.6%) of 885 patients with HPV-negative ASC-H results showed evidence
      of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2/3). No cases of invasive
      cervical cancer were diagnosed. Four of 14 patients with HPV-negative ASC-H
      results with follow-up diagnoses of CIN2/3 had a history of earlier CIN2/3
      diagnoses before HPV-negative ASC-H results. Follow-up of patients with
      HPV-negative ASC-H results using methods specified in this study yielded low
      rates of detectible CIN2/3 and no diagnoses of cervical cancer. Triage of study
      patients with HPV-negative ASC-H results to routine HPV and cytology cotesting at
      1 year was a safe follow-up option.

TI  - Vaginal reconstruction following radical surgery for colorectal malignancies: a
      systematic review of the literature.
PG  - 3933-42
LID - 10.1245/s10434-012-2503-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vaginectomy is frequently indicated to ensure an adequate resection
      in rectal cancer. This paper reviews the success, complications, and functional
      results after various methods of vaginal reconstruction following resection for
      rectal tumors. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed by
      using the MEDLINE database, Embase, and the Cochrane library (1990-2010).
      RESULTS: Eighteen papers were available to review. Fifty percent of all women who
      received a neovagina following vaginectomy returned to sexual activity
      postoperatively. The rectus abdominis myocutaneous (RAM) flap remains the most
      common method of vaginal reconstruction after surgery for colorectal cancer.
      Advantages include low operative morbidity, a wide arc of rotation, and ease of
      harvest. Alternatives to flap reconstruction of the vagina have limited
      indications because of higher morbidity rates. CONCLUSIONS: Preferred techniques 
      for vaginal reconstruction following vaginectomy with colorectal cancer resection
      include RAM flaps for partial posterior vaginal defects and bilateral Gracilis
      myocutaneous flaps for complete vaginal excisions.

TI  - A comparison of clinical and pathologic assessments for the prediction of occult 
      nipple involvement in nipple-sparing mastectomies.
PG  - 128-32
LID - 10.1245/s10434-012-2511-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) for both risk reduction and cancer is
      increasing. In the cancer setting, most studies suggest the use of both clinical 
      and intraoperative biopsy criteria in patient selection. This study examines the 
      use of both biopsy and clinical criteria in women undergoing total
      nipple-removing mastectomy. METHODS: The study consisted of 58 patients
      undergoing total mastectomy without nipple sparing. Biopsies of the subareola
      tissue (SA), proximal nipple (NC) contents and radial sections of the residual
      nipple (NR) were examined microscopically. Tumor size and distance from the
      nipple were also noted. RESULTS: Using clinical criteria alone, the false
      negative rate was 53.8% and a false positive rate of 44.4%. When adding subareola
      and nipple core biopsies to clinical criteria the false negative rate fell to
      7.7% but the false positive rate remained at 44.4%. When using only SA and NC
      biopsies to predict occult nipple involvement, the false negative rate was 11.8%.
      In 4 cases the NC was positive while the SA was negative for cancer and in 6
      cases the SA was positive and NC negative. In 2 cases both the NC and SA biopsies
      were negative while the NR was positive. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports a more 
      limited role in the use of clinical criteria for evaluating patients for NSM.
      This maximizes the number of patients who are candidates for NSM with minimal
      risk of nipple involvement. It was also noted that intraoperative biopsies are
      not totally reliable in predicting occult nipple involvement.

TI  - Effect of prophylactic central compartment neck dissection on serum thyroglobulin
      and recommendations for adjuvant radioactive iodine in patients with
      differentiated thyroid cancer.
PG  - 4217-22
LID - 10.1245/s10434-012-2594-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controversy exists in the management of patients with differentiated 
      thyroid cancer (DTC). The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of
      prophylactic central compartment neck dissection (CCND) on serum thyroglobulin
      (Tg) levels and recommendations for adjuvant radioactive iodine (RAI). METHODS:
      The records of 103 patients who underwent completion/total thyroidectomy for DTC 
      between January 2009 and November 2010 were reviewed. Prophylactic CCND was
      defined as removal of central compartment lymph nodes with no preoperative or
      intraoperative evidence of lymphadenopathy. Institutional protocol included a
      diagnostic whole-body scan before RAI; patients with a negative scan and Tg < 2.0
      did not receive adjuvant RAI. RESULTS: Among the 103 patients, therapeutic CCND
      was performed in 17 (17 %) and prophylactic CCND in 49 (48 %). Of the 49
      patients, 20 (41 %) had positive cervical lymph nodes. Positive lymph nodes
      changed American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor, node, metastasis staging in 17 
      patients and recommendations for RAI in 14. At a median follow-up of 21 months,
      there was no difference in Tg level based on the application of CCND; however, 92
      % of patients with M0 disease had an undetectable Tg. One patient had recurrent
      DTC based on serum Tg only. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic CCND resulted in detection 
      of unsuspected metastatic lymphadenopathy in 20 (41 %) of 49 patients and changed
      RAI recommendations in 14 (33 %). To date, most patients have an undetectable Tg.
      Longer follow-up is needed to detect potential differences in recurrent disease
      based on the use of CCND or long-term effects of RAI.

TI  - Colorectal cancer with synchronous resectable liver metastases: monocentric
      management in a hepatobiliary referral center improves survival outcomes.
PG  - 938-45
LID - 10.1245/s10434-012-2628-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Management of patients with synchronous colorectal liver metastases
      (SCRLM) should be individually tailored. This study compares patients managed by 
      hepatobiliary centers from diagnosis with those referred for liver resection
      (LR). METHODS: Between 1998 and 2010, a total of 284 patients with SCRLM
      underwent resection; 106 resectable patients (1-3 unilobar metastases, diameter
      <100 mm, liver-only disease) were divided into two groups: 66 managed from
      diagnosis (group A) and 40 referred for LR (group B). RESULTS: Group A contained 
      a greater proportion of multiple metastases (55.0 vs. 34.8%, P = 0.042). Group B 
      always received colorectal surgery as up-front treatment (vs. 18.2%, P < 0.0001).
      In group B, chemotherapy before LR was more common (72.5 vs. 33.3%, P = 0.0001)
      and lasted longer (P = 0.010). More patients in group B exhibited disease
      progression before LR (17.5 vs. 3.0%, P = 0.025). Group A underwent fewer
      surgical procedures (80.3% simultaneous resection vs. 0%, P < 0.00001), with
      similar short-term outcomes. After a median follow-up of 42.0 months, group A
      exhibited higher 5 year disease-free survival (DFS, 64.8 vs. 30.8%, P = 0.005)
      and fewer extrahepatic recurrences (21.5 vs. 47.5%, P = 0.005). The late-referral
      group (>6 months, n = 24) had shorter median overall survival (OS) and DFS than
      group A (49.1 and 25.3 months vs. not achieved and not achieved, P < 0.05). The
      early-referral group exhibited OS and DFS similar to group A. Multivariate
      analysis confirmed late referral as a negative predictive factor of OS and DFS.
      CONCLUSIONS: Monocentric management of SCRLM in hepatobiliary centers is
      associated with shorter preoperative chemotherapy, better disease control, fewer 
      surgical procedures (simultaneous resection), and, compared with late-referred
      patients, better survival.

LID - 10.1245/s10434-012-2664-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ACOSOG Z0011 (Z0011) trial concluded that sentinel lymph node
      biopsy (SLNB) without completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) provides
      excellent regional control in women with T1-T2 sentinel lymph node (SLN) positive
      breast cancers receiving breast conservation therapy. We determined whether
      application of Z0011 guidelines would reduce costs. METHODS: A retrospective
      chart review of patients with invasive breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and 
      SLNB at our institution during 2009 was performed. We determined the number of
      overnight hospital admissions following ALND and estimated costs pertaining to
      the perioperative surgical management of the axilla patients actually received,
      and compared those to the estimated number of inpatient days and perioperative
      costs if Z0011 guidelines had been followed for eligible patients. The 2011
      Medicare Fee Schedule was used to estimate costs for procedures, and costs for OR
      time were estimated using procedure length and cost of OR time per minute.
      RESULTS: A total of 71 patients underwent lumpectomy with SLNB and had at least 1
      positive SLN. Estimated costs related to perioperative surgical management of the
      axilla were $322,775, and there were 36 overnight admissions. Applying Z0011
      criteria, 51 patients (72%) would have been eligible to forego completion ALND.
      Estimated costs would have been $264,513 with 13 overnight admissions,
      translating into a cost savings of $58,262 and 23 fewer overnight admissions.
      CONCLUSION: Application of Z0011 guidelines resulted in cost savings, with a 64% 
      reduction in inpatient hospital days and an 18% reduction in early perioperative 
      costs.

      regulatory T cells (Treg) is not well defined. METHODS: TIL in 188 patients who
      underwent CRCLM resection between 1998 and 2000 were analyzed by
      immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays. Correlation between TIL
      composition and outcome was determined while controlling for established
      prognostic factors. Total T cells (CD3), helper T cells (CD4), cytotoxic T cells 
      (CD8), and Treg (FoxP3) were analyzed. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 40
      months for all patients and 95 months for survivors. Overall survival (OS) at 5
      and 10 years was 40 and 25%, respectively. The CD4 T cell count correlated with
      OS (p = .02) and recurrence-free survival (p = .04). A high number of CD8 T cells
      relative to total T cells (CD8:CD3 ratio) predicted longer OS times (p = .05).
      Analysis of Treg revealed that high FoxP3:CD4 (p = .03) and FoxP3:CD8 (p = .05)
      ratios were independent predictors of shorter OS. Patients with a high clinical
      risk score (CRS) were more likely to have a high number of intratumoral Treg, and
      patients >/=65 years old had a less robust CRCLM T cell infiltration.
      CONCLUSIONS: A high number of Treg relative to CD4 or CD8 T cells predicted poor 
      outcome, suggesting an immunosuppressive role for FoxP3 + TIL. The intratumoral
      immune response was an independent predictor of outcome in patients with
      colorectal liver metastases.

TI  - Elevated CEA levels and low distance of the tumor from the anal verge are
      predictors of incomplete response to chemoradiation in patients with rectal
      cancer.
PG  - 864-71
LID - 10.1245/s10434-012-2669-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate pretreatment clinical
      parameters as predictive factors for complete pathological response after
      long-term chemoradiotherapy (RCT) for rectal cancer. Tumor downstaging after RCT 
      for rectal cancer can be obtained in half of cases, whereas a complete
      pathological response (CPR) is reported to range between 15 and 30%. It is not
      possible to foresee before therapies who will respond. METHODS: Patients with
      stage II-III rectal cancer that had undergone RCT and rectal resection between
      January 1995 and October 2010 were considered. Patients were divided in those who
      achieved a CPR, "CR" group, and those who did not achieve a CPR, "NCR" group.
      Univariate and multivariate analyses between groups were performed considering
      the clinical parameters: gender, age, ASA score, preoperative hematic CEA, tumor 
      grading; distance of the tumor from the anal verge, maximum tumor diameter, TNM
      stage, and neoadjuvant treatment details. RESULTS: Among 260 patients, 43 (16.5%)
      achieved a CPR. The two groups resulted homogeneous for age, sex, pretreatment
      status, and tumor stage. A CEA <5 ng/dl and distance from anal verge >5 cm were
      correlated with CPR at multivariate analysis. Patients with both these conditions
      presented a significantly higher CPR rate (30.6%) as well as improved 5-year
      survival. CPR was also correlated with improved survival. CONCLUSIONS: Very low
      tumors with a high serum CEA are very unlikely to reach a CPR. The predictive
      value of these easily available clinical factors should not be underestimated,
      and better therapeutic strategies for these tumors are needed.

TI  - DNA methylation of NDRG2 in gastric cancer and its clinical significance.
PG  - 715-23
LID - 10.1007/s10620-012-2393-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is one of the most common digestive malignancies
      worldwide. N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) is a differentiation-related
      gene that is considered to be a metastasis suppressor gene. In this study, we
      examined the expression and DNA methylation of NDRG2 in gastric cancer cell lines
      and tissues, as well as its clinical significance. METHODS: Six gastric cancer
      cell lines and 42 paired normal and gastric cancer tissue samples were used to
      assess NDRG2 mRNA expression using RT-PCR. NDRG2 DNA methylation status was
      evaluated by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) in gastric cancer cell lines and
      tissues. The suppression of NDRG2 in BGC823 cells by siRNA transfection was
      utilized to detect the role of NDRG2 in gastric cancer progression. RESULTS:
      NDRG2 mRNA was down-regulated in gastric cancer cell lines and tissues, and its
      expression was just related to lymph node metastasis (p = 0.032). MSP showed
      methylation of NDRG2 in 54.0 % (47/87) of primary gastric cancer specimens and in
      20.0 % (16/80) of corresponding nonmalignant gastric tissues. NDRG2 methylation
      was related to depth of tumor invasion, Borrmann classification and TNM stage (p 
      < 0.05). Upon treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A, NDRG2
      expression was upregulated in HGC27 cells, and demethylation of the highly
      metastatic cell line, MKN45, inhibited cell invasion. Furthermore, the
      suppression of NDRG2 by siRNA transfection enhanced BGC823 cells invasion.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the aberrant methylation of NDRG2 may be
      mainly responsible for its downregulation in gastric cancer, and may play an
      important role in the metastasis of gastric cancer.

TI  - Displaying 3D radiation dose on endoscopic video for therapeutic assessment and

PG  - 6601-14
LID - 10.1088/0031-9155/57/20/6601 [doi]
AB  - We have developed a method to register and display 3D parametric data, in
      particular radiation dose, on two-dimensional endoscopic images. This
      registration of radiation dose to endoscopic or optical imaging may be valuable
      in assessment of normal tissue response to radiation, and visualization of
      radiated tissues in patients receiving post-radiation surgery. Electromagnetic
      sensors embedded in a flexible endoscope were used to track the position and
      orientation of the endoscope allowing registration of 2D endoscopic images to CT 
      volumetric images and radiation doses planned with respect to these images. A
      surface was rendered from the CT image based on the air/tissue threshold,
      creating a virtual endoscopic view analogous to the real endoscopic view.
      Radiation dose at the surface or at known depth below the surface was assigned to
      each segment of the virtual surface. Dose could be displayed as either a
      colorwash on this surface or surface isodose lines. By assigning transparency
      levels to each surface segment based on dose or isoline location, the virtual
      dose display was overlaid onto the real endoscope image. Spatial accuracy of the 
      dose display was tested using a cylindrical phantom with a treatment plan created
      for the phantom that matched dose levels with grid lines on the phantom surface. 
      The accuracy of the dose display in these phantoms was 0.8-0.99 mm. To
      demonstrate clinical feasibility of this approach, the dose display was also
      tested on clinical data of a patient with laryngeal cancer treated with radiation
      therapy, with estimated display accuracy of approximately 2-3 mm. The utility of 
      the dose display for registration of radiation dose information to the surgical
      field was further demonstrated in a mock sarcoma case using a leg phantom. With
      direct overlay of radiation dose on endoscopic imaging, tissue toxicities and
      tumor response in endoluminal organs can be directly correlated with the actual
      tissue dose, offering a more nuanced assessment of normal tissue toxicities
      following radiation therapy and accurate registration of radiation dose to the
      surgical field.

AB  - We describe a novel multicomponent graphene nanostructured system that is
      biocompatible, and has strong NIR optical absorbance and superparamagnetic
      properties. The fabrication of the multicomponent nanostructure system involves
      the covalent attachment of 3 components; Fe(3)O(4)(Fe) nanoparticles,
      PAMAM-G4-NH(2) (G4) dendrimer and Cy5 (Cy) on a graphene oxide (GO) surface to
      synthesize a biologically relevant multifunctional system. The resultant
      GO-G4-Fe-Cy nanosystem exhibits high dispersion in an aqueous medium, and is
      magnetically responsive and fluorescent. In vitro experiments provide a clear
      indication of successful uptake of the GO-G4-Fe-Cy nanosystem by MCF-7 breast
      cancer cells, and it is seen to behave as a bright and stable fluorescent marker.
      The study also reveals varied cellular distribution kinetics profile for the GO
      nanostructured system compared to free Cy. Furthermore, the newly developed GO
      nanostructured system is observed to be non-toxic to MDA-MB-231 cell growth, in
      striking contrast to free G4 dendrimer and GO-G4 conjugate. The GO-G4-Fe-Cy
      nanostructured system characterized by multifunctionality suggests the merits of 
      graphene for cellular bioimaging and the delivery of bioactives.

TI  - Phase II study of irinotecan and cisplatin with concurrent split-course
      radiotherapy in limited-disease small cell lung cancer.
PG  - 645-51
LID - 10.1007/s00280-012-1952-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irinotecan and cisplatin are one of active regimens for patients with
      extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). To determine the efficacy and
      toxicity of irinotecan and cisplatin with concurrent split-course thoracic
      radiotherapy in limited-disease (LD) SCLC, we conducted a phase II study.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients fulfilling the following eligibility
      criteria were enrolled: chemotherapy-naive, good performance status (PS 0-1), age
      </=75, LD-SCLC, and adequate organ function. The patients received irinotecan 40 
      mg/m(2) i.v. on days 1, 8, and 15, and cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) i.v. on day 1. Four
      cycles of chemotherapy were repeated every 4 weeks. Split-course thoracic
      radiotherapy of once-daily 2 Gy/day commenced on day 2 of each chemotherapy
      cycle, with 26 and 24 Gy administered in the first and second cycles,
      respectively. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were eligible and assessable for
      response, toxicity, and survival. Patients' characteristics were as follows:
      male/female = 29/5; PS 0/1 = 18/16; median age (range) = 67 (50-73); and stage
      IB/IIA/IIB/IIIA/IIIB = 2/2/3/16/11. The overall response was 100 % (CR 8, PR 26).
      Grade 4 leukopenia, neutropenia, grade 3-5 pneumonitis, diarrhea, and esophagitis
      occurred in 24, 38, 6, 3, and 0 %, respectively. There were 2 treatment-related
      deaths from pneumonitis. The median time to tumor progression was 14.3 months.
      The median overall survival time and the 2- and 5-year survival rates were 44.5
      months, 66.7 and 46.1 %, respectively. No tumor progression was observed in
      patients with CR. CONCLUSION: Irinotecan plus cisplatin with concurrent
      split-course thoracic radiotherapy was effective and tolerable in untreated
      LD-SCLC.

TI  - NLRP3 promotes inflammation-induced skin cancer but is dispensable for
      asbestos-induced mesothelioma.
PG  - 983-6
LID - 10.1038/icb.2012.46 [doi]
AB  - Asbestos exposure can result in serious and frequently lethal diseases, including
      malignant mesothelioma. The host sensor for asbestos-induced inflammation is the 
      NLRP3 inflammasome and it is widely assumed that this complex is essential for
      asbestos-induced cancers. Here, we report that acute interleukin-1beta production
      and recruitment of immune cells into peritoneal cavity were significantly
      decreased in the NLRP3-deficient mice after the administration of asbestos.
      However, NLRP3-deficient mice displayed a similar incidence of malignant
      mesothelioma and survival times as wild-type mice. Thus, early inflammatory
      reactions triggered by asbestos are NLRP3-dependent, but NLRP3 is not critical in
      the chronic development of asbestos-induced mesothelioma. Notably, in a two-stage
      carcinogenesis-induced papilloma model, NLRP3-deficient mice showed a resistance 
      phenotype in two different strain backgrounds, suggesting a tumour-promoting role
      of NLRP3 in certain chemically-induced cancer types.

TI  - Hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic hepatitis C: from bench to bedside.
PG  - 111-20
LID - 10.1007/s00281-012-0330-z [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in men and seventh
      in women, accounting for 7 % of all cancers, and the third cause of
      cancer-related death worldwide. Nearly 90 to 95 % of all HCC occur in the context
      of known and often preventable risk factors, such as chronic viral hepatitis,
      alcohol abuse, and metabolic disorders. Although several experimental lines of
      research support a direct role for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in cancer promotion,
      cirrhosis is the main risk factor for this tumor, whereas other factors like
      alcohol and tobacco smoking are clearly able to accelerate HCC development. For
      this reason, cirrhotic patients with chronic HCV infection are subjected to
      abdominal ultrasound surveillance every 6 months, aimed at an early diagnosis of 
      HCC to allow curative treatment options. Current strategies to positively impact 
      on HCC incidence rates in HCV patients include prevention of cirrhosis
      development by avoiding metabolic, pharmacological, or social factors associated 
      with accelerated progression of liver disease, or through virus eradication by
      interferon-based treatments. Moreover, a successful antiviral treatment has the
      added benefit of positively impacting on the rate of HCC development also in
      patients who are already cirrhotic.

TI  - Statins and primary liver cancer: a meta-analysis of observational studies.
PG  - 229-34
LID - 10.1097/CEJ.0b013e328358761a [doi]
AB  - Statins are among the most commonly prescribed drugs used to manage dyslipidemia.
      Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third leading cause of cancer mortality and its
      rates have recently been increasing in central and northern Europe and USA. To
      quantify the association between statin use and risk for HCC, we performed a
      meta-analysis of published studies. We conducted a MEDLINE search for
      observational studies reporting the association between exposure to statins and
      risk for incident liver cancer until March 2012. Fixed-effect and random-effect
      models were used to estimate summary relative risks (RR) and the corresponding
      95% confidence intervals (CIs). Moreover, between-study heterogeneity and
      publication bias were assessed using adequate statistical tests. Five
      observational studies (two case-control and three cohort studies) based on 2574
      cases of HCC were included. Statin treatment, compared with no treatment, was
      inversely related to HCC (summary RR=0.58; 95% CI 0.46-0.74). Between-study
      heterogeneity was significant (P<0.001) and numerically relevant (I=65%). When
      only longest statin use was considered, the RR was 0.66 (95% CI 0.55-0.80).
      Influence analysis on the overall estimate showed that heterogeneity was largely 
      because of one study; when omitting it, the I dropped to 27% (P=0.240), whereas
      the summary RR was only marginally modified (RR=0.52; 95% CI 0.44-0.62). There
      was no evidence of publication bias. This meta-analysis suggests a favorable
      effect of statins on HCC, in the absence, however, of a duration-risk
      relationship.

TI  - Lipoprotein(a) plasma levels and the risk of cancer: the PRIME study.
PG  - 286-93
LID - 10.1097/CEJ.0b013e328359cba7 [doi]
AB  - Although experimental studies have shown lipoprotein(a) antiangiogenic and
      antitumoral effects, the association of lipoprotein(a) levels with cancer in
      population studies remains elusive and poorly documented. The aim of this study
      was to analyse the relationship between lipoprotein(a) plasma levels and the
      incidence of cancer over 10 years of follow-up. Data from two French centres of
      the PRIME cohort were used, representing 5237 men aged 50-59 years and free from 
      a history of cancer at baseline. Data on medical history, socioeconomic and
      lifestyle factors were obtained by questionnaire. Lipoprotein(a) plasma levels
      were analysed from fasting blood samples collected at baseline. The relationship 
      between lipoprotein(a) levels and first incident cancer was studied using the
      multivariate Cox proportional hazards models for all-site and the
      main-site-specific cancers, adjusted for various potential confounders including 
      age, centre, smoking status and alcohol consumption. During follow-up, 456 new
      cancers were identified. No significant association was found between
      lipoprotein(a) and the all-site or main-site-specific cancers (hazard ratios for 
      quartiles 2-4 vs. 1, respectively: 1.24, 1.11, 1.29, P=0.23). However, a higher
      risk seemed to be observed for highest lipoprotein(a) levels in all sites, lung, 
      colorectal or tobacco/alcohol-related cancers. For prostate cancer, the lowest
      risk was observed for the highest levels of lipoprotein(a) (P=0.12). In
      conclusion, no evident association was found between the lipoprotein(a) levels
      and the incidence of cancer. Nevertheless, a higher cancer risk seemed to be
      observed for the highest lipoprotein(a) levels. Further research focusing on the 
      lipoprotein(a) qualitative structure, that is, apolipoprotein(a) polymorphism
      could help clarify this highly complex relation.

TI  - How people construct their experience of living with secondary lymphoedema in the
      context of their everyday lives in Australia.
PG  - 459-66
LID - 10.1007/s00520-012-1534-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to explore how men and women construct
      their experiences living with lymphoedema following treatment for any cancer in
      the context of everyday life. METHODS: The design and conduct of this qualitative
      study was guided by Charmaz' social constructivist grounded theory. To collect
      data, focus groups and telephone interviews were conducted. Audiotapes were
      transcribed verbatim and imported into NVivo8 to organize data and codes. Data
      were analyzed using key grounded theory principles of constant comparison, data
      saturation, and initial, focused, and theoretical coding. RESULTS: Participants
      were 3 men and 26 women who had developed upper- or lower-limb lymphoedema
      following cancer treatment. Three conceptual categories were developed during
      data analysis and were labeled "accidental journey," "altered normalcy," and "ebb
      and flow of control." "Altered normalcy" reflects the physical and psychosocial
      consequences of lymphoedema and its relationship to everyday life. "Accidental
      journey" explains the participants' experiences with the health care system,
      including the prevention, treatment, and management of their lymphoedema. "Ebb
      and flow of control" draws upon a range of individual and social elements that
      influenced the participants' perceived control over lymphoedema. These conceptual
      categories were interrelated and contributed to the core category of "sense of
      self," which describes their perceptions of their identity and roles.
      CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the need for greater clinical and public awareness
      of lymphoedema as a chronic condition requiring prevention and treatment, and one
      that has far-reaching effects on physical and psychosocial well-being as well as 
      overall quality of life.

TI  - Symptom clusters and symptom interference of HCC patients undergoing TACE: a
      cross-sectional study in China.
PG  - 475-83
LID - 10.1007/s00520-012-1541-5 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the symptom and symptom
      clusters of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) before and after
      transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), and to discuss the relationship 
      between symptoms, symptom clusters, and symptom interference. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Patients with HCC who received TACE were asked to rate their symptoms
      using the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory and the symptom checklist particularly
      for HCC. To determine the interrelationships among symptoms and identify the
      symptom clusters, a principal component analysis with varimax rotation was
      carried out on the symptom items. Spearman correlation analysis was done to
      assess the relationship between symptom clusters and symptom interference.
      RESULTS: A total of 155 patients finished the whole procedure between November
      2010 and May 2011. Before TACE, the five most severe symptoms, ranked in order,
      were fatigue (3.40 +/- 2.26), distress (3.35 +/- 2.60), sadness (3.01 +/- 2.66), 
      sleep disturbance (2.63 +/- 2.57), and lack of appetite (2.26 +/- 2.38). After
      TACE, fatigue (4.88 +/- 2.31) was the most serious symptom, followed by sleep
      disturbance (4.80 +/- 2.25), distress (4.59 +/- 2.32), sadness (4.45 +/- 2.16),
      lack of appetite (4.25 +/- 2.51). Two symptom clusters were found before TACE:
      psychological symptom cluster and sickness symptom cluster. Two new symptom
      clusters were found after TACE: upper gastrointestinal symptom cluster and liver 
      function impairment symptom cluster, with the two original symptom clusters
      remained relatively stable. The highest symptom interference items pre- and
      post-TACE were work and enjoyment of life, followed by mood. The symptoms of
      distress, sadness, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and lack of appetite were all
      significantly associated with the total interference (r = 0.443-0.615, p < 0.01
      or p < 0.05). Symptom clusters were significantly correlated with the total
      symptom interference before and after TACE (r = 0.176-0.638, p < 0.01 or p <
      0.05). CONCLUSION: Psychological symptom cluster and sickness symptom cluster are
      common for HCC patients before and after TACE. Liver function impairment and
      upper gastrointestinal symptom clusters are directly related to TACE treatment.
      Both the symptoms and symptom clusters have significant interference on the daily
      life of HCC patients undergoing TACE. However, more work is needed to further
      clarify the symptom clusters associated with TACE and to test the effectiveness
      of TACE in easing symptoms and improving quality of life of HCC patients.

TI  - Continuous enteral administration can overcome the limited capacity to absorb
      glucose in rats with methotrexate-induced gastrointestinal mucositis.
PG  - 863-71

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal mucositis often
      suffer from weight loss. It is not well known how to enterally feed mucositis
      patients, potentially experiencing malabsorption. Recently, we showed in a rat
      model of methotrexate (MTX)-induced mucositis that intestinal absorption of
      glucose in trace amounts is still intact. We now determined the quantitative
      capacity to absorb glucose in rats with mucositis, relative to controls. METHODS:
      We administered a physiologically relevant amount of [1-(13)C]glucose-enriched
      glucose (meal size) as a bolus by oral gavage (2 g/kg once) or continuously by
      intraduodenal infusion (+/-1.9 g/(kg.h) for 5 h) to rats with MTX-induced
      mucositis and controls. Blood [1-(13)C]glucose concentrations were determined
      during the experimental period. To calculate the quantitative absorptive
      capacity, Steele's one-compartment model, including simultaneous intravenous
      infusion of [6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose, was used. After the experiment, jejunal
      histology and plasma citrulline concentrations were assessed. RESULTS:
      MTX-induced mucositis was confirmed by a reduction in villus length and plasma
      citrulline (both -57%, relative to controls, P < 0.01). When glucose was
      administered as a bolus, MTX-treated rats only absorbed 15% of administered
      glucose, compared with 85% in controls (medians, P < 0.01). Upon continuous
      intraduodenal glucose infusion, the median absorptive capacity for glucose in
      MTX-treated rats did not differ from controls (80 versus 93% of administered
      glucose respectively, P = 0.06). However, glucose absorption differed
      substantially between individual MTX-treated rats (range, 21-95%), which
      correlated poorly with villus length (rho = 0.54, P = 0.030) and plasma
      citrulline (rho = 0.56, P = 0.024). CONCLUSION: Continuous enteral administration
      can almost completely overcome the reduced absorptive capacity for glucose in
      rats with mucositis.

AB  - We report a facile approach to forming dendrimer-stabilized gold nanoparticles
      (Au DSNPs) through the use of amine-terminated fifth-generation poly(amidoamine) 
      (PAMAM) dendrimers modified by diatrizoic acid (G5.NH(2)-DTA) as stabilizers for 
      enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging applications. In this study, by simply 
      mixing G5.NH(2)-DTA dendrimers with gold salt in aqueous solution at room
      temperature, dendrimer-entrapped gold nanoparticles (Au DENPs) with a mean core
      size of 2.5 nm were able to be spontaneously formed. Followed by an acetylation
      reaction to neutralize the dendrimer remaining terminal amines, Au DSNPs with a
      mean size of 6 nm were formed. The formed DTA-containing
      [(Au(0))(50)-G5.NHAc-DTA] DSNPs were characterized via different techniques. We
      show that the Au DSNPs are colloid stable in aqueous solution under different pH 
      and temperature conditions. In vitro hemolytic assay, cytotoxicity assay, flow
      cytometry analysis, and cell morphology observation reveal that the formed Au
      DSNPs have good hemocompatibility and are non-cytotoxic at a concentration up to 
      3.0 muM. X-ray absorption coefficient measurements show that the DTA-containing
      Au DSNPs have enhanced attenuation intensity, much higher than that of
      [(Au(0))(50)-G5.NHAc] DENPs without DTA or Omnipaque at the same molar
      concentration of the active element (Au or iodine). The formed DTA-containing Au 
      DSNPs can be used for CT imaging of cancer cells in vitro as well as for blood
      pool CT imaging of mice in vivo with significantly improved signal enhancement.
      With the two radiodense elements of Au and iodine incorporated within one
      particle, the formed DTA-containing Au DSNPs may be applicable for CT imaging of 
      various biological systems with enhanced X-ray attenuation property and detection
      sensitivity.

PG  - 223-33
LID - 10.1007/s00534-012-0531-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The discovery of practical biomarkers is important to realize
      personalized medicine for patients with malignant neoplasias, including
      colorectal cancer (CRC). PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine reliable
      prognostic biomarkers by the analysis of patients with resectable colorectal
      liver metastases (CRLM). METHODS: Genomic DNA was obtained from the CRLM tissues 
      of a cohort of 126 patients with CRLM with curative hepatic resection. The
      KRAS/BRAF mutation spectrum and microsatellite instability (MSI) status were
      successfully analyzed in 100 of the 126 CRLM tissues and these findings were
      examined in relation to the patients' clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The cohort of
      100 CRLM patients consisted of 46 with synchronous and 54 with metachronous liver
      metastasis. Overall survival and disease-free survival at 5 years were 57.4 and
      24.9 %, respectively. MSI analysis revealed that none of the 100 CRLM specimens
      showed any evidence of MSI. By KRAS/BRAF mutation analysis, the analyzed CRLM
      patients were divided into 3 groups; KRAS-mutant (KRAS-Mt; n = 27), BRAF-mutant
      (BRAF-Mt; n = 3), and wild-types of both genes (Wild-type; n = 70). In the
      survival analysis, both KRAS-Mt and BRAF-Mt patients showed significantly poorer 
      prognoses compared with Wild-type patients. Furthermore, although the population 
      with the BRAF mutation was small, this mutation had a significant negative impact
      on disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, all tumors in the cohort of
      CRLM patients were non-MSI tumors, suggesting MSI cancer in primary CRC would
      rarely reveal metastatic potential. KRAS and BRAF mutations are suggested to be
      poor prognostic factors in CRLM. Genetic information has an essential role as a
      prognostic marker and could contribute to the decisions on treatment strategy for
      CRLM.

PG  - 587-93
LID - 10.1007/s00534-012-0544-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The liver is an essential organ that maintains vital activity through
      its numerous important functions. It has a unique capability of fully
      regenerating after injury. Regulating a balance between self-renewal and
      differentiation of hepatic stem cells that are resources for functional mature
      liver cells is required for maintenance of tissue homeostasis. METHODS: This
      review describes the characteristics of hepatic stem/progenitor cells and the
      regulatory mechanism of their self-renewal and differentiation capacity. RESULTS:
      In liver organogenesis, undifferentiated hepatic stem/progenitor cells expand
      their pool by repeated self-renewal in the early stage of liver development and
      then differentiate into two different types of cell lineage, namely hepatocytes
      and cholangiocytes. Liver development is regulated by expression of stem cell
      transcription factors in a complex multistep process. Recent studies suggest that
      stem cells are maintained by integrative regulation of gene expression patterns
      related to self-renewal and differentiation by epigenetic mechanisms such as
      histone modification and DNA methylation. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the proper
      regulatory mechanism of hepatic stem/progenitor cells is important for
      regenerative medicine that utilizes hepatic stem cells and for preventing liver
      cancer through clarification of the carcinogenetic mechanism involved in stem
      cell system failure.

      therapies and the risks associated with unlicensed medicines.
PG  - 1563-71
LID - 10.1007/s00417-012-2123-4 [doi]
AB  - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor medications such as
      ranibizumab, pegaptanib and bevacizumab are in use for the treatment of
      neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and other retinal conditions, 
      although only ranibizumab and pegaptanib are approved for these conditions. In
      contrast, bevacizumab was developed for the intravenous systemic treatment of
      colorectal cancer and is not formulated for intravitreal use, but is commonly
      used off-label in ophthalmology. European Union legislation permits the use of
      drugs outside the terms of their licence ('off-label') only under certain
      circumstances, such as during clinical trials, compassionate/named patient use in
      the absence of a licensed alternative, emergency scenarios (e.g., pandemics) or
      at the discretion of a treating physician. In such cases, patients should be
      fully informed regarding their treatment and any potential risks involved.
      Off-label drug use can be an important tool to provide patients with treatment in
      cases of unmet medical need. However, the use of an unlicensed medicinal product,
      when a suitable licensed alternative is available, puts prescribing physicians at
      risk of liability if safety issues arise. Emerging clinical evidence suggests
      safety differences exist between ranibizumab and bevacizumab.

TI  - Combretastatin A-4 derivatives: synthesis and evaluation of
      2,4,5-triaryl-1H-imidazoles as potential agents against H1299 (non-small cell
      lung cancer cell).
PG  - 697-709
LID - 10.1007/s11030-012-9396-8 [doi]
AB  - A number of 2,4,5-triaryl-1H-imidazole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated
      for their antiproliferative activities against the growth of five cell lines
      including three non-small cell lung cancers (H460, H1299, and A549), one breast
      cancer (MCF-7), and one normal diploid embryonic lung cell line (MRC-5).
      Preliminary results indicated that both
      2-(5-bromofuran-2-yl)-4,5-bis{4-[3-(dimethylamino) propoxy] phenyl}-1H-imidazole 
      (10f) and 4,5-bis{4-[3-(dimethylamino)propoxy]phenyl}-2-(5-nitrofuran-2-yl)-1H
      -imidazole (10g) were selectively active against the growth of H1229 with an
      IC(50) of less than 0.1 muM, thus were more active than topotecan (IC(50) > 10.0 
      mu M). However, both 10f and 10g exhibited only marginal cytotoxicity against
      H460, A549, MCF-7, and MRC-5 requiring an IC (50) of at least 4.16 muM. Our
      results also indicated that 10f induced H1299 cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 through 
      the inactivation of p38 MAPK, JNK, ERK, as well as the expression of SIRT1 and
      survivin. These results suggested that 10f might have therapeutic potential
      against H1299 (non-small cell lung cancer cell).

PG  - 253-7

AB  - The definition of Barrett esophagus is currently under discussion. It is now
      suggested that a distal esophagus coated with cylinder epithelium with
      cardia-fundus mucosa should also be classified as Barrett esophagus because the
      risk of cancer is significantly increased even without histological evidence of
      intestinal metaplasia with goblet cells. The results of recent epidemiological
      investigations imply that the cancer risk of cylinder cell metaplasia and low
      grade intraepithelial neoplasia in Barrett esophagus has previously been
      overestimated. The histological detection of dysplasia still remains the best
      biomarker for estimation of the risk of cancer of Barrett esophagus. Exact
      determination of invasion depth in the mucosa, respective submucosa is now
      established as prognostic marker for overall survival in Patients with early
      carcinomas and this classification is useful for therapy decisions (endoscopic
      versus surgical removal). In advanced Barrett carcinoma following neoadjuvant
      therapy the lymph node status (ypN) is a better prognostic factor than the ypT
      category. In metastasized tumors therapies targeting HER2/new, EGFR or c-Met have
      been investigated explicitly in Barrett carcinoma only in phase I/II studies,
      whereby the predictive value of appropriate molecular pathology investigations is
      not yet reliably established.

AB  - During tumorigenesis cancer cells acquire certain features allowing for sustained
      growth and circumvention of programmed cell death. For decades cancer research
      has been focused on the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis and how to overcome
      apoptosis resistance in tumor cells. Meanwhile, novel types of programmed cell
      death have turned out to be important for both physiological and pathological
      processes. Recent findings imply that induction of alternative forms of
      programmed cell death, such as necroptosis, might be used as a therapeutic
      approach to overcome therapy resistance in cancer.

TI  - Reducing mitochondrial ROS improves disease-related pathology in a mouse model of
      ataxia-telangiectasia.
PG  - 42-8
LID - 10.1038/mt.2012.203 [doi]
AB  - The disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) has no cure and few treatment options. It
      is caused by mutations in the ATM kinase, which functions in the DNA-damage
      response and redox sensing. In addition to severe cerebellar degeneration, A-T
      pathology includes cancer predisposition, sterility, immune system dysfunction,
      and bone marrow abnormalities. These latter phenotypes are recapitulated in the
      ATM null (ATM(-/-)) mouse model of the disease. Since oxidative stress and
      mitochondrial dysfunction are implicated in A-T, we determined whether reducing
      mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) via overexpression of catalase
      targeted to mitochondria (mCAT) alleviates A-T-related pathology in ATM(-/-)
      mice. We found that mCAT has many beneficial effects in this context, including
      reduced propensity to develop thymic lymphoma, improved bone marrow hematopoiesis
      and macrophage differentiation in vitro, and partial rescue of memory T-cell
      developmental defects. Our results suggest that positive effects observed on
      cancer development may be linked to mCAT reducing mitochondrial ROS, lactate
      production, and TORC1 signaling in transforming double-positive cells, whereas
      beneficial effects in memory T cells appear to be TORC1-independent. Altogether, 
      this study provides proof-of-principle that reducing mitochondrial ROS production
      per se may be therapeutic for the disease, which may have advantages compared
      with more general antioxidant strategies.

TI  - Serrated polyposis: prospective study of first-degree relatives.
PG  - 28-32
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0b013e3283598506 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Serrated polyposis (SP) is an infrequent colorectal cancer (CRC)
      predisposition syndrome. An unidentified genetic defect is believed to play a
      role in this condition. The risk of SP and/or CRC for first-degree relatives
      (FDRs) is not yet well known. The aim of our study was to determine the incidence
      of both SP and/or CRC by studying the FDRs of our index SP cases and to propose
      an appropriate interval for colonoscopy surveillance in this group. METHODS: From
      2005 to December 2011, we prospectively included all patients from our hospital
      who fulfilled the SP diagnostic criteria. We interviewed FDRs face to face and
      offered a colonoscopy to those who were 35 years old or older. The study was
      carried out with conventional and high-definition colonoscopes and
      chromoendoscopy with indigo carmine at the discretion of a single endoscopist.
      The samples were assessed by two pathologists. We reviewed the clinical data for 
      CRC diagnosed previously in FDRs. RESULTS: From 2005, we collected all the new
      cases of SP and offered a colonoscopy to 95 FDRs of 34 pedigrees. We performed
      colonoscopies on 78 FDRs (82.1%). The incidence of SP in the FDRs was 32% (25
      patients). Seventy-six percent of patients were diagnosed with SP as they had any
      number of serrated polyps proximal to the sigmoid colon. Only one patient was
      diagnosed with CRC as a result of the screening colonoscopy. 44.1% of our index
      cases had an FDR with a diagnosis of CRC. CONCLUSION: Our series, which is the
      largest prospective cohort of FDRs published, reports an elevated incidence of SP
      in FDRs, thus supporting the need for screening colonoscopy in FDR and its
      inclusion in the guidelines.

TI  - Postreferral colonoscopy delays in diagnosis of colorectal cancer: a
      mixed-methods analysis.
PG  - 252-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: Delays in diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) are one of the most
      common reasons for malpractice claims and lead to poor outcomes. However, they
      are not well studied. AIMS: We used a mixed quantitative-qualitative approach to 
      analyze postreferral colonoscopy delays in CRC patients and explored referring
      physician's perception of processes surrounding these delays. METHODS: Two
      physician-raters conducted independent electronic health record reviews of new
      CRC cases in a large integrated safety-net system to determine postreferral
      colonoscopy delays, which we defined as failures to perform colonoscopy within 60
      days of referral for an established indication(s). To explore perceptions of
      colonoscopy processes, we conducted semistructured interviews with a sample of
      primary care physicians (PCPs) and used a content analysis approach. RESULTS: Of 
      104 CRC cases that met inclusion criteria, reviewers agreed on the presence of
      postreferral colonoscopy delays in 35 (33.7%) cases; kappa = 0.99 (95% CI,
      0.83-0.99). The median time between first referral and completion of colonoscopy 
      was 123.0 days (range 62.0-938.0; interquartile range = 90.0 days). In about
      two-thirds of instances (64.8%), the reason for delay was a delayed future
      appointment with the gastroenterology service. On interviews, PCPs attributed
      long delays in scheduling to reduced endoscopic capacity and inefficient
      processes related to colonoscopy referral and scheduling, including considerable 
      ambiguity regarding referral guidelines. Many suggested that navigation models be
      applied to streamline CRC diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Postreferral delays in CRC
      diagnosis are potentially preventable. A comprehensive mixed-methods methodology 
      might be useful for others to identify the steps in the diagnostic process that
      are in most need for improvement.

TI  - A phase II study of lapatinib for brain metastases in patients with
      HER2-overexpressing breast cancer following trastuzumab based systemic therapy
      and cranial radiotherapy: subset analysis of Japanese patients.
PG  - 621-8
LID - 10.1007/s10147-012-0444-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is known that one third of patients with human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer (MBC) treated
      with trastuzumab will develop brain metastases. As the development of brain
      metastases is fatal, controlling its progression is clinically meaningful.
      However, effective therapy for MBC patients with brain metastasis after cranial
      radiation is limited. The international clinical study in which six Japanese
      patients participated indicated the antitumor activity of lapatinib against brain
      metastases of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. METHODS: The efficacy, safety,
      and pharmacokinetics of lapatinib 750 mg given twice daily to Japanese
      HER2-overexpressing MBC patients with brain metastases were assessed as part of
      the international clinical study. RESULTS: Of six Japanese patients treated in
      this study, two patients had shown volumetric reduction >20 % in their central
      nervous system (CNS), one of whom had >50 % reduction. Three patients, including 
      two of these patients, had shown >20 % volumetric reduction in non-CNS lesions.
      Frequently reported adverse events were diarrhea and rash, all of which were
      controllable. The AUC0-12 of lapatinib on day 28 was 1.74 times higher than that 
      on day 1. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that lapatinib monotherapy 750 mg
      given twice daily can exert some efficacy and has potential as a clinically
      meaningful treatment option for Japanese HER2-overexpressing breast cancer
      patients with brain metastases after cranial radiation.

TI  - Efficacies and safety of neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus carboplatin followed by
      immediate cystectomy in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer, including
      those unfit for cisplatin: a prospective single-arm study.
PG  - 724-30
LID - 10.1007/s10147-012-0447-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy for patients with
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer (BC) has better survival benefit than radical
      cystectomy (RC) alone. However, optimal dosing schedule, including drug
      selection, number of cycles, and interval between chemotherapy and cystectomy, as
      well as acceptable regimens remain to be established. We conducted a single-arm
      prospective study to evaluate efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus
      carboplatin (GCarbo) chemotherapy followed by immediate RC in patients with
      muscle-invasive BC, including cisplatin-unfit patients. METHODS: Between March
      2005 and June 2011, we enrolled 116 patients with histologically proven
      muscle-invasive BC, including 44 % of the patients who were identified as
      cisplatin-unfit. All participants received two courses of GCarbo therapy,
      gemcitabine 800 mg/m(2) administered on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin with an
      area under the curve of four (AUC 4) administered on day 2. RC and bilateral
      pelvic lymphadenectomy were performed approximately within a month after
      cessation of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was pT0 in the cystectomy
      specimen. Secondary endpoints were overall response rate, overall (OS) and
      disease-free survival (DFS), and toxicity. Survival after cystectomy was analyzed
      using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The RC specimens of 28 (24.1 %) patients 
      showed pT0. At a median follow-up period of 41 months, the OS and DFS rates were 
      89.7 and 86.3 %, respectively. No patients had grade 3/4 gastrointestinal
      toxicity or renal impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant GCarbo therapy followed by
      immediate RC is safe, even in cisplatin-unfit patients, and provides a favorable 
      pathological cancer-free state. The single-arm single-institution study design
      and relatively short observation period were limitations of this study.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of sequential chemotherapy with carboplatin plus gemcitabine 
      followed by weekly paclitaxel in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
PG  - 988-96
LID - 10.1007/s10147-012-0476-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improving survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will require
      new strategies or new drugs. Sequential administration of conventional
      non-cross-resistant cytotoxic drugs offers an opportunity to increase drug
      diversity while maintaining dose intensity. This Phase II trial was designed to
      assess the efficacy and feasibility of such a regimen in advanced NSCLC. METHODS:
      Patients with NSCLC stage IIIB or IV received as first-line treatment four cycles
      of carboplatin (AUC 5) (day 1) plus gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) (days 1 and 8) every
      3 weeks. Thereafter, treatment continued with 12 weekly cycles of paclitaxel 80
      mg/m(2). RESULTS: In total, 46 patients were included. Median age was 59.6 years 
      (range 41.3-74.3 years) and 93.5 % (n = 43) had Eastern Cooperative Oncology
      Group performance score of 0 or 1. All but 6 had stage IV disease, and 13 (28.3
      %) had squamous cell carcinomas. Thirty-six (78 %) patients completed 4 cycles of
      carboplatin-gemcitabine and 35 patients received at least 1 cycle of paclitaxel, 
      of whom 16 (46 % of total) patients completed 12 cycles of paclitaxel. The
      overall objective response rate was 49 %. Sixteen (37 %) patients had a response 
      to carboplatin-gemcitabine, increasing to 21 (49 %) patients after administration
      of paclitaxel. Of the 13 assessable patients who showed a partial response (PR)
      on carboplatin-gemcitabine, 12 (92 %) patients showed also a PR on paclitaxel. Of
      19 assessable patients with stable disease (SD) on carboplatin-gemcitabine, 4 (21
      %) had a PR and 13 (68 %) SD on paclitaxel. Toxicity was moderate: 24 % stopped
      because of toxicity. CONCLUSION: Sequential chemotherapy with
      carboplatin-gemcitabine and weekly paclitaxel is active and feasible in advanced 
      NSCLC patients.

      metastatic colorectal cancer patients.
PG  - 1020-4
LID - 10.1007/s10147-012-0478-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab, a humanized anti-vascular endothelial growth factor
      monoclonal antibody, has showed clinical benefits in patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer. Periodontitis has been observed infrequently in
      bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy in clinical practice. The purpose of this
      study was to retrospectively investigate bevacizumab-related periodontitis in
      metastatic colorectal cancer patients. METHODS: From January 2008 to March 2010, 
      274 patients received bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy at the National Cancer 
      Center Hospital in Tokyo. Patients who had consulted the dentist for
      periodontitis were included in the study. We examined the interval between the
      initiation of the first bevacizumab administration and the day of the
      consultation with the dentist. Periodontitis was evaluated before and after
      conservative therapy. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (9.5 % of the 274 metastatic
      colorectal cancer patients) were included in this study. The median age was 60
      years (range 30-79 years). Nineteen (73 %) patients had a good performance status
      of 0. The combination regimens used with bevacizumab were infusional
      5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX, 53 %); infusional
      5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI, 27 %); capecitabine +
      oxaliplatin (CapeOX, 8 %); S-1 + oxaliplatin (8 %); and S-1 + irinotecan (4 %).
      The median time from bevacizumab administration to the consultation with a
      dentist for periodontitis was 69 days (range 12-390 days), and the median number 
      of bevacizumab administrations was 3.5 (range 1-25). After conservative therapy, 
      22 (85 %) patients with periodontitis showed an improvement. CONCLUSIONS:
      Periodontitis occurred frequently in patients receiving bevacizumab. The
      conservative therapy for periodontitis was very effective, and the prophylaxitic 
      treatment was important.

      on telomerase and telomeres.
PG  - 1074

AB  - Both human telomeric G-rich and C-rich DNA have been considered as specific drug 
      targets for cancer therapy. However, due to i-motif structure instability and
      lack of specific binding agents, it remains unclear whether stabilization of
      telomeric i-motif can inhibit telomerase activity. Single-walled carbon nanotubes
      (SWNTs) have been reported as the first ligand that can selectively stabilize
      human telomeric i-motif DNA. Here we report that SWNTs can inhibit telomerase
      activity through stabilization of i-motif structure. The persistence of i-motif
      and the concomitant G-quadruplex eventually leads to telomere uncapping and
      displaces telomere-binding proteins from telomere. The dysfunctional telomere
      triggers DNA damage response and elicits upregulation of p16 and p21 proteins.
      This is the first example that SWNTs can inhibit telomerase activity and
      interfere with the telomere functions in cancer cells. These results provide new 
      insights into understanding the biomedical effects of SWNTs and the biological
      importance of i-motif DNA.

TI  - The management of rectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases: a modern
      surgical dilemma.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1007/s10151-012-0888-4 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: One in ten patients with rectal cancer presents with synchronous
      colorectal liver metastases. We present an up-to-date review of the different
      surgical strategies available for rectal cancer patients with synchronous
      colorectal liver metastases. METHOD: A literature review of MEDLINE, Cochrane and
      Google scholar was performed. RESULTS: Twenty retrospective studies comparing
      staged versus simultaneous resections were found. Overall survival was similar
      for both approaches whilst the length of stay was decreased in simultaneous
      resections. Only two studies comparing the 'reverse' versus staged or
      simultaneous resections were found. The studies investigating resection versus
      non-resection for rectal primaries with unresectable liver metastases were
      limited. CONCLUSION: Simultaneous resections are a reasonable alternative to
      staged resections for either advanced rectal cancers with limited liver disease
      or early rectal cancers with extensive liver disease. Currently, staged
      resections are favoured over simultaneous resections in patients with locally
      advanced rectal cancers with extensive liver disease. There are too few studies
      to determine the safety of reverse resections in the context of locally advanced 
      rectal cancers. A resection of the primary tumour or a non-surgical intervention 
      can be justified in the management of the rectal cancer primary in the presence
      of unresectable liver metastases.

TI  - DAPK plays an important role in panobinostat-induced autophagy and commits cells 
      to apoptosis under autophagy deficient conditions.
PG  - 1300-15

AB  - The histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) LBH589 has been verified as an
      effective anticancer agent. The identification and characterization of new
      targets for LBH589 action would further enhance our understanding of the
      molecular mechanisms involved in HDACi therapy. The role of the tumor suppressor 
      death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) in LBH589-induced cytotoxicity has not
      been investigated to date. Stable DAPK knockdown (shRNA) and DAPK overexpressing 
      (DAPK+++) cell lines were generated from HCT116 wildtype colon cancer cells.
      LBH589 inhibited cell proliferation, reduced the long-term survival, and
      up-regulated and activated DAPK in colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, LBH589
      significantly suppressed the growth of colon tumor xenografts and in accordance
      with the in vitro studies, increased DAPK levels were detected
      immunohistochemically. LBH589 induced a DAPK-dependent autophagy as assessed by
      punctuate accumulation of LC3-II, the formation of acidic vesicular organelles,
      and degradation of p62 protein. LBH589-induced autophagy seems to be
      predominantly caused by DAPK protein interactions than by its kinase activity.
      Caspase inhibitor zVAD increased autophagosome formation, decreased the cleavage 
      of caspase 3 and PARP but didn't rescue the cells from LBH589-induced cell death 
      in crystal violet staining suggesting both caspase-dependent as well as
      caspase-independent apoptosis pathways. Pre-treatment with the autophagy
      inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 caused caspase 3-mediated apoptosis in a DAPK-dependent 
      manner. Altogether our data suggest that DAPK induces autophagy in response to
      HDACi-treatment. In autophagy deficient cells, DAPK plays an essential role in
      committing cells to HDACi-induced apoptosis.

TI  - Peripheral zone prostate cancer localization by multiparametric magnetic
      resonance at 3 T: unbiased cancer identification by matching to histopathology.
PG  - 624-33
LID - 10.1097/RLI.0b013e318263f0fd [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of
      peripheral zone prostate cancer localization by multiparametric magnetic
      resonance (MR) at 3 T using segmental matching of histopathology and MR images to
      avoid bias by image features in selection of cancer and noncancer regions.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients underwent multiparametric MR imaging 
      (MRI) on a 3 T system using a phased array body coil and spine coil elements for 
      signal detection before prostatectomy. The examination included T2-weighted
      imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast-enhanced
      imaging (DCE-MRI), and MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). Histopathology slides
      were correlated to T2W images and a stringent matching procedure was performed to
      define cancer and noncancer areas of the peripheral zone without influence of the
      MR image appearance. Mean T2W signal intensity, apparent diffusion coefficient,
      area under the enhancement curve, and choline + creatine-to-citrate signal ratio 
      were calculated for cancer and noncancer areas. Receiver operating characteristic
      (ROC) analysis was performed on MR-derived parameters from the selected areas.
      Logistic regression was used to create models based on best combination of
      parameters. A simplified approach assigning a parametric score to each segment
      based on cutoff values from ROC analysis was also explored. RESULTS: By using the
      stringent matching procedure, 138 noncancer and 41 cancer segments were selected 
      in the T2W images and transferred to the images of the other MR methods. A
      significant difference between mean values in cancer and noncancer segments was
      observed for all MR parameters analyzed (P < 0.001). Apparent diffusion
      coefficient was the best performing single parameter, with an area under the ROC 
      curve Az,DWI of 0.90 for prostate cancer detection. Any combination of T2WI, DWI,
      and DCE-MRI was significantly better than T2WI alone in separating cancer from
      noncancer segments (Az,T2WI + DWI + DCE-MRI = 0.94, Az,T2WI + DWI = 0.92, Az,T2WI
      + DCE-MRI = 0.91, Az,T2WI = 0.85). The combination of T2WI and MRSI was also
      better than T2WI alone (Az, T2WI + MRSI = 0.90); however, the logistic regression
      models including MRSI did not have significant parameters. The simplified
      approach combining all parameters gave similar results to logistic regression
      combining all parameters (Az = 0.95 and 0.97, respectively). CONCLUSION: By
      selecting histopathology defined cancer and noncancer areas without influence of 
      image contrast, this study objectively reveals that all investigated MR
      parameters have the ability to separate cancer from noncancer areas in the
      peripheral zone individually and that any combination is better than T2WI alone.

TI  - [Epidemiology of occupational skin cancer due to UV-irradiation].
PG  - 769-77
LID - 10.1007/s00105-012-2395-y [doi]
AB  - Skin cancer induced by occupational UV-irradiation is not an official
      occupational disease number in the appendix of the German ordinance on
      occupational diseases (Berufskrankheitenverordnung (BKV) but can be recognized as
      a "virtually" occupational disease according to section sign 9 (2) of the 7th
      book of the German Social Code (SGB VII). Epidemiological studies have
      demonstrated a positive, statistically significant and relevant association
      between occupational UV-irradiation and the risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
      and actinic keratoses (AK). Outdoor workers have on average a 100% higher risk to
      develop SCC compared to the general population. Therefore, the prerequisites for 
      a new occupational disease are fulfilled and SCC and AK should be reported as an 
      occupational disease if an additional 40% occupationally-related UV-irradiation
      is documented and the clinical criteria are typical for work- related skin
      cancer. Epidemiologic evidence also indicates a significant association between
      work-related UV-irradiation and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) risk: however the
      results are less consistent and the association is weaker than with SCC. There is
      an urgent need for further studies in outdoor workers on BCC and lentigo maligna 
      melanoma.

TI  - Gastric adenocarcinoma trends in the central region of Rio Grande do Sul
      (Southern Brazil): what has changed in 25 years?
PG  - 178-83
LID - S0004-28032012000300002 [pii]
AB  - CONTEXT: Gastric cancer is the fourth most common malignancy in the world. Its
      incidence varies greatly by geographic region. The highest rate is in Eastern
      Asia, mainly in Japan and China. In Brazil, gastric cancer is the third most
      common cancer in males and the fifth most common cancer in females. Rio Grande do
      Sul state, in Southern Brazil, has similar figures. The main histological type of
      gastric cancer is adenocarcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To assess the trends of this cancer 
      over 25 years in a reference center in central Rio Grande do Sul. METHODS: We
      reviewed the records of upper gastrointestinal endoscopies performed at the
      University Hospital of Santa Maria, RS, between 1986 and 2010. We evaluated the
      incidence, age and gender distribution, anatomical subsite and histological
      subtype of gastric cancer throughout this 25-year period. RESULTS: We identified 
      histologically confirmed primary gastric adenocarcinoma in 335 (1.6%) of the
      20,521 patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy during the study
      period. The mean age of patients was 62.4 (+/- 13.0) years, and 67.8% were male
      (a male: female ratio of 2.0:1). Cardia cancer accounted for 14.3% of the cases, 
      and non-cardia cancer accounted for 85.7%. According to Lauren's classification, 
      48.1% were intestinal subtype and 40.9% were diffuse subtype. There were no
      differences in mean age or gender distribution by anatomical location or
      histological subtype. There was also no difference in the proportions of
      histological subtypes by anatomical location. Over the 25-year period, there was 
      no change in the anatomical distribution of tumors, but there was a significant
      decrease in the intestinal subtype and a steady increase in the diffuse subtype
      (P = 0.02). The subset of 39 patients (11.6%) who presented at < 45 years of age 
      was more likely to be female and to have tumors of the diffuse subtype than was
      the total series of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Over this 25-year period, there were
      no significant trends in age, gender distribution, or the proportions of cardia
      and non-cardia gastric adenocarcinomas in this series of patients from Southern
      Brazil. There was a significant decrease in the intestinal subtype and a steady
      increase in the diffuse subtype of this malignancy. In patients under 45 years
      old, gastric cancer was more frequent in women, and the diffuse subtype
      predominated.

AB  - CONTEXT: The most recent global estimate revealed the presence of about one
      million new cases of stomach cancer for the year 2008, setting itself as the
      fourth most common cause of cancer. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to assess
      the trend of mortality from stomach cancer in Brazil according to regions between
      1980 and 2009. METHODS: Data on deaths from stomach cancer were obtained from the
      Mortality Information System, and the demographic data, from the Brazilian
      Institute of Geography and Statistics. The rates of mortality were standardized
      by age according to world population. The trend curves were calculated for
      Brazilian regions by sex. The technique used was polynomial regression and
      joinpoint. RESULTS: The tendency for males and females is similar in all regions,
      although the magnitude is higher among men in all places. Regions Midwest, South,
      Southeast tended to decline, while the Northern region showed no significant
      trend, and the Northeast tended to increase. CONCLUSION: It is therefore a need
      to evaluate public health policies for gastric cancer aimed at the demographic
      transition (change of urbanization and lifestyle) that is occurring throughout
      the country.

TI  - Alimentary factors in the development of gastric intestinal metaplasia in
      functional dyspeptic patients.
PG  - 208-13

AB  - CONTEXT: Intestinal metaplasia of the stomach is a lesion in which metaplasia of 
      gastric epithelial cells occurs for an intestinal phenotype. Gastric intestinal
      metaplasia is a lesion associated with an increase in the risk of gastric
      carcinoma development. Epidemiologic studies indicate a relation between dietary 
      habits and stomach cancer development, some habits increasing the risk for it,
      and others have a protective effect, suggesting that antioxidants, such as
      vitamins A, C, and E, decrease the risk of this type of cancer. The relationship 
      of these alimentary factors and intestinal metaplasia is unknown. METHODS: It is 
      a case-control, observational study in which 320 patients with functional
      dyspepsia, divided in two groups, were assessed. The case I group (individuals
      with intestinal metaplasia) had their dietary pattern compared to that of the
      control group, constituted of individuals similar to those in the case group but 
      without intestinal metaplasia, through a food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS:
      The analysis of the dietary pattern of functional dyspeptic patients with
      intestinal metaplasia, and its comparison with those without intestinal
      metaplasia, showed a higher frequency of canned and smoked foods consumption in
      the first group and, on the other hand, a higher consumption of fruits and
      vegetables in patients without intestinal metaplasia. No effect of salt
      consumption was detected. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study suggest
      changes in the diet, with a decrease in the consumption of smoked and canned
      foods, and an increase in the consumption of fruits and vegetables, can lead to a
      diminution of gastric intestinal metaplasia cases.

TI  - Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for nutritional palliation of upper
      esophageal cancer unsuitable for esophageal stenting.
PG  - 227-31
LID - S0004-28032012000300012 [pii]
AB  - CONTEXT: Esophageal cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and has a poor
      prognosis. Most patients with advanced esophageal cancer have significant
      dysphagia that contributes to weight loss and malnutrition. Esophageal stenting
      is a widespread palliation approach, but unsuitable for cancers near the upper
      esophageal sphincter, were stents are poorly tolerated. Generally, guidelines do 
      not support endoscopic gastrostomy in this clinical setting, but it may be the
      best option for nutritional support. OBJECTIVE: Retrospective evaluation of
      patients with dysphagia caused advanced esophageal cancer, no expectation of
      resuming oral intake and with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for comfort
      palliative nutrition. METHOD: We selected adult patients with unresecable
      esophageal cancer histological confirmed, in whom stenting was impossible due to 
      proximal location, and chemotherapy or radiotherapy were palliative, using
      gastrostomy for enteral nutrition. Clinical and nutritional data were evaluated, 
      including success of gastrostomy, procedure complications and survival after
      percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, and evolution of body mass index, albumin,
      transferrin and cholesterol. RESULTS: Seventeen males with stage III or IV
      squamous cell carcinoma fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 60.9
      years. Most of the patients had toxic habits. All underwent palliative
      chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Gastrostomy was successfully performed in all, but 
      nine required prior dilatation. Most had the gastrostomy within 2 months after
      diagnosis. There was a buried bumper syndrome treated with tube replacement and
      four minor complications. There were no cases of implantation metastases or
      procedure related mortality. Two patients were lost and 12 died. Mean survival of
      deceased patients was 5.9 months. Three patients are alive 6, 14 and 17 months
      after the gastrostomy procedure, still increasing the mean survival. Mean body
      mass index and laboratory parameters were roughly stable 1 and 3 months after the
      gastrostomy procedure. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced upper esophageal
      cancer where only palliative treatment is possible, nutritional support is easily
      achieved with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, allowing patients to be at
      homes, surviving a significant period of time. Percutaneous endoscopic
      gastrostomy feeding should be considered as standard definitive nutritional
      palliation in patients with upper esophageal cancer, unsuitable for esophageal
      stenting.

TI  - Synthesis and cytotoxicity evaluation of 13-n-alkyl berberine and palmatine
      analogues as anticancer agents.
PG  - 11294-302
AB  - By introducing long carbon-chain alkyl groups at the C-13 position of berberine
      and palmatine, 13-n-hexyl/13-n-octyl berberine and palmatine chloride analogues
      4a-d were synthesized and examined by MTT assays for cytotoxic activity in seven 
      human cancer cell lines (7701QGY, SMMC7721, HepG2, CEM, CEM/VCR, KIII, Lewis),
      yielding IC(5)(0) values of 0.02 +/- 0.01-13.58 +/- 2.84 muM. 13-n-Octyl
      palmatine (compound 4d) gave the most potent inhibitor activity, with an IC(5)(0)
      of 0.02 +/- 0.01 muM for SMMC7721. In all cases, the 13-n-alkyl berberine and
      palmatine analogues 4a-d were more cytotoxic than berberine and palmatine. In
      addition, compounds 4a-d also exhibited more potent cytotoxicity than berberine
      and palmatine in mice with S180 sarcoma xenografted in vivo. The primary
      screening results indicated that the 13-n-hexyl/13-n-octyl berberine and
      palmatine analogues might be valuable source for new potent anticancer drug
      candidates.

TI  - Wnt pathway activation predicts increased risk of tumor recurrence in patients
      with stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer.
PG  - 548-54
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0b013e31826d81fd [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of Wnt pathway activation in patients with 
      stage I NSCLC and its influence on lung cancer recurrence. BACKGROUND: Despite
      resection, the 5-year recurrence with localized stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) is 18.4%-24%. Aberrant Wnt signaling activation plays an important role
      in a wide variety of tumor types. However, there is not much known about the role
      the Wnt pathway plays in patients with stage I lung cancer. METHODS: Tumor and
      normal lung tissues from 55 patients following resection for stage I NSCLC were
      subjected to glutathione S-transferase (GST) E-cadherin pulldown and immunoblot
      analysis to assess levels of uncomplexed beta-catenin, a reliable measure of Wnt 
      signaling activation. The beta-catenin gene was also screened for oncogenic
      mutations in tumors with activated Wnt signaling. Cancer recurrence rates were
      correlated in a blinded manner in patients with Wnt pathway-positive and
      -negative tumors. RESULTS: Tumors in 20 patients (36.4%) scored as Wnt positive, 
      with only 1 exhibiting a beta-catenin oncogenic mutation. Patients with
      Wnt-positive tumors experienced a significantly higher rate of overall cancer
      recurrence than those with Wnt-negative tumors (30.0% vs. 5.7%, P = 0.02), with
      25.0% exhibiting distal tumor recurrence compared with 2.9% in the Wnt-negative
      group (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Wnt pathway activation occurred in a substantial
      fraction of Stage I NSCLCs, which was rarely due to mutations. Moreover, Wnt
      pathway activation was associated with a significantly higher rate of tumor
      recurrence. These findings suggest that Wnt pathway activation reflects a more
      aggressive tumor phenotype and identifies patients who may benefit from more
      aggressive therapy in addition to resection.

LID - 10.1038/bjc.2012.433 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of processed meat in the aetiology of several cancers was
      explored in detail. METHODS: In the time period 1996-2004, a multisite
      case-control study was conducted in Montevideo, Uruguay. The study included 6 060
      participants (3 528 cases and 2 532 controls) corresponding to cancers of the
      oral cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, larynx, lung, female
      breast, prostate, urinary bladder, and kidney (renal cell carcinoma only).
      RESULTS: The highest odds ratios (ORs) were positively associated with cancers of
      the colon, rectum, stomach, oesophagus, and lung. With the exception of renal
      cell carcinoma, the remaining cancer sites were significantly associated with
      elevated risks for processed meat consumption. Furthermore, mortadella, salami,
      hot dog, ham, and salted meat were strongly associated with risk of several
      cancer sites. CONCLUSION: It could be concluded that processed meat intake could 
      be a powerful multiorgan carcinogen.

PG  - 1451-3
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2012.438 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus and hormonal contraceptives may be risk factors 
      for cervical precancer and malignant breast tumours. METHODS: Standardised
      incidence ratios (SIRs) of malignant breast tumours during 1970-2008 were
      estimated separately for women with prior squamous and glandular cervical
      precancer. RESULTS: Women with squamous precancer and women with glandular
      precancer in the cervix had a significantly higher risk of malignant breast
      tumours than the general female population (SIR, 95% confidence interval: 1.10,
      1.05-1.14 and 1.52, 1.11-2.08, respectively). INTERPRETATION: Shared risk factors
      or screening attendance may explain the excess risk of malignant breast tumours
      among women with a history of cervical precancer.

      survival: a cohort study.
PG  - 1602-7
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2012.427 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aspirin has been widely reported to reduce the incidence of
      colorectal cancer. Recently, a survival benefit after diagnosis has also been
      suggested. Data regarding such a benefit are to date contradictory. This study
      examines the effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use on
      mortality in colorectal cancer in a larger patient cohort than previously to
      further clarify this effect, especially in terms of exposure timing and dosing.
      METHODS: A study using the General Practice Research Database assessed whether
      aspirin or NSAID exposure in the year immediately following diagnosis affected
      all-cause mortality in a cohort of 13 994 colorectal cancer patients. Cox
      proportional hazards modelling adjusted for age, gender, smoking, body mass index
      and comorbidity. RESULTS: Overall mortality was slightly lower in patients
      treated with aspirin, (hazard ratio (HR)=0.91; 95% confidence interval
      (CI)=0.82-1.00). This effect was observed only in patients treated with
      prophylaxis-dose aspirin (HR=0.89, CI=0.80-0.98) and only in patients taking
      aspirin before diagnosis (HR=0.86, CI=0.76-0.98). Differential effects were
      observed depending on the time after diagnosis. Up to 5 years, a reduction in
      mortality was observed for aspirin users (HR=0.83, CI=0.75-0.92), whereas after
      10 years there was an increase in mortality (HR=1.94, CI=1.26-2.99). For NSAID
      use, no significant effect was observed on overall mortality (HR=1.07,
      CI=0.98-1.15). High-dose NSAID use was associated with a slight increase in
      mortality (HR=1.41, CI=1.26-1.56). INTERPRETATION: These findings provide further
      indication that aspirin may be beneficial in reducing mortality in colorectal
      cancer during the first 5 years. The same cannot be said for other NSAIDs, where 
      a small increase in mortality was observed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate HPV vaccine acceptability and prescription; knowledge
      about HPV vaccine; and knowledge about HPV infection and cervical cancer among
      Argentinean gynecologists. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between November 2009 and March
      2010 we carried out an internet survey of 686 gynecologists. RESULTS: More than
      80% of gynecologists prescribed HPV vaccine, knew characteristics of HPV
      vaccines, and knew that women will still need regular cervical cancer screening
      after HPV vaccination; 37% had global knowledge about relationship between
      vaccine, detection and treatment of cervical cancer; 25% underestimated the
      epidemiological extent of HPV infections, approximately 30% was not aware of the 
      causative relationship between HPV infection and cervical cancer and
      approximately 40% had global knowledge about management of HPV infection.
      CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccine acceptability is high. Physicians need to be fully
      informed on HPV vaccination and cervical cancer as well as HPV infection
      management.

TI  - Evaluation of chromosome 6p22 as a breast cancer risk modifier locus in a
      follow-up study of BRCA2 mutation carriers.
PG  - 295-302
LID - 10.1007/s10549-012-2255-6 [doi]
AB  - Several common germline variants identified through genome-wide association
      studies of breast cancer risk in the general population have recently been shown 
      to be associated with breast cancer risk for BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation
      carriers. When combined, these variants can identify marked differences in the
      absolute risk of developing breast cancer for mutation carriers, suggesting that 
      additional modifier loci may further enhance individual risk assessment for BRCA1
      and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Recently, a common variant on 6p22 (rs9393597) was
      found to be associated with increased breast cancer risk for BRCA2 mutation
      carriers [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.55, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.25-1.92, p = 
      6.0 x 10(-5)]. This observation was based on data from GWAS studies in which,
      despite statistical correction for multiple comparisons, the possibility of false
      discovery remains a concern. Here, we report on an analysis of this variant in an
      additional 6,165 BRCA1 and 3,900 BRCA2 mutation carriers from the Consortium of
      Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA). In this replication analysis,
      rs9393597 was not associated with breast cancer risk for BRCA2 mutation carriers 
      (HR = 1.09, 95 % CI 0.96-1.24, p = 0.18). No association with ovarian cancer risk
      for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers or with breast cancer risk for BRCA1
      mutation carriers was observed. This follow-up study suggests that, contrary to
      our initial report, this variant is not associated with breast cancer risk among 
      individuals with germline BRCA2 mutations.

      capillary electrophoresis as a direct probe.

LID - 10.1039/c2mt20141k [doi]
AB  - Metal-based nanoscale particles possess unique optoelectronic or magnetic
      properties that make them highly promising as imaging agents in cancer therapy
      research. The fate of nanoparticles in vivo and particularly, the delivery to
      tumours are closely related to their interactions with plasma proteins.
      Furthermore, proteins can be used to modify the nanoparticle surface in order to 
      facilitate active targeting to tumours. Therefore, there is an ongoing need for
      new and more capable analytical methodologies to characterize the
      protein-nanoparticle binding. Due to the small-sample volume requirement, high
      degree of resolution and, most importantly, mild, species-friendly separation
      conditions, capillary electrophoresis (CE) is gaining increasing popularity in
      the analysis of protein-nanoparticle interaction. This perspective article
      highlights the potential of CE in studying reactions associated with
      protein-mediated transformations of nanoparticles, with the focus on quantum
      dots, gold and iron oxide nanoparticles. Different ways by which CE can be
      applied to such monitoring are summarized and critically assessed using a
      representative coverage of recent publications.

TI  - Estrogen in obesity-associated colon cancer: friend or foe? Protecting
      postmenopausal women but promoting late-stage colon cancer.
PG  - 1767-73
LID - 10.1007/s10552-012-0066-z [doi]
AB  - Obesity is associated with the increased incidence of colon cancer. Many cancer
      risk factors have been identified including increased blood levels of insulin,
      leptin, interleukin-6, interleukin-17, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and decreased
      blood levels of adiponectin. However, the role of blood levels of estrogen in
      obesity-associated colon cancer is controversial. Evidence showed that obesity
      affected men more strongly than women in the carcinogenesis of colon cancer,
      indicating protective effect of estrogen which is increased in obesity. However, 
      an epidemiological study has also shown that endogenous estradiol level is an
      independent risk factor for colon cancer, positively associated with colon cancer
      after normalizing insulin, IGF-1. The controversial opinions may be caused by
      different effects of ER-alpha and ER-beta. ER-alpha can increase colon cancer
      cell proliferation and increase cancer incidence. ER-beta has the opposite effect
      to ER-alpha, and it causes apoptosis of colon cancer cells. The normal
      colonocytes mainly express ER-beta. Therefore, increased estrogen in obesity may 
      have protective effect via ER-beta in obesity-associated colon cancer. However,
      with the development of colon cancer, ER-alpha is increased and ER-beta is
      decreased. In the late stage of colon cancer, estrogen may promote cancer
      development via ER-alpha. The different effects and expression of ER-alpha and
      ER-beta may explain the different results observed in several epidemiological
      studies as well as several animal experiments. Therefore, manipulation of
      estrogen-caused signal pathways to inhibit ER-alpha and stimulate ER-beta may
      have preventive and therapeutic effect for obesity-associated colon cancer.

TI  - Screening practices of Australian men and women categorized as "at or slightly
      above average risk" of colorectal cancer.

AB  - PURPOSE: Australia has one of the highest incidences of colorectal cancer (CRC)
      in the world. In 2006, the federal government introduced a screening program
      consisting of a one-off fecal occult blood test offered to people turning 50, 55,
      or 65 years. We conducted a population-based study to estimate CRC screening
      practices existing outside the current program. METHODS: A total of 1887
      unaffected subjects categorized "at or slightly above average risk" of CRC were
      selected from the Australasian Colorectal Cancer Family Registry. We calculated
      the proportions of participants that reported appropriate, under- and
      over-screening according to national guidelines. We performed a logistic
      regression analysis to evaluate associations between over-screening and a set of 
      socio-demographic factors. RESULTS: Of 532 participants at average risk of CRC,
      eligible for screening, 4 (0.75 %) reported appropriate screening, 479 (90 %)
      reported never having been screened, 18 (3 %) reported some but less than
      appropriate screening, and 31 (6 %) reported over-screening. Of 412 participants 
      aged 50 years or over, slightly above average risk of CRC, 1 participant (0.25 %)
      reported appropriate screening, 316 (77 %) reported no screening, and 11 (3 %)
      reported some but less than appropriate screening. Among participants under age
      50 years, 2 % of those at average risk and 10 % of those slightly above average
      risk reported over-screening. Middle-aged people, those with a family history of 
      CRC and those with a university degree, were more likely to be over-screened.
      CONCLUSION: Overall, the level of CRC screening participation was low and the
      vast majority of screening tests undertaken were inappropriate in terms of
      timing, modality, or frequency.

TI  - Recruitment of ethnic minorities into cancer clinical trials: experience from the
      front lines.
PG  - 1017-21
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2012.240 [doi]
AB  - Throughout the world there are problems recruiting ethnic minority patients into 
      cancer clinical trials. A major barrier to trial entry may be distrust of
      research and the medical system. This may be compounded by the regulatory
      framework governing research with an emphasis on written consent, closed
      questions and consent documentation, as well as fiscal issues. The Leicester UK
      experience is that trial accrual is better if British South Asian patients are
      approached by a senior doctor rather than someone of perceived lesser
      hierarchical status and a greater partnership between the hospital and General
      Practitioner may increase trial participation of this particular ethnic minority.
      In Los Angeles, USA, trial recruitment was improved by a greater utilisation of
      Hispanic staff and a Spanish language-based education programme. Involvement of
      community leaders is essential. While adhering to national, legal and ethnical
      standards, information sheets and consent, it helps if forms can be tailored
      towards the local ethnic minority population. Written translations are often of
      limited value in the recruitment of patients with no or limited knowledge of
      English. In some cultural settings, tape-recorded verbal consent (following
      approval presentations) may be an acceptable substitute for written consent, and 
      appropriate legislative changes should be considered to facilitate this option.
      Approaches should be tailored to specific minority populations, taking
      consideration of their unique characteristics and with input from their community
      leadership.

TI  - The prognostic importance of miR-21 in stage II colon cancer: a population-based 
      study.
PG  - 1169-74
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2012.365 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite several years of research and attempts to develop prognostic 
      models a considerable fraction of stage II colon cancer patients will experience 
      relapse within few years from their operation. The aim of the present study was
      to investigate the prognostic importance of miRNA-21 (miR-21), quantified by in
      situ hybridisation, in a unique, large population-based cohort. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: The study included 764 patients diagnosed with stage II colon cancer in 
      Denmark in the year 2003. One section from a representative paraffin-embedded
      tumour tissue specimen from each patient was processed for analysis of miR-21 and
      quantitatively assessed by image analysis. RESULTS: The miR-21 signal was
      predominantly observed in fibroblast-like cells located in the stromal
      compartment of the tumours. We found that patients expressing high levels of
      miR-21 had significantly inferior recurrence-free cancer-specific survival
      (RF-CSS): HR=1.26; 95% CI: 1.15-1.60; P<0.001. In Cox regression analysis, a high
      level of miR-21 retained its prognostic importance and was found to be
      significantly related to poor RF-CSS: HR=1.41; 95% CI: 1.19-1.67; P<0.001.
      CONCLUSION: The present study showed that increasing miR-21 expression levels
      were significantly correlated to decreasing RF-CSS. Further investigations of the
      clinical importance of miR-21 in the selection of high-risk stage II colon cancer
      patients are merited.

TI  - Association study identifying polymorphisms in CD47 and other extracellular
      matrix pathway genes as putative prognostic markers for colorectal cancer.
PG  - 173-81
LID - 10.1007/s00384-012-1541-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We identified recently the extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor
      interaction pathway as a consistently overrepresented category among gene
      expression profiling studies on colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis. METHODS:
      Putative regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes from the ECM 
      pathway were genotyped in 613 CRC patients from Northern Germany (PopGen cohort) 
      and tested for association with disease progression and survival. RESULTS: The
      eSNP (SNP associated with expression) rs12695175 in CD47 associated with CRC
      specific survival (HR = 2.18, 95 % CI 1.10-4.33, CC versus AA) and with overall
      survival (HR = 1.99, 95 % CI 1.04-3.81, CC versus AA). This association remained 
      significant after adjustment for age at diagnosis, tumour stage (T) and lymph
      node status (N). Three polymorphisms in CD47 were associated with distant
      metastasis in a dominant model: rs9879947 and rs3206652 in the 3'-UTR (OR = 1.64,
      95 % CI 1.01-2.64 and OR = 1.88, 95 % CI 1.27-2.80, respectively) and the eSNP
      rs3804639 (OR = 1.73, 95 % CI 1.17-2.57). CONCLUSIONS: The novel associations of 
      eSNPs in CD47 with worse survival and distant metastasis should be confirmed by
      additional studies, since increased expression of this gene has recently been
      shown to be an indicator of poor prognosis in cancer patients.

TI  - Anal carcinoma: FDG PET/CT in staging, response evaluation, and follow-up.
PG  - 728-35
LID - 10.1007/s00261-012-9958-3 [doi]
AB  - The role of FDG PET/CT in anal cancer is becoming increasingly important. At the 
      time of initial staging, FDG PET/CT can detect the primary site of disease more
      frequently than CT, is sensitive for nodal and metastatic spread and alters
      staging in a significant number of patients. Indeed, the NCCN guidelines for anal
      cancer published in April 2012 recommend FDG PET/CT for therapy planning.
      Metabolic activity of primary anal cancer at presentation is a potential
      biomarker for predicting prognosis, treatment response and survival. More
      intensely FDG-avid primary malignancy is associated with a higher incidence of
      disease spread. Metabolic response following chemoradiotherapy is associated with
      improved survival. The aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date pictorial
      review of FDG PET/CT in anal cancer at the time of staging and to illustrate its 
      utility for determining response to therapy and detecting recurrent disease.

TI  - Ginkgo biloba extract attenuates hyperalgesia in a rat model of
      vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy.
PG  - 1228-33
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0b013e318262e170 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a common, dose-limiting
      side effect of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs. Hyperalgesia is a common component 
      of neuropathic pain. Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) is an oriental herbal medicine
      that has various pharmacological actions. In this study, we evaluated the effects
      of oral GBE on hyperalgesia in a rat model of vincristine-induced neuropathy.
      METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) were injected intraperitoneally
      with vincristine or saline (0.1 mg/kg/d) using a 5-day-on, 2-day-off schedule
      over 12 days. All the behavioral tests for mechanical, cold, and heat
      hyperalgesia were conducted before the daily injection during the course of
      vincristine treatment. Rats that developed hyperalgesia 14 days after vincristine
      injection were randomly assigned into 4 groups. Distilled water and GBE (50, 100,
      and 150 mg/kg) were administered, respectively, to the individual groups. We
      examined the hyperalgesia at preadministration and at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150,
      and 180 minutes after oral drug administration. RESULTS: Saline injection did not
      have any significant effect on mechanical, cold, and heat hyperalgesia.
      Vincristine injection produced mechanical and cold hyperalgesia. For the GBE
      groups, the paw withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimuli was significantly
      increased and withdrawal frequency to cold stimuli was significantly reduced
      versus the control group dose-dependently (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study
      demonstrates that oral administration of GBE is associated with a dose-dependent 
      antihyperalgesic effect on mechanical and cold stimuli in a rat model of
      vincristine-induced neuropathy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of cancer survivorship in the USA is expected to
      increase in the future because the US population is increasing in size and is
      aging and because survival following diagnosis is improving for many types of
      cancer. Medical care costs associated with cancer are also projected to increase 
      dramatically. However, currently available data for estimating medical care costs
      and other important aspects of the burden of cancer, including time spent
      receiving medical care, productivity loss due to morbidity for patients and their
      families, and financial hardship, are limited, particularly in the population
      under the age of 65. METHODS: We describe selected publicly available data
      sources for estimating the burden of cancer in the USA and a new collaborative
      effort to improve the quality of these data: the nationally representative
      Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) Experiences with Cancer Survivorship
      Supplement. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this effort can be used to address key gaps in
      cancer survivorship research related to medical care costs, employment patterns, 
      financial hardship, and other aspects of the burden of illness for cancer
      survivors and their families. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Research using
      the MEPS Experiences with Cancer Survivorship Supplement can inform efforts by
      health care policy makers, healthcare systems, providers, and employers to
      improve the cancer survivorship experience in the USA.

TI  - Strategies for improving the clinical benefit of antiangiogenic drug based
      therapies for breast cancer.
PG  - 229-39
LID - 10.1007/s10911-012-9266-0 [doi]
AB  - Viewed as a whole, the aggregate outcomes of a number of positive randomized
      phase III clinical trial results evaluating the VEGF-pathway targeting
      antiangiogenic drug bevacizumab, with or without concurrent chemotherapy, in
      metastatic breast cancer patients have been disappointingly modest. In the case
      of antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) the results have been
      negative. Nevertheless, several findings indicate antiangiogenic drugs,
      especially bevacizumab, are active and can lead to demonstrable clinical benefit 
      in some patients, thus stimulating research into developing strategies to
      significantly improve their efficacy and reduce toxicity. Some of these
      initiatives include: 1) discovery and validation of predictive markers that can
      prospectively identify patients more likely to benefit from antiangiogenic
      therapy; 2) recognition that the nature of the chemotherapy partner or backbone
      can strongly impact outcomes when combined with antiangiogenic drugs such as
      bevacizumab, and thus developing what may be improved combination chemotherapy
      partner regimens, e.g. metronomic chemotherapy; 3) evaluating prospectively in
      more depth whether subtypes of the disease-especially triple negative or
      inflammatory breast cancer-are more responsive to antiangiogenic therapy than
      other subtypes; 4) evaluating new agents that inhibit angiogenesis in a
      VEGF-independent manner and other types of drug that can be effectively combined 
      with antiangiogenics, e.g. c-met inhibitors; 5) uncovering the basis of
      resistance or relapse/progression on the therapy with antiangiogenic drugs; 6)
      development of improved predictive preclinical breast cancer models for therapy
      testing, e.g. treatment of mice with established multi-organ breast cancer
      metastatic disease or genetically engineered mouse models of breast cancer, or
      mice bearing patient derived breast cancer tissue xenografts.

TI  - Translating mathematical modeling of tumor growth patterns into novel therapeutic
      approaches for breast cancer.
PG  - 241-9
LID - 10.1007/s10911-012-9267-z [doi]
AB  - In breast cancer, mortality is driven by the metastatic process, whereby some
      cancer cells leave their primary site of origin and travel to distant vital
      organs. Despite improved screening and therapies to treat breast cancers,
      metastasis continues to undermine these advances. The pervasive albatross of
      metastasis necessitates improved prevention and treatment of metastasis. To this 
      end, clinicians routinely employ post-operative or adjuvant therapy to decrease
      the risk of future metastasis and improve the chance for cure. This article
      evaluates the limitations of breast cancer therapies within the context of growth
      curves, and in doing so, provides new insight into the metastatic process as well
      as more effective means for therapeutic delivery. Two critical developments
      evolve from this mathematical analysis: first, the use of dose dense chemotherapy
      to improve survival among breast cancer patients; and second, the theory of
      self-seeding, which fundamentally changes our understanding of metastasis and the
      trajectory of drug development.

TI  - Protein predictive signatures for lymph node metastasis of gastric cancer.
PG  - 1851-9
LID - 10.1002/ijc.27864 [doi]
AB  - Lymph node status remains one of most crucial indicators of gastric cancer
      prognosis and treatment planning. Current imaging methods have limited accuracy
      in predicting lymph node metastasis. We sought to identify protein markers in
      primary gastric cancer and to define a risk model to predict lymph node
      metastasis. The Protein Pathway Array (PPA) (initial selection) and Western blot 
      (confirmation) were used to assess the protein expression in a total of 190
      freshly frozen gastric cancer samples. The protein expression levels were
      compared between samples with lymph node metastasis (n = 73) and those without
      lymph node metastasis (n = 57) using PPA. There were 27 proteins differentially
      expressed between lymph node positive samples and lymph node negative samples.
      Five proteins (Factor XIII B, TFIIH p89, ADAM8, COX-2 and CUL-1) were identified 
      as independent predictors of lymph node metastasis. Together with
      vascular/lymphatic invasion status, a risk score model was established to
      determine the risk of lymph node metastasis for each individual gastric cancer
      patient. The ability of this model to predict lymph node metastasis was further
      confirmed in a second cohort of gastric cancer patients (33 with and 27 without
      lymph node metastasis) using Western blot. This study indicated that some
      proteins differentially expressed in gastric cancer can be selected as clinically
      useful biomarkers. The risk score model is useful for determining patients' risk 
      of lymph node metastasis and prognosis.

TI  - Molecular dynamics analysis of a series of 22 potential farnesyltransferase
      substrates containing a CaaX-motif.
PG  - 673-88
LID - 10.1007/s00894-012-1590-1 [doi]
AB  - Protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) is an important target in many research
      fields, more markedly so in cancer investigation since several proteins known to 
      be involved in human cancer development are thought to serve as substrates for
      FTase and to require farnesylation for proper biological activity. Several FTase 
      inhibitors (FTIs) have advanced into clinical testing. Nevertheless, despite the 
      progress in the field several functional and mechanistic doubts on the FTase
      catalytic activity have persisted. This work provides some crucial information on
      this important enzyme by describing the application of molecular dynamics
      simulations using specifically designed molecular mechanical parameters for a
      variety of 22 CaaX peptides known to work as natural substrates or inhibitors for
      this enzyme. The study involves a comparative analysis of several important
      molecular aspects, at the mechanistic level, of the behavior of substrates and
      inhibitors at the dynamic level, including the behavior of the enzyme and
      peptides, as well as their interaction, together with the effect of the solvent. 
      Properties evaluated include the radial distribution function of the water
      molecules around the catalytically important zinc metal atom and cysteine sulfur 
      of CaaX, the conformations of the substrate and inhibitor and the corresponding
      RMSF values, critical hydrogen bonds, and several catalytically relevant
      distances. These results are discussed in light of recent experimental and
      computational evidence that provides new insights into the activity of this
      enzyme.

TI  - Sonographic features of triple-negative and non-triple-negative breast cancer.
PG  - 1531-41
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is known to have unique
      molecular, clinical, and pathologic characteristics. The growth pattern of this
      cancer may also affect its appearance on sonography. Our study evaluated the
      sonographic features of TNBC according to the American College of Radiology
      Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System sonographic classification system and
      compared these features with those of non-TNBC. METHODS: Data from 315
      consecutive breast cancer cases were collected. The images were reevaluated by an
      examiner blinded to the patients' characteristics and histologic results
      according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System. The sonographic
      features of TNBC (n = 33) and non-TNBC (n = 282) were compared. RESULTS:
      Triple-negative breast cancer was significantly correlated with a younger patient
      age (P = .002) and was associated with higher tumor grades (P < .001), more lymph
      node involvement (P = .014), and a trend toward a larger tumor size. With regard 
      to sonographic features, the margin of TNBC was more frequently described as
      lobulated or microlobulated (75.8% versus 49.5% in non-TNBC; P = .005). The
      echoic halo was observed significantly less often in TNBC than in non-TNBC(39.4% 
      versus 62.8%; P = .014). Cooper ligaments were displaced rather than disrupted in
      TNBC compared to non-TNBC (P = .003). Regarding the posterior acoustic features, 
      enhancement was observed significantly more often in TNBC (36.4% versus 13.0% in 
      non-TNBC; P = .031). CONCLUSIONS: Triple-negative breast cancer and non-TNBC have
      different sonographic features. This finding can be explained by the pathologic
      profile of this breast cancer subtype. Some of the distinct sonographic criteria 
      for TNBC are more likely to be associated with benign masses. Knowledge of the
      distinct sonographic features of TNBC would help the examiner avoid
      false-negative classification of this tumor type.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (US) and targeted microbubbles have been
      shown to be advantageous for angiogenesis evaluation and disease staging in
      cancer. This study explored molecular US imaging of a multitargeted microbubble

      analysis and characterization established with antibodies against mouse
      alpha(V)beta3- integrin, P-selectin, and vascular endothelial growth factor
      receptor 2. Tumor-bearing mice (n = 15 per group) underwent contrast-enhanced US 
      imaging of multitargeted microbubbles. Microbubble accumulation was calculated by
      destruction-replenishment techniques and time-intensity curve analysis. On day 0,
      mice underwent baseline imaging. Next, therapy group mice were injected with a
      0.2-mg dose of bevacizumab, and controls received matched saline injections.
      Imaging was repeated on days 1 and 3. After imaging was completed on day 3, the
      mice were euthanized and tumors excised. Histologic analysis of microvessel
      density and intratumoral necrosis was completed on tumor sections. RESULTS: On
      day 3 after bevacizumab dosing, a 71.8% change in tumor vasculature was shown
      between the therapy and control groups (P = .01). The therapy group had a 15.4%
      decrease in tumor vascularity, whereas the control group had a 56.4% increase.
      CONCLUSIONS: Molecular US imaging of angiogenic markers can detect the early
      tumor response to drug therapy.

AB  - Histone lysine methylation plays a fundamental role in chromatin organization.
      Although a set of histone methyltransferases have been identified and
      biochemically characterized, the pathological roles of their dysfunction in human
      cancers are still not well understood. In this study, we demonstrate important
      roles of WHSC1L1 in human carcinogenesis. Expression levels of WHSC1L1 transcript
      were significantly elevated in various human cancers including bladder carcinoma.
      Immunohistochemical analysis of bladder, lung, and liver cancers confirmed
      overexpression of WHSC1L1. WHSC1L1-specific small interfering RNAs significantly 
      knocked down its expression and resulted in suppression of proliferation of
      bladder and lung cancer cell lines. WHSC1L1 knockdown induced cell cycle arrest
      at the G(2)/M phase followed by multinucleation of cancer cells. Expression
      profile analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip((R)) showed that WHSC1L1 affected the 
      expression of a number of genes including CCNG1 and NEK7, which are known to play
      crucial roles in the cell cycle progression at mitosis. As WHSC1L1 expression is 
      significantly low in various normal tissues including vital organs, WHSC1L1 could
      be a good candidate molecule for development of novel treatment for various types
      of cancer.

TI  - Macrophage stimulating protein promotes liver metastases of small cell lung
      cancer cells by affecting the organ microenvironment.
PG  - 333-44
LID - 10.1007/s10585-012-9540-y [doi]
AB  - The organ microenvironment significantly affects the processes of cancer
      metastasis. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of interaction between tumor
      cells and the organ microenvironment is crucial for the development of effective 
      therapeutic strategies to eradicate cancer metastases. Macrophage stimulating
      protein (MSP), an activator of macrophages, regulates a pleiotropic array of
      effects, including proliferation, cellular motility, invasiveness, angiogenesis, 
      and resistance to anoikis. However, the role of MSP in cancer metastasis is still
      largely unknown. In this study, the action of MSP on the production of metastases
      was determined in a multiple-organ metastasis model. The murine MSP gene was
      transfected into two human SCLC cell lines, SBC-5 and H1048, to establish
      transfectants secreting biologically active MSP. MSP gene transduction did not
      affect cell proliferation and motility in vitro. Intravenously inoculated MSP
      transfectants produced significantly larger numbers of liver metastases than
      parental cells or vector control clones, while there were no significant
      differences in bone or lung metastases among them. Immunohistochemical analyses
      of liver metastases revealed that tumor-associated microvessel density and
      tumor-infiltrating macrophages were significantly increased in lesions produced
      by MSP transfectants. MSP could stimulate the migration of murine macrophages and
      endothelial cells in vitro. Consequently, MSP may be one of the major
      determinants that affects the properties of tumor stroma and that produces a
      permissive microenvironment to promote cancer metastasis.

TI  - Medullary thyroid cancer--current treatment strategy, novel therapies and
      perspectives for the future.
PG  - 218-26
LID - 10.1007/s12672-012-0119-5 [doi]
AB  - Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), an uncommon and slow-growing tumor, is difficult 
      to eradicate when metastasis or recurrence develops. This review describes
      therapeutic approaches to patients with recurrent sporadic MTC, management of
      advanced cases of MTC, and future treatment options. A literature review of
      treatment of MTC in humans was conducted. Surgery is currently the only
      potentially curative treatment for MTC; complete tumor resection and removal of
      suspicious nodes is the most important initial treatment to prevent recurrence
      and metastasis. When recurrence or metastatic MTC develops, the decision for
      continued observation or initiation of systemic therapy is based on the degree of
      tumor aggressiveness. Lymph node involvement, calcitonin doubling time, types of 
      RET mutation, and tumor stage are factors that help determine the need for
      further treatment. Therapeutic options for aggressive and inoperable MTC
      primarily include tyrosine kinase inhibitors, external beam radiation therapy, or
      other medications. Among tyrosine kinase inhibitors, vandetanib is the first drug
      that is FDA approved for treatment of MTC. Focused external beam radiation
      therapy can be reconsidered for patients with cervical node involvement. Although
      other targeted drug therapies have been tried, definitive clinical studies are
      lacking. In recurrent or advanced MTC, when systemic therapy is warranted,
      vandetanib is available for use in treatment; however, side effects of this drug 
      can be problematic, and impact on overall survival is presently unknown. Newer
      therapeutics are being studied with the goal of balancing control of tumor growth
      with maintaining the patient's quality of life.

TI  - IGFBP-3 nuclear localization predicts human prostate cancer recurrence.
PG  - 12-23
LID - 10.1007/s12672-012-0124-8 [doi]
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) is a pro-apoptotic,
      anti-metastasic, and anti-angiogenic protein. Low serum IGFBP-3 has been
      associated with risk of more aggressive prostate cancer (PCa). We investigated
      the impact of nuclear and cytoplasmic IGFBP-3 protein expression levels in PCa by
      examining their in situ expression across a wide spectrum of primary tumors by
      immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays. Immunohistochemistry was
      performed on PCa microarrays constructed from 226 hormone naive patients who
      underwent radical prostatectomy. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear IGFBP-3 expressions
      were scored in a semi-quantitative fashion using an integrated measure of
      intensity and positivity. The distribution of IGFBP-3 protein expression was
      examined across the spectrum of epithelial tissues, and its association with
      standard clinicopathological covariates and tumor recurrence was examined. There 
      was a broad range of IGFBP-3 staining across all histologies examined. Tumor had 
      higher IGFBP-3 cytoplasmic and nuclear staining than benign histologies. For
      IGFBP-3 nuclear staining, PCa was significantly different than benign prostatic
      hyperplasia, normal prostate, and prostate intraepithelial neoplasia. As both a
      continuous and dichotomized variable, higher nuclear IGFBP-3 expression had
      statistically significant associations with PCa recurrence. The cytoplasmic
      staining had no significance in any patient subgroup. In patients with low-grade 
      cancer, IGFBP-3 nuclear positivity was a better predictor of recurrence than
      baseline PSA, tumor margin status, TNM tumor stage, or presence of capsular
      invasion. High nuclear IGFBP-3 is amongst the strongest predictors of cancer
      recurrence in patients with low-grade prostate cancers and may therefore play an 
      important role in risk stratification.

TI  - Social determinants of health associated with cervical cancer screening among
      women living in developing countries: a scoping review.
PG  - 1487-505
LID - 10.1007/s00404-012-2575-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Thousands of women living in many middle and low-income countries
      are unnecessarily dying from cervical cancer, partly due to limited screening
      coverage. OBJECTIVES: To identify social determinants of health (SDH) associated 
      with cervical screening for women living in middle and low-income countries, to
      inform responses to improve SDH and screening coverage, and to identify research 
      gaps. METHODS: A scoping literature review. We located original research articles
      on SDH associated with cervical cancer screening through bibliographic databases,
      supplemented by hand searching (n=166+4). Included were those conducted in middle
      and low-income countries and published in English, Portuguese and Spanish
      academic journals between January 2000 and June 2011 (n=37). Excluded were those 
      from high-income countries or focusing on screening-diagnostic techniques or HPV 
      vaccine. Narrative synthesis examined the results in relation to a SDH framework.
      RESULTS: A number of factors influence access along the pathway to cervical
      cancer screening. Structural (cultural and societal values, socioeconomic
      position, ethnicity), intermediary (geographic location, health seeking
      behaviours, psychosocial factors, nature of the health system), and cross-cutting
      (social cohesion) SDH were all important. No single factor could entirely explain
      the observed cervical screening patterns. CONCLUSION: Cervical cancer screening
      among women living in middle and low-income countries are influenced by the
      interaction among several different SDH. The majority of researchers studying
      cervical cancer screening focused on exploring single socio-demographic
      variables, which is typical of positivist, biomedical and epidemiological
      research. An inter-sectionality approach may provide a richer understanding of
      the complexities that influence women's pathways to cervical cancer screening and
      assist design of international programmes and policies from a social justice
      perspective.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Human neutrophil proteins-1, -2, and -3 (HNPs -1, -2, and -3) are
      expressed in several tumor types. However, the role of HNPs 1-3 in human bladder 
      cancer has not yet been determined. We investigated the association between the
      plasma levels of HNPs 1-3 and clinicopathological parameters in bladder cancer
      patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: The plasma levels of HNPs 1-3 were measured in 60
      patients with bladder cancer and in 58 healthy controls. The plasma levels of
      HNPs 1-3 were determined by a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
      (ELISA). Plasma samples were obtained before surgery. Plasma samples were
      permitted to clot and were then stored at -80 degrees C until use. RESULTS: The
      levels of the HNPs increased from grade 1 to 4 tumors and this difference was
      statistically significant (p < 0.001). Additionally, plasma HNP levels were
      significantly higher in patients with metastatic bladder cancer and in patients
      with lymphovascular involvement, metastasis of the lymph nodes, and increased
      tumor burden (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The preoperative plasma levels of HNPs 1-3
      paralleled the progression and pathological stages of the malignancies. This
      study suggests that HNPs 1-3 promote tumor invasion and are potential indicators 
      of disease progression in patients with bladder cancer.

      adjuvant radiotherapy.
PG  - 187-94
LID - 10.1007/s00432-012-1318-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the prognostic significance of excision repair
      cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) expression in head and neck carcinoma
      patients treated with definitive radiotherapy (DR) or adjuvant radiotherapy (AR).
      METHODS: ERCC1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining. A total
      of 48 patients were assessed. RESULTS: High ERCC1 expression was found in 23
      patients (48 %). More ERCC1-positive tumours were detected in patients treated
      with DR than in patients treated with AR (73 vs. 36 %, respectively, p = 0.03).
      ERCC1 expression had no impact on overall survival neither in the whole cohort of
      patients (p = 0.16) nor in each particular treatment group (AR p = 0.98; DR p =
      0.21). CONCLUSIONS: ERCC1 expression had no predictive value in head and neck
      carcinoma patients treated with DR or AR. There might be difference in ERCC1
      positivity that comes out of whether the assessment is done on biopsy or surgical
      specimens.

TI  - Association between survival in patients with primary invasive breast cancer and 
      computer aided MRI.
PG  - 146-55
LID - 10.1002/jmri.23812 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the potential of semi-quantitative enhancement-analysis in
      breast MRI to predict disease-related death in primary breast cancer patients.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was planned and conducted according to
      international recommendations. All patients referred for pretherapeutic staging
      of primary breast cancer during 24 consecutive months were included into the
      study collective. They were followed-up by our multidisciplinary breast center.
      For semi-quantitative MRI-analysis dedicated CAD-software (computer assisted
      diagnosis) was used. Association between enhancement parameters and
      disease-related survival was investigated using Cox proportional-hazards
      -regression (CR). RESULTS: A total of 115 patients were eligible for CR analysis.
      Median follow-up time was 52 months. In 15 patients, disease-related death
      occurred. CR analysis identified four enhancement parameters as independent and
      significant (P < 0.001) predictors of the endpoint. Coefficients were "Initial
      enhancement" (B = 0.0166), "Time to peak-enhancement" (B = 1.0573), "Tumor
      volume" (B = 0.0175), and proportion of "tumor volume" showing "slow initial
      enhancement" followed by a "persistent" curve-type (B = -0.0586). CONCLUSION:
      This study demonstrates the significant relationship between semi-quantitative
      enhancement analysis in breast MRI and disease-related death of breast cancer
      patients. As results were extracted from a routine staging examination, MRI
      noninvasively provides not only diagnostic information but also outcome data at
      one step. Future studies should address the impact of these findings on patient
      management and therapeutic approach.

TI  - Canonical Wnt signaling regulates Slug activity and links epithelial-mesenchymal 
      transition with epigenetic Breast Cancer 1, Early Onset (BRCA1) repression.
PG  - 16654-9
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1205822109 [doi]
AB  - Slug (Snail2) plays critical roles in regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal
      transition (EMT) programs operative during development and disease. However, the 
      means by which Slug activity is controlled remain unclear. Herein we identify an 
      unrecognized canonical Wnt/GSK3beta/beta-Trcp1 axis that controls Slug activity. 
      In the absence of Wnt signaling, Slug is phosphorylated by GSK3beta and
      subsequently undergoes beta-Trcp1-dependent ubiquitination and proteosomal
      degradation. Alternatively, in the presence of canonical Wnt ligands, GSK3beta
      kinase activity is inhibited, nuclear Slug levels increase, and EMT programs are 
      initiated. Consistent with recent studies describing correlative associations in 
      basal-like breast cancers between Wnt signaling, increased Slug levels, and
      reduced expression of the tumor suppressor Breast Cancer 1, Early Onset (BRCA1), 
      further studies demonstrate that Slug-as well as Snail-directly represses BRCA1
      expression by recruiting the chromatin-demethylase, LSD1, and binding to a series
      of E-boxes located within the BRCA1 promoter. Consonant with these findings,
      nuclear Slug and Snail expression are increased in association with BRCA1
      repression in a cohort of triple-negative breast cancer patients. Together, these
      findings establish unique functional links between canonical Wnt signaling, Slug 
      expression, EMT, and BRCA1 regulation.

TI  - The selective expression of ret finger protein in endometrial cancer: can RFP be 
      a marker of serous carcinomas?
PG  - 213-9
LID - 10.5146/tjpath.2012.01127 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Endometrial cancer is a common malignancy of the gynecological system 
      and has been classified into two major groups, Types I and II. Type I tumors are 
      estrogen-related, low-grade endometrioid tumors, whereas type II tumors are
      aggressive, high-grade non-endometrioid tumors. Ret finger protein is a nuclear
      transcription factor with a tripartite motif that is highly expressed in
      different tumor cells. MATERIAL AND METHOD: To analyze the expression of ret
      finger protein in endometrial tissues and cancer, 18 cases of secretory and
      proliferative endometrium, endometrial polyp, endometrial hyperplasia and
      endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia and 21 cases of types I and II endometrial 
      carcinoma were evaluated immunohistochemically. RESULTS: Although rare cases of
      secretory endometrium showed a weak focal nuclear positivity, remaining
      proliferative endometrium, endometrial hyperplasia and type I endometrioid cancer
      cases were negative. In contrast, all cases of serous cancers showed strong
      nuclear positivity. After these strong positive results for serous endometrial
      cancer, 12 more cases of ovarian and endometrial serous carcinoma cases were
      added to the study. All of the additional cases were also strongly positive for
      ret finger protein. CONCLUSION: We suggest that ret finger protein might play a
      role in the carcinogenesis of the serous tumors of gynecological system and can
      be used to differentiate serous carcinomas from other epithelial tumors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: According to the widely accepted pathway, a serous borderline tumor
      becomes invasive either by progressing into a noninvasive micropapillary tumor or
      directly through microinvasion. Our objective was to investigate the role of
      serous borderline tumors and their accompanying extraovarian lesions in
      pathogenesis of serous ovarian cancer using immunohistochemistry as a tool.
      MATERIAL AND METHOD: An immunohistochemical panel of p16, p53, CD24, EpCAM and
      calretinin was applied to cutting edge matrix assembly-like tissue arrays of 46
      cases consisting of typical, focal micropapillary, micropapillary, microinvasive,
      cystadenoma, and low-grade carcinoma cases. These tissue arrays are better
      choices than conventional tissue arrays to examine thin walled and heterogenous
      neoplasia like serous borderline tumors as they facilitate the analysis with
      linear sections rather than a core. RESULTS: For two tumor supressor gene
      markers; no diffuse and strong expression of p53, and strong and
      patchy/heterogenous expression of p16 were detected in all cases. Focal and
      strong calretinin expression was detected in micropapillary tumors while
      expression of EpCAM was lost in the same areas. Strong cytoplasmic CD24
      expression was detected in cases with peritoneal implants, favoring the theory
      that change of expression localization of cell adhesion molecules is in
      accordance with phenotypical changes and tumor progresssion. Furthermore,
      circumfrential membranous and cytoplasmic expression of CD24 and EpCAM was
      detected in neoplastic cells in lymph nodes and microinvasion areas. CONCLUSION: 
      Our results show that different levels of serous ovarian tumor progression are
      accompanied by changes in the immunohistochemical expression pattern of EpCAM,
      CD24, and calretinin.

TI  - Lipid-functionalized dextran nanosystems to overcome multidrug resistance in
      cancer: a pilot study.
PG  - 915-25
LID - 10.1007/s11999-012-2610-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The toxicity of anticancer agents and the difficulty in delivering
      drugs selectively to tumor cells pose a challenge in overcoming multidrug
      resistance (MDR). Recently, nanotechnology has emerged as a powerful tool in
      addressing some of the barriers to drug delivery, including MDR in cancer, by
      utilizing alternate routes of cellular entry and targeted delivery of drugs and
      genes. However, it is unclear whether doxorubicin (Dox) can be delivered by
      nanotechnologic approaches. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether (1) Dox-loaded
      lipid-functionalized dextran-based biocompatible nanoparticles (Dox/NP) can
      reverse MDR, (2) Dox/NP has more potent cytotoxic effect on MDR tumors than
      poly(ethylene glycol)-modified liposomal Dox (PLD), and (3) multidrug resistance 
      protein 1 (MDR1) small interfering RNA loaded in these nanoparticles (siMDR1/NP) 
      can modulate MDR. METHODS: To create stable Dox/NP and siMDR1/NP, we used two
      different lipid-modified dextran derivatives. The effect of Dox or Dox/NP was
      tested on drug-sensitive osteosarcoma (KHOS) and ovarian cancer (SKOV-3) cell
      cultures in triplicate and their respective MDR counterparts KHOS(R2) and
      SKOV-3(TR) in triplicate. We determined the effects on drug retention,
      transfection efficacy of siMDR1/NP, and P-glycoprotein expression and the
      antiproliferative effect between Dox/NP and PLD in MDR tumor cells. RESULTS:
      Fluorescence microscopy revealed efficient uptake of the Dox/NP and fluorescently
      tagged siMDR1/NP. Dox/NP showed five- to 10-fold higher antiproliferative
      activity at the 50% inhibitory concentration than free Dox in tumor cells. Dox/NP
      showed twofold higher activity than PLD in MDR tumor cells. siMDR1/NP (100 nM)
      suppressed P-glycoprotein expression in KHOS(R2). CONCLUSIONS: Dextran-lipid
      nanoparticles are a promising platform for delivering Dox and siRNAs. CLINICAL
      RELEVANCE: Biocompatible dextran-based nanoparticles that are directly
      translatable to clinical medicine may lead to new potential therapeutics for
      reversing MDR in patients with cancer.

TI  - Molecular patterns in the evolution of serrated lesion of the colorectum.
PG  - 1800-10
LID - 10.1002/ijc.27869 [doi]
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) mostly develops from a variety of polyps following mainly
      three different molecular pathways: chromosomal instability (CIN), microsatellite
      instability (MSI) and CpG island methylation (CIMP). Polyps are classified
      histologically as conventional adenomas, hyperplastic polyps, sessile serrated
      adenomas/polyps (SSA/P) and traditional serrated adenomas (TSA). However, the
      association of these polyps with the different types of CRCs and the underlying
      genetic and epigenetic aberrations has yet to be resolved. In order to address
      this question we analyzed 140 tumors and 20 matched mucosae by array comparative 
      genomic hybridization, by sequence analysis of the oncogenes BRAF, KRAS, PI3K3CA 
      and by methylation arrays. MSI was tested indirectly by immunohistochemistry
      (IHC) and a loss of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 was assigned as high microsatellite 
      instability (MSI-H), while low microsatellite instability (MSI-L) was defined as 
      MGMT IHC negativity only. CIN was detected in 78% of all MSI-H CRCs, most
      commonly as a gain of chromosome 8. Methylation data analyses allowed
      classification of samples into four groups and detected similar methylation
      profiles in SSA/P and MSI-H CRC. TSA also revealed aberrant methylation pattern, 
      but clustered more heterogeneously and closer to microsatellite stable (MSS)
      CRCs. SSA/P, TSA and MSI-H CRCs had the highest degree of promotor methylation
      (CIMP pathway). Chromosomal instability, in contrast to the established doctrine,
      is a common phenomenon in MSI CRCs, yet to a lower extent and at later stages
      than in MSS CRCs. Methylation analyses suggest that SSA/P are precursors for
      MSI-H CRCs and follow the CIMP pathway.

TI  - Functional effect of polymorphisms in 15q25 locus on CHRNA5 mRNA, bulky DNA
      adducts and TP53 mutations.
PG  - 1811-20
LID - 10.1002/ijc.27870 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies have demonstrated that genetic polymorphisms
      influence the risk of developing lung cancer. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
      alpha3, alpha5 and beta4 genes (CHRNA3, CHRNA5 and CHRNB4) cluster at the 15q25.1
      lung cancer susceptibility locus. We genotyped 310 patients with non-small cell
      lung cancer and a control group of 348 cancer-free individuals for seven sequence
      variants located in CHRNA3 and CHRNA5 genes. Two of the polymorphisms (rs3829787 
      and rs3841324) statistically influenced the risk of developing lung cancer. We
      found that four of the variants (rs3829787, rs3841324, rs588765 and rs3743073)
      were associated with differential levels of genetic alterations measured as the
      levels of hydrophobic DNA adducts in the adjacent histologically normal tissue of
      the lung cancer patients and as TP53 mutations in their lung tumors. The seven
      sequence variants formed three haplotypes with a frequency above 5%. The two most
      frequent haplotypes were associated with the risk of developing lung cancer and
      with smoking-related DNA alterations. We also found an association between CHRNA5
      mRNA levels and the sequence variants or haplotypes. In conclusion, our results
      showed that several of the polymorphisms and their haplotypes in CHRNA5/CHRNA3
      genes may have functional effects on (i) CHRNA5 mRNA levels, (ii) polycyclic
      aromatic hydrocarbon-DNA adduct levels, (iii) TP53 mutations and (iv)
      susceptibility to lung cancer.

      deubiquitinating enzymes.
PG  - 2251-8
LID - 10.1002/cbic.201200497 [doi]
AB  - Epitope-tagged active-site-directed probes are widely used to visualize the
      activity of deubiquitinases (DUBs) in cell extracts, to investigate the
      specificity and potency of small-molecule DUB inhibitors, and to isolate and
      identify DUBs by mass spectrometry. With DUBs arising as novel potential drug
      targets, probes are required that can be produced in sufficient amounts and to
      meet the specific needs of a given experiment. The established method for the
      generation of DUB probes makes use of labor-intensive intein-based methods that
      have inherent limitations concerning the incorporation of unnatural amino acids
      and the amount of material that can be obtained. Here, we describe the total
      chemical synthesis of active-site-directed probes and their application to
      activity-based profiling and identification of functional DUBs. This synthetic
      methodology allowed the easy incorporation of desired tags for specific
      applications, for example, fluorescent reporters, handles for immunoprecipitation
      or affinity pull-down, and cleavable linkers. Additionally, the synthetic method 
      can be scaled up to provide significant amounts of probe. Fluorescent ubiquitin
      probes allowed faster, in-gel detection of active DUBs, as compared to
      (immuno)blotting procedures. A biotinylated probe holding a photocleavable linker
      enabled the affinity pull-down and subsequent mild, photorelease of DUBs. Also,
      DUB activity levels were monitored in response to overexpression or knockdown,
      and to inhibition by small molecules. Furthermore, fluorescent probes revealed
      differential DUB activity profiles in a panel of lung and prostate cancer cells.

      in preclinical and clinical studies against solid tumors; they often fall short
      and activate nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkappaB). Co-administration of HDACI with
      proteasome inhibitors (PIs), which interrupt NFkappaB pathways, may enhance
      HDACI-lethality. The goal of this study was to determine whether PIs could
      potentiate HDACI, scriptaid (SCP)-mediated lethality, to unravel the associated
      mechanisms and to assess the effects of the combined inhibition of HDAC and
      proteasome on chemotherapy response in human colorectal cancer cells. Cancer
      cells were exposed to agents alone or in combination; cell growth inhibition was 
      determined by MTT and colony formation assays. HDAC-, proteasome-,
      NFkappaB-activities, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified. Induction
      of apoptosis and cell cycle alterations were monitored by flow cytometry.
      Expression of cell cycle/apoptosis and cytoprotective/stress-related genes was
      determined by real-time qRT-PCR and EIA, respectively. Potentiation of cancer
      cell sensitivity to chemotherapies by SCP/PIs was also evaluated. SCP and PIs:
      MG132, PI-1, or epoxomicin interact synergistically to potently inhibit cancer
      cell growth, alter cell cycle, induce apoptosis, reduce NFkappaB activity, and
      increase ROS generation. These events are associated with multiple perturbations 
      in the expression of cell cycle, apoptosis, cytoprotective, and stress-related
      genes. Co-administration of SCP and PIs strikingly increases the chemosensitivity
      of cancer cells (122-2 x 10(5)-fold) in a drug and SCP/PIs-dependent manner. This
      combination regimen markedly reduced the doses of chemotherapies with potent
      anticancer effects and less toxicity. A strategy combining HDAC/proteasome
      inhibition with chemotherapies warrants further investigation in colorectal
      cancer.

TI  - Elderly patients with colon cancer have unique tumor characteristics and poor
      survival.
PG  - 739-47
LID - 10.1002/cncr.27753 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of colon cancer increases with age, and colon cancer
      predominantly affects individuals >65 years old. However, there are limited data 
      regarding clinical and pathologic factors, treatment characteristics, and
      survival of older patients with colon cancer. The objective of this study was to 
      determine the effects of increasing age on colon cancer. METHODS: Patients
      diagnosed with colon cancer between 1988 and 2006 were identified through the Los
      Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program, in Southern California. Patients were
      stratified into 4 age groups: 18-49, 50-64, 65-79, and >/=80 years. Clinical and 
      pathologic characteristics and disease-specific and overall survival were
      compared between patients from different age groups. RESULTS: A total of 32,819
      patients were assessed. Patients aged 18 to 49 and 65 to 79 years represented the
      smallest and largest groups, respectively. A near equal number of males and
      females were diagnosed with colon cancer in the 3 youngest age groups, whereas
      patients who were >/=80 years old were more commonly white and female. Tumor
      location was different between groups, and the frequency of larger tumors (>5 cm)
      was greatest in youngest patients (18-49 years). The oldest patients (>/=80
      years) were administered chemotherapy at the lowest frequency, and
      disease-specific and overall survival rates decreased with increasing age.
      CONCLUSIONS: This investigation demonstrates that older age is associated with
      alterations in clinical and pathologic characteristics and decreased survival.
      This suggests that the phenotype of colon cancer and the efficacy of colon cancer
      therapies may be dependent on the age of patients.

TI  - Simulation of the mutation F76del on the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor
      protein: mechanism of the disease and implications for drug development.
PG  - 349-63
LID - 10.1002/prot.24191 [doi]
AB  - The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) plays a central role in the
      oxygen-sensing pathway by regulating the degradation of the hypoxia-inducible
      factor (HIF-1alpha). The capture of HIF-1alpha by pVHL is regulated by an
      oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of a specific conserved prolyl residue. The VHL
      gene is mutated in the von Hippel-Lindau cancer predisposition syndrome, which is
      characterized by the development of highly vascularized tumors and is associated 
      with constitutively high levels of HIF-1alpha. The disturbance of the dynamic
      coupling between HIF-1alpha and pVHL bearing the commonly found mutation F76del
      was experimentally confirmed but the mechanism of such complex disruption is
      still not clear. Performing unbiased molecular dynamics simulations, we show that
      the F76del mutation may enlarge the HIF binding pocket in pVHL and induce the
      formation of an internal cavity in the hydrophobic core of the beta-domain, which
      can lead to a partial destabilization of the beta-sheets S1, S4, and S7 and a
      consequent loss of hydrogen bonds with a conserved recognition motif in HIF. The 
      newly formed cavity has a significant druggability score and may be a suitable
      target for stabilizing ligands. Studies of this nature may help to fill the
      information gap between genotype-phenotype correlations with details obtained at 
      atomic level and provide basis for future development of drug candidates, such as
      pharmacological chaperones, with the specific aim of reverting the dysfunction of
      such pathological protein complexes found in patients with VHL.

TI  - Predictors of newly diagnosed cancer patients' understanding of the goals of
      their care at initiation of chemotherapy.
PG  - 691-9
LID - 10.1002/cncr.27787 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The American Society of Clinical Oncology Quality Oncology Practice
      Initiative endorses in their core measures that providers should discuss the
      goals of care (GOC) at the time of chemotherapy consent. GOC refers to
      chemotherapy treatment intent: cure versus noncure. In this study, the authors
      sought to determine whether attributes of patients and initial patient-physician 
      encounters were associated with patients' understanding of their GOC. METHODS: In
      total, the authors surveyed 125 consecutive, newly diagnosed patients who were
      receiving chemotherapy for solid malignancies at a single academic cancer center 
      and performed a medical record review for additional data. Patient understanding 
      of their oncologist's GOC and oncologist's reported GOC were compared. The
      primary outcome was concordance of patient-physician dyads regarding the GOC
      (cure vs noncure). RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five of 137 of eligible patients
      (91%) completed the survey. Only 95 of 125 patient-physician pairs (75%)
      patient-physician pairs were concordant regarding the GOC. In a multivariable
      logistic regression, both older patients (odds ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence
      interval, 0.08-0.57) and non-native English speakers had an almost 80% lower odds
      (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.93) of GOC concordance
      compared with younger patients and native English speakers. Patients who received
      printed chemotherapy information during the patient-physician consent process had
      almost 3 times greater odds (odds ratio, 2.88; 95% confidence interval,
      1.24-6.68) of GOC concordance with their physician compared with those who did
      not receive materials. CONCLUSIONS: Patient misunderstanding of GOC was
      substantial, with 25% of cancer patients misunderstanding the goal of their
      chemotherapy treatment. Key predictors of GOC misunderstanding included factors
      that potentially were amenable to interventions at the time of chemotherapy
      consent.

TI  - Prognostic factors for recurrence and survival in anal cancer: generating
      hypotheses from the mature outcomes of the first United Kingdom Coordinating
      Committee on Cancer Research Anal Cancer Trial (ACT I).
PG  - 748-55
LID - 10.1002/cncr.27825 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Only 2 prospective studies have previously reported prognostic
      factors for anal cancer, European Organization for Research and Treatment of
      Cancer trial 22861 (EORTC 22861) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trial 98-11
      (RTOG 98-11). Both of those trials reported that clinically positive lymph nodes 
      and male sex predicted poorer overall survival (OS). The EORTC 22861 trial
      indicated that the same factors were prognostic for locoregional control. In the 
      current report, the authors investigated potential prognostic factors from the
      first United Kingdom Coordinating Committee on Cancer Research Anal Cancer Trial 
      (ACT I), in which patients were randomized to receive either radiotherapy alone
      or chemoradiation (CRT) with concurrent 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin C. METHODS: In
      the ACT I trial, associations between several baseline characteristics and 3
      endpoints were investigated: locoregional failure (LRF), anal cancer death (ACD),
      and OS. The analyses were restricted to 292 patients who received CRT, which
      subsequently became standard treatment. A score was derived using multivariable
      Cox regression to identify the set of factors that, together, had the best
      prognostic performance. This score was then validated with a large, independent
      prospective trial (the ACT II trial). RESULTS: Palpable, clinically positive
      lymph nodes were associated with LRF (P = .012), a greater risk of ACD (P =
      .031), and decreased OS (P = .006) in multivariable analyses. Men had worse
      outcomes than women for LRF (P = .036), ACD (P = .039), and OS (P = .008). On
      average, a lower hemoglobin level had an adverse effect on ACD (P = .008), and a 
      higher white blood cell count had an adverse effect on OS (P = .001). However,
      external validation of the score was poor for LRF (area under the curve [AUC] =
      54%) but was better for ACD (AUC = 67%) and OS (AUC = 63%). CONCLUSIONS: The
      results from this analysis of the ACT I trial supported evidence for palpable
      lymph nodes and male sex as prognostic factors for LRF and OS, and lower
      hemoglobin levels and a higher white blood cell count were identified as
      prognostic factors for ACD and OS, respectively.

      2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer by race/ethnicity and education within the
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network.
PG  - 839-46
LID - 10.1002/cncr.27831 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      (HER2)-positive breast cancer is highly efficacious yet costly and
      time-intensive, and few data are available about its use. The authors of this
      report examined receipt and completion of adjuvant trastuzumab by race/ethnicity 
      and education for women with HER2-positive disease. METHODS: The National
      Comprehensive Cancer Network Breast Cancer Outcomes Database was used to identify
      1109 women who were diagnosed with stage I through III, HER2-positive breast
      cancer during September 2005 through December 2008 and were followed for >/=1
      year. The authors used multivariable logistic regression to assess the
      association of race/ethnicity and education with the receipt of trastuzumab and, 
      among those women who initiated trastuzumab, with the completion of > 270 days of
      therapy. RESULTS: The cohort was 75% white, 8% black, and 9% Hispanic; and 20% of
      women had attained a high school degree or less. Most women (83%) received
      trastuzumab, and no significant differences were observed according to
      race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Among the women who initiated
      trastuzumab, 73% of black women versus 87% of white women (P = .007) and 70% of
      women with less than a high school education versus 90% of women with a college
      degree completed > 270 days of therapy (P = .006). In adjusted analyses, black
      women (vs white women) and women without a high school degree (vs those with a
      college degree) had lower odds of completing therapy (black women: odds ratio,
      0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-074; white women: odds ratio, 0.27, 95%
      confidence interval, 0.14-0.51). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in completing
      trastuzumab therapy were observed according to race and educational attainment
      among women who received treatment at National Comprehensive Cancer Network
      centers. Efforts to assure the appropriate use of trastuzumab and to understand
      treatment barriers are needed and may lead to improved outcomes. The authors
      report differences in the rate at which patients complete treatment with
      trastuzumab according to race and education among women who receive treatment at 
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network centers. Efforts to assure the appropriate 
      use of trastuzumab and to understand treatment barriers are needed and may lead
      to improved outcomes.

AB  - Hereby we present the synthesis of several ruthenium(II) and ruthenium(III)
      dithiocarbamato complexes. Proceeding from the Na[trans-Ru(III)(dmso)(2)Cl(4)]
      (2) and cis-[Ru(II)(dmso)(4)Cl(2)] (3) precursors, the diamagnetic, mixed-ligand 
      [Ru(II)L(2)(dmso)(2)] complexes 4 and 5, the paramagnetic, neutral [Ru(III)L(3)] 
      monomers 6 and 7, the antiferromagnetically coupled ionic
      alpha-[Ru(III)(2)L(5)]Cl complexes 8 and 9 as well as the beta-[Ru(III)(2)L(5)]Cl
      dinuclear species 10 and 11 (L = dimethyl- (DMDT) and pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate 
      (PDT)) were obtained. All the compounds were fully characterised by elemental
      analysis as well as (1)H NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. Moreover, for the first time 
      the crystal structures of the dinuclear
      beta-[Ru(III)(2)(dmdt)(5)]BF(4)CHCl(3)CH(3)CN and of the novel
      [Ru(II)L(2)(dmso)(2)] complexes were also determined and discussed. For both the 
      mono- and dinuclear Ru(II) and Ru(III) complexes the central metal atoms assume a
      distorted octahedral geometry. Furthermore, in vitro cytotoxicity of the
      complexes has been evaluated on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) NCI-H1975
      cells. All the mono- and dinuclear Ru(III) dithiocarbamato compounds (i.e.,
      complexes 6-10) show interesting cytotoxic activity, up to one order of magnitude
      higher with respect to cisplatin. Otherwise, no significant antiproliferative
      effect for either the precursors 2 and 3 or the Ru(II) complexes 4 and 5 has been
      observed.

TI  - Endoscopic submucosal dissection or transanal endoscopic microsurgery for
      nonpolypoid rectal high grade dysplasia and submucosa-invading rectal cancer.
PG  - 1031-6
LID - 10.1055/s-0032-1310015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) has been shown
      to be highly effective for early rectal cancer, and endoscopic submucosal
      dissection (ESD) has been introduced to treat noninvasive colorectal neoplasia.
      The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of ESD and TEM for superficial 
      early rectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 63
      patients with nonpolypoid rectal high grade dysplasia or submucosa-invading
      cancer who were treated with ESD or TEM, and compared clinical outcomes and
      safety between the treatment groups. RESULTS: 30 patients underwent ESD and 33
      underwent TEM. For ESD compared with TEM, en bloc resection rates were 96.7% vs. 
      100% (P = 0.476) and R0 resection rates were 96.7 % vs. 97.0 % (P = 1.000). There
      were no cases of local recurrence or distant metastasis in either group.
      Antibiotics were required in 11 patients (36.7%) in the ESD group and 33 (100%)
      in the TEM group (P < 0.001). There was no difference in net procedure time
      although ESD was associated with shorter total procedure time and hospital stay
      than TEM, with mean (standard deviation [SD]) 84.0 (51.2) vs. 116.4 (58.5) min (P
      = 0.0023), and 3.6 (1.2) vs. 6.6 (3.5) days (P < 0.001), respectively. There were
      no significant differences in complications between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Both ESD and TEM are effective and oncologically safe for treating nonpolypoid
      rectal high grade dysplasia and submucosa-invading cancers. ESD has the
      additional advantages of minimal invasiveness and avoidance of anesthesia.
      Therefore, ESD could be recommended as a treatment option for superficial early
      rectal cancers.

TI  - Inhibiting aurora kinases reduces tumor growth and suppresses tumor recurrence
      after chemotherapy in patient-derived triple-negative breast cancer xenografts.
PG  - 2693-703
LID - 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0441-T [doi]
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) have an aggressive phenotype with a
      relatively high rate of recurrence and poor overall survival. To date, there is
      no approved targeted therapy for TNBCs. Aurora kinases act as regulators of
      mammalian cell division. They are important for cell-cycle progression and are
      frequently overexpressed or mutated in human tumors, including breast cancer. In 
      this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting Aurora kinases
      in preclinical models of human breast cancers using a pan-inhibitor of Aurora
      kinases, AS703569. In vitro, AS703569 was tested in 15 human breast cancer cell
      lines. TNBC cell lines were more sensitive to AS703569 than were other types of
      breast cancer cells. Inhibition of proliferation was associated with cell-cycle
      arrest, aneuploidy, and apoptosis. In vivo, AS703569 administered alone
      significantly inhibited tumor growth in seven of 11 patient-derived breast cancer
      xenografts. Treatment with AS703569 was associated with a decrease of
      phospho-histone H3 expression. Finally, AS703569 combined to
      doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide significantly inhibited in vivo tumor recurrence,
      suggesting that Aurora kinase inhibitors could be used both in monotherapy and in
      combination settings. In conclusion, these data indicate that targeting Aurora
      kinases could represent a new effective approach for TNBC treatment.

      multiple myeloma.
PG  - 2600-9
LID - 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0605 [doi]
AB  - Multiple myeloma is an entity of cytogenetically and genetically heterogenous
      plasma cell neoplasms. Despite recent improvement in the treatment outcome of
      multiple myeloma by novel molecular-targeted chemotherapeutics, multiple myeloma 
      remains incurable. The identification of a therapeutic target molecule in which
      various signaling for cell-survival converge is a core component for the
      development of new therapeutic strategies against multiple myeloma. RSK2 is an
      essential mediator of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway for cell survival and
      proliferation. In this study, we discovered that RSK2(Ser227), which is located
      at the N-terminal kinase domain and is one site responsible for substrate
      phosphorylation, is activated through phosphorylation regardless of the type of
      cytogenetic abnormalities or upstream molecular signaling in all 12 multiple
      myeloma-derived cell lines examined and 6 of 9 patient-derived CD138-positive
      primary myeloma cells. The chemical inhibition of RSK2(Ser227) by BI-D1870 or
      gene knockdown of RSK2 inhibits myeloma cell proliferation through apoptosis
      induction, and this anti-myeloma effect was accompanied by downregulation of
      c-MYC, cyclin D, p21(WAF1/CIP1), and MCL1. RSK2(Ser227) inhibition resulting from
      BI-D1870 treatment restored lenalidomide-induced direct cytotoxicity of myeloma
      cells from interleukin-6-mediated cell protection, showed no cross-resistance to 
      bortezomib, and exerted additive/synergistic antiproliferative effects in
      conjunction with the mTOR, histone deacetylase, and BH3-mimicking BCL2/BCLX(L)
      inhibitors. These results suggest that RSK2(Ser227) is a potential therapeutic
      target not only for newly diagnosed but also for patients with later phase
      multiple myeloma who are resistant or refractory to currently available
      anti-myeloma therapies.

TI  - Targeting the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins as a novel therapeutic strategy in 
      medulloblastoma.
PG  - 2654-63
LID - 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0352 [doi]
AB  - Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood. Novel
      therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to overcome cytotoxic resistance. We
      hypothesized that antiapoptotic signals contribute to resistance and that
      treatment with proapoptotic agents could increase the efficacy of conventional
      therapies. A PCR array was used to assess the status of the apoptotic signaling
      pathway in medulloblastoma cells after treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
      Treatment with cisplatin led to the upregulation of antiapoptotic signals,
      including inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP), in medulloblastoma cells. We
      subsequently investigated the synergistic effect of a small-molecule IAP
      inhibitor, LBW242, in combination with cisplatin and/or radiotherapy in three
      human medulloblastoma cell lines and 5 short term primary patient medulloblastoma
      cultures. The addition of LBW242 to chemotherapy resulted in significantly
      increased antitumor activity with a similar effect observed in combination with
      radiotherapy. Measurement of caspase-8 and -9 activity indicated that the synergy
      resulted from induction of both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways.
      Apoptosis was confirmed by Annexin V staining and activation of caspases 3/7.
      Xenograft models were used to evaluate the mechanism of action and efficacy in
      vivo. The combination therapy significantly reduced the tumor burden in a
      medulloblastoma xenograft model and TUNEL analysis in a medulloblastoma
      orthograft confirmed in vivo induction of apoptosis. These findings support the
      strategy of targeting IAPs in combination with cytotoxic therapy as a novel
      treatment strategy for patients with medulloblastoma.

TI  - Targeting KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer with the Hsp90 inhibitor
      ganetespib.
PG  - 2633-43

AB  - Mutant KRAS is a feature of more than 25% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) 
      and represents one of the most prevalent oncogenic drivers in this disease. NSCLC
      tumors with oncogenic KRAS respond poorly to current therapies, necessitating the
      pursuit of new treatment strategies. Targeted inhibition of the molecular
      chaperone Hsp90 results in the coordinated blockade of multiple oncogenic
      signaling pathways in tumor cells and has thus emerged as an attractive avenue
      for therapeutic intervention in human malignancies. Here, we examined the
      activity of ganetespib, a small-molecule inhibitor of Hsp90 currently in clinical
      trials for NSCLCs in a panel of lung cancer cell lines harboring a diverse
      spectrum of KRAS mutations. In vitro, ganetespib was potently cytotoxic in all
      lines, with concomitant destabilization of KRAS signaling effectors. Combinations
      of low-dose ganetespib with MEK or PI3K/mTOR inhibitors resulted in superior
      cytotoxic activity than single agents alone in a subset of mutant KRAS cells, and
      the antitumor efficacy of ganetespib was potentiated by cotreatment with the
      PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 in A549 xenografts in vivo. At the molecular level,
      ganetespib suppressed activating feedback signaling loops that occurred in
      response to MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition, although this activity was not the sole
      determinant of combinatorial benefit. In addition, ganetespib sensitized mutant
      KRAS NSCLC cells to standard-of-care chemotherapeutics of the antimitotic,
      topoisomerase inhibitor, and alkylating agent classes. Taken together, these data
      underscore the promise of ganetespib as a single-agent or combination treatment
      in KRAS-driven lung tumors.

TI  - ESMO Consensus Guidelines for management of patients with colon and rectal
      cancer. a personalized approach to clinical decision making.
PG  - 2479-516
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common tumour type in both sexes combined in 
      Western countries. Although screening programmes including the implementation of 
      faecal occult blood test and colonoscopy might be able to reduce mortality by
      removing precursor lesions and by making diagnosis at an earlier stage, the
      burden of disease and mortality is still high. Improvement of diagnostic and
      treatment options increased staging accuracy, functional outcome for early stages
      as well as survival. Although high quality surgery is still the mainstay of
      curative treatment, the management of CRC must be a multi-modal approach
      performed by an experienced multi-disciplinary expert team. Optimal choice of the
      individual treatment modality according to disease localization and extent,
      tumour biology and patient factors is able to maintain quality of life, enables
      long-term survival and even cure in selected patients by a combination of
      chemotherapy and surgery. Treatment decisions must be based on the available
      evidence, which has been the basis for this consensus conference-based guideline 
      delivering a clear proposal for diagnostic and treatment measures in each stage
      of rectal and colon cancer and the individual clinical situations. This ESMO
      guideline is recommended to be used as the basis for treatment and management
      decisions.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the epidemiology and trends in eyelid malignancies in
      Singapore from 1996 to 2008. METHODS: The Singapore Cancer Registry has been
      collecting epidemiological data of all cancers seen in Singapore since 1968. Data
      of all eyelid cancers from 1996 to 2008 were retrieved for analysis. The
      age-standardised incidence rates and age-specific incidence rates were calculated
      with the direct method, using the 2000 world population as a standard. RESULTS:
      There were a total of 160 male patients (48%) and 173 female patients (52%). The 
      median age at diagnosis was 66 years (range 31-95) for male subjects and 67 years
      (35-99) for female subjects. The average annual age-standardised incidence rate
      of all eyelid cancers over the 13 years was 5.0 per million. A significant
      decrease in rates from 6.6 per million in the 1996-1998 period to 3.9 per million
      in the 2005-2008 period with an annual percentage change of 3.6% (95% CI -6.5 to 
      0.7%; p=0.02) was noted for women. The most common cancer was basal cell
      carcinoma (82%), followed by sebaceous gland carcinoma (11%) and squamous cell
      carcinoma (4%). CONCLUSIONS: The annual age-standardised incidence rates for male
      and female residents showed a steady decline over the last 13 years. These data
      suggest that factors related to sun protection have resulted in reduced eyelid
      cancers over time and provide a basis for such public health programmes
      elsewhere.

PG  - 16-25
LID - 10.1177/1933719112459244 [doi]
AB  - Potential roles of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists on GnRH/GnRH
      receptor systems and their effects on the extrapituitary tissues are largely
      elusive. In this narrated review, we summarized the systemic effects of GnRH
      antagonists on ovary, endometrium, embryo implantation, placental development,
      fetal teratogenicity, reproductive tissue cancer cells, and heart while briefly
      reviewing the GnRH and GnRH receptor system. GnRH antagonists may have direct
      effects on ovarian granulosa cells. Data are conflicting regarding their effects 
      on endometrial receptivity. The GnRH antagonists may potentially have detrimental
      effect on early placentation by decreasing the invasive ability of
      cytotrophoblasts if the exposure to them occurs during early pregnancy. The GnRH 
      antagonists were not found to increase the rates of congenital malformations.
      Comparative clinical data are required to explore their systemic effects on
      various extrapituitary tissues such as on cardiac function in the long term as
      well as their potential use in other human cancers that express GnRH receptors.

TI  - Alterations of microRNA expression patterns in human cervical carcinoma cells (Ca
      Ski) toward 1'S-1'-acetoxychavicol acetate and cisplatin.
PG  - 567-78
LID - 10.1177/1933719112459220 [doi]
AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate the combined effects of a natural
      compound 1'S-1'-acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA) with cisplatin (CDDP) on
      HPV-positive human cervical carcinoma cell lines (Ca Ski-low cisplatin
      sensitivity and HeLa-high cisplatin sensitivity), and to identify microRNAs
      (miRNAs) modulated in response toward ACA and/or CDDP. It was revealed that both 
      ACA and CDDP induced dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity when used as a
      stand-alone agent, while synergistic effects were observed when used in
      combination with a combination index (CI) value of 0.74 +/- 0.01 and 0.85 +/-
      0.01 in Ca Ski and HeLa cells, respectively. A total of 25 miRNAs were found to
      be significantly differentially expressed in response to ACA and/or CDDP. These
      include hsa-miR-138, hsa-miR-210, and hsa-miR-744 with predicted gene targets
      involved in signaling pathways regulating apoptosis and cell cycle progression.
      In conclusion, ACA acts as a chemosensitizer which synergistically potentiates
      the cytotoxic effect of CDDP in cervical cancer cells. The altered miRNA
      expression upon administration of ACA and/or CDDP suggests that miRNAs play an
      important role in anticancer drug responses, which can be manipulated for
      therapeutic purposes.

      commonly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with poor survival,
      leading to efforts to develop FLT3 kinase inhibitors. However, FLT3 inhibitors
      have thus far met with limited success, inducing only a clearance of peripheral
      blasts with minimal BM responses. Quizartinib is a novel potent and selective
      FLT3 inhibitor currently being studied in clinical trials. In 13 of 14 FLT3/ITD
      AML patients with normal karyotype treated with quizartinib, we observed terminal
      myeloid differentiation of BM blasts in association with a clinical
      differentiation syndrome. The single patient whose blasts failed to differentiate
      had a preexisting C/EBPalpha mutation and another developed a C/EBPalpha mutation
      at disease progression, suggesting a mechanism of resistance to FLT3 inhibition. 
      In vitro, in primary blasts cocultured with human BM stroma, FLT3 inhibition with
      quizartinib induced cell-cycle arrest and differentiation rather than apoptosis. 
      The present study is the first description of terminal differentiation of cancer 
      cells in patients treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. These data highlight 
      the importance of the differentiation block in the patho-genesis of AML.

TI  - Targeting the unique methylation pattern of androgen receptor (AR) promoter in
      prostate stem/progenitor cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA) leads to
      suppressed prostate tumorigenesis.
PG  - 39954-66
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M112.395574 [doi]
AB  - Androgen receptor (AR) expression surveys found that normal prostate/prostate
      cancer (PCa) stem/progenitor cells, but not embryonic or mesenchymal stem cells, 
      expressed little AR with high methylation in the AR promoter. Mechanism
      dissection revealed that the differential methylation pattern in the AR promoter 
      could be due to differential expression of methyltransferases and binding of
      methylation binding protein to the AR promoter region. The low expression of AR
      in normal prostate/PCa stem/progenitor cells was reversed after adding
      5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a demethylating agent, which could then lead to decreased
      stemness and drive cells into a more differentiated status, suggesting that the
      methylation in the AR promoter of prostate stem/progenitor cells is critical not 
      only in maintaining the stemness but also critical in protection of cells from
      differentiation. Furthermore, induced AR expression, via alteration of its
      methylation pattern, led to suppression of the self-renewal/proliferation of
      prostate stem/progenitor cells and PCa tumorigenesis in both in vitro assays and 
      in vivo orthotopic xenografted mouse studies. Taken together, these data prove
      the unique methylation pattern of AR promoter in normal prostate/PCa
      stem/progenitor cells and the influence of AR on their renewal/proliferation and 
      differentiation. Targeting PCa stem/progenitor cells with alteration of
      methylated AR promoter status might provide a new potential therapeutic approach 
      to battle PCa because the PCa stem/progenitor cells have high tumorigenicity.

TI  - Intranasal fentanyl spray: a novel dosage form for the treatment of breakthrough 
      cancer pain.
PG  - 1382-91
LID - 10.1345/aph.1R069 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy,
      adverse events, dosing, and administration of intranasal fentanyl spray in the
      treatment of breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP) in adults. DATA SOURCES: Relevant
      published data were identified using PubMed from inception to April 2012 using
      the search terms fentanyl nasal spray, intranasal fentanyl, intranasal fentanyl
      cancer pain, and fentanyl pectin cancer pain. Only articles evaluating the use of
      intranasal fentanyl spray for cancer pain were selected. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA
      EXTRACTION: All articles evaluating the pharmacokinetics of intranasal fentanyl
      or the clinical efficacy of intranasal fentanyl spray for the treatment of BTCP
      were considered; references of selected articles were manually reviewed to
      identify further articles. The manufacturer of intranasal fentanyl spray was also
      contacted to obtain information. DATA SYNTHESIS: Intranasal fentanyl spray gained
      Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of BTCP in adults with
      cancer receiving stable background opioid therapy for chronic pain. In doses
      ranging from 100 to 800 mug/spray, intranasal fentanyl spray was found to be more
      effective than placebo and more effective than oral morphine or oral fentanyl
      formulations in reducing pain for up to 15-45 minutes; onset of analgesia was
      also improved with intranasal fentanyl spray. The most commonly observed adverse 
      events included nausea, vomiting, vertigo, and dizziness. CONCLUSIONS: For the
      treatment of BTCP, intranasal fentanyl spray offers improved onset of analgesia
      compared to other oral therapies; this improved onset of analgesia may closely
      mimic the typical time course of a BTCP episode. Nasal administration may
      overcome problems such as nausea, vomiting, or xerostomia that may complicate
      oral administration of analgesics. Potential disadvantages include uncertainty in
      treating more than 4 BTCP episodes per 24 hours and a higher cost compared to
      generically available oral opioid analgesics.

TI  - CD24 expression is important in male urothelial tumorigenesis and metastasis in
      mice and is androgen regulated.
PG  - E3588-96
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1113960109 [doi]
AB  - Overexpression of CD24, a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-linked sialoglycoprotein,
      is associated with poor outcome in urothelial carcinoma and contributes to
      experimental tumor growth and metastasis. However, the requirement for CD24
      (Cd24a in mice) in tumorigenesis and spontaneous metastasis from the orthotopic
      site remains uncharacterized. Using N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine
      induction of invasive and metastatic bladder cancer, we show that Cd24a-deficient
      male mice developed fewer bladder tumors than C57BL/6 control male mice.
      Evaluating only mice with evidence of primary tumors, we observed that
      Cd24a-deficient male mice also had fewer metastases than wild-type counterparts. 
      In parallel observations, stratification of patients based on CD24
      immunohistochemical expression in their tumors revealed that high levels of CD24 
      are associated with poor prognosis in males. In female patients and mice the
      above observations were not present. Given the significant role of CD24 in males,
      we sought to assess the relationship between androgen and CD24 regulation. We
      discovered that androgen receptor knockdown in UM-UC-3 and TCCSUP human
      urothelial carcinoma cell lines resulted in suppression of CD24 expression and
      cell proliferation. Androgen treatment also led to increased CD24 promoter
      activity, dependent on the presence of androgen receptor. In vivo, androgen
      deprivation resulted in reduced growth and CD24 expression of UM-UC-3 xenografts,
      and the latter was rescued by exogenous CD24 overexpression. These findings
      demonstrate an important role for CD24 in urothelial tumorigenesis and metastasis
      in male mice and indicate that CD24 is androgen regulated, providing the
      foundation for urothelial bladder cancer therapy with antiandrogens.

TI  - Nicastrin regulates breast cancer stem cell properties and tumor growth in vitro 
      and in vivo.
PG  - 16558-63
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1206268109 [doi]
AB  - Nicastrin (NCT) is a crucial component of the gamma-secretase (GS) enzyme, which 
      prompted investigations into its biological role in cancer. We have previously
      shown that nicastrin is overexpressed in breast cancer (BC), conferring worse
      overall survival in invasive, ERalpha negative patients. Here, we used 2D and 3D 
      Matrigel, anchorage-independent growth conditions and a breast cancer xenograft
      mouse model to assess the impact of nicastrin on breast cancer stem cell (BCSC)
      propagation and invasion in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Stable knockdown of
      nicastrin in HCC1806 breast cancer cells reduced cell invasion by 51.4 +/- 1.7%, 
      accompanied by a morphological change to a rounded cell phenotype and
      down-regulation of vimentin, Snail, Twist, MMP2, and MMP9. We observed a
      reduction of the pool of CD44(+)/CD24(-) and ALDH1 high breast cancer stem cells 
      by threefold and twofold, respectively, and a reduction by 2.6-fold of the
      mammospheres formation. Nicastrin overexpression in nontransformed MCF10A cells
      caused an induction of epithelial to mesenchymal regulators, as well as a
      fivefold increased ALDH1 activity, a threefold enrichment for CD44(+)/CD24(-)
      stem cells, and a 3.2-fold enhanced mammosphere-forming capacity. Using the
      gamma-sescretase inhibiton, Notch1/4 siRNA, and Akt inhibition, we show that
      nicastrin regulates breast cancer stem cells partly through Notch1 and the Akt
      pathway. Exploiting serial dilution transplantation of the HCC1806 cells
      expressing nicastrin and HCC1806 stably depleted of nicastrin, in vivo, we
      demonstrate that nicastrin inhibition may be relevant for the reduced
      tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells. These data could serve as a benchmark for 
      development of nicastrin-targeted therapies in breast cancer.

TI  - MiR-494 is regulated by ERK1/2 and modulates TRAIL-induced apoptosis in
      non-small-cell lung cancer through BIM down-regulation.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have an important role in the development of chemosensitivity 
      or chemoresistance in different types of cancer. Activation of the ERK1/2 pathway
      is a major determinant of diverse cellular processes and cancer development and
      is responsible for the transcription of several important miRNAs. Here we show a 
      link between the ERK1/2 pathway and BIM expression through miR-494. We blocked
      ERK1/2 nuclear activity through the overexpression of an ERK1/2 natural
      interactor, the protein PED/PEA15, and we performed a microRNA expression
      profile. miR-494 was the most down-regulated microRNA after ERK1/2 inactivation. 
      Moreover, we found that miR-494 induced Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related
      apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) resistance in non-small-cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) through the down-modulation of BIM. Elucidation of this undiscovered
      ERK1/2 pathway that regulates apoptosis and cell proliferation through miR-494 in
      NSCLC will greatly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for
      TRAIL resistance and will provide an additional arm for the development of
      anticancer therapies.

      B promotes lymphatic metastasis of hypoxic breast cancer cells.
PG  - E2707-16
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1214019109 [doi]
AB  - Lymphatic dissemination from the primary tumor is a major mechanism by which
      breast cancer cells access the systemic circulation, resulting in distant
      metastasis and mortality. Numerous studies link activation of hypoxia-inducible
      factor 1 (HIF-1) with tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and patient mortality.
      However, the role of HIF-1 in lymphatic dissemination is poorly understood. In
      this study, we show that HIF-1 promotes lymphatic metastasis of breast cancer by 
      direct transactivation of the gene encoding platelet-derived growth factor B
      (PDGF-B), which has proliferative and chemotactic effects on lymphatic
      endothelial cells. Lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis in mice bearing
      human breast cancer orthografts were blocked by administration of the HIF-1
      inhibitor digoxin or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. Immunohistochemical 
      analysis of human breast cancer biopsies demonstrated colocalization of
      HIF-1alpha and PDGF-B, which were correlated with lymphatic vessel area and
      histological grade. Taken together, these data provide experimental support for
      breast cancer clinical trials targeting HIF-1 and PDGF-B.

AB  - Deregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression can lead to cancer initiation and
      progression. However, limited information exists on the function of miRNAs in
      cancer maintenance. We examined these issues in the case of myeloproliferative
      diseases and neoplasms (MPN), a collection of hematopoietic neoplasms regarded as
      preleukemic, thereby representing early neoplastic states. We report here that
      microRNA-125a (miR-125a)-induced MPN display a complex manner of oncogene
      dependence. Following a gain-of-function genomics screen, we overexpressed
      candidate miR-125a in vivo, which led to phenotypes consistent with an atypical
      MPN characterized by leukocytosis, monocytosis, splenomegaly, and progressive
      anemia. The diseased MPN state could be recapitulated in a doxycycline-inducible 
      mouse model. Upon doxycycline withdrawal, the primary MPN phenotypes rapidly
      resolved after the discontinuation of miR-125a overexpression. However,
      reinduction of miR-125a led to complex phenotypes, with some animals rapidly
      developing lethal anemia with extensive damages in the spleen. Forced expression 
      of miR-125a resulted in elevated cellular tyrosine phosphorylation and
      hypersensitivity toward hematopoietic cytokines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
      miR-125a targets multiple protein phosphatases. Our data demonstrate that
      miR-125a-induced MPN is addicted to its sustained overexpression, and highlight
      the complex nature of oncogenic miRNA dependence in an early neoplastic state.

TI  - Anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody conjugated to ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron
      oxide nanoparticles in an application of MR molecular imaging of pancreatic
      cancer cell lines.
PG  - 1049-58
LID - 10.1258/ar.2012.120055 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemokine receptor 4(CXCR4) plays an important role in the potential 
      growth of pancreatic tumor and its ability to develop metastasis. Ultrasmall
      superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles offer strong
      contrast-enhancing effect for MR imaging of pancreatic tissue. PURPOSE: To
      establish a biomarker-targeted nanoparticulate contrast agent CXCR4-USPIO for
      pancreatic cancer cell MR imaging and to investigate the relationship between in 
      vitro MR T2 enhancement ratio, DeltaR2 values, and the cellular CXCR4 expression 
      levels. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The CXCR4 monoclonal antibody and bovine serum
      albumin (BSA) were bioconjugated with USPIO using carbodiimide. The T2 and T2*
      values of CXCR4-USPIO, BSA-USPIO, and USPIO were evaluated at the same iron
      concentration levels. After incubating four pancreatic cancer cell lines (AsPC-1,
      BxPC-3, CFPAC-1, PANC-1) with CXCR4-USPIO and BSA-USPIO, respectively, changes of
      T2 values were measured with a clinical 1.5-T MRI scanner. Western blot and
      immunofluorescence tests were applied to semi-quantitatively analyze the
      expression levels of CXCR4 in the four cell lines. RESULTS: MR imaging revealed a
      linear correlation between DeltaR2 and DeltaR2* values of CXCR4-USPIO
      nanoparticles and the iron concentrations. The T2 enhancement ratio and DeltaR2
      values of AsPC-1, BxPC-3, CFPAC-1, PANC-1 cell lines in the CXCR4-USPIO group
      exhibited strong correlation with the CXCR4 peptide relative grey values measured
      by western blot (r = 0.976, P = 0.024; r = 0.959, P = 0.041, respectively) and
      the mean fluorescence signal intensity detected by laser scanning confocal
      microscopy (r = 0.996, P = 0.004; r = 0.962, P = 0.038, respectively).
      CONCLUSION: The targeted probe CXCR4-USPIO was created for MR molecular imaging
      of pancreatic cancer cell lines. The T2 enhancement ratio and DeltaR2 values of
      CXCR4-USPIO nanoparticles could semi-quantitatively assess the cellular CXCR4
      expression levels.

TI  - A logistic regression model for predicting axillary lymph node metastases in
      early breast carcinoma patients.
PG  - 9936-50
AB  - Nodal staging in breast cancer is a key predictor of prognosis. This paper
      presents the results of potential clinicopathological predictors of axillary
      lymph node involvement and develops an efficient prediction model to assist in
      predicting axillary lymph node metastases. Seventy patients with primary early
      breast cancer who underwent axillary dissection were evaluated. Univariate and
      multivariate logistic regression were performed to evaluate the association
      between clinicopathological factors and lymph node metastatic status. A logistic 
      regression predictive model was built from 50 randomly selected patients; the
      model was also applied to the remaining 20 patients to assess its validity.
      Univariate analysis showed a significant relationship between lymph node
      involvement and absence of nm-23 (p = 0.010) and Kiss-1 (p = 0.001) expression.
      Absence of Kiss-1 remained significantly associated with positive axillary node
      status in the multivariate analysis (p = 0.018). Seven clinicopathological
      factors were involved in the multivariate logistic regression model: menopausal
      status, tumor size, ER, PR, HER2, nm-23 and Kiss-1. The model was accurate and
      discriminating, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of
      0.702 when applied to the validation group. Moreover, there is a need discover
      more specific candidate proteins and molecular biology tools to select more
      variables which should improve predictive accuracy.

TI  - Systematic deciphering of cancer genome networks.

AB  - When growth regulatory genes are damaged in a cell, it may become cancerous.
      Current technological advances in the last decade have allowed the
      characterization of the whole genome of these cells by directly or indirectly
      measuring DNA changes. Complementary analyses were developed to make sense of the
      massive amounts of data generated. A large majority of these analyses were
      developed to construct interaction networks between genes from, primarily,
      expression array data. We review the current technologies and analyses that have 
      developed in the last decade. We further argue that as cancer genomics evolves
      from single gene validations to gene network inferences, new analyses must be
      developed for the different technological platforms.

TI  - Prostate cancer screening trends in a large, integrated health care system.
PG  - 4-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: As the debate over the effectiveness of prostate-specific antigen
      (PSA) screening for prostate cancer continues, it is increasingly important to
      understand how PSA screening occurs in general-practice settings. METHODS: We
      conducted a retrospective cohort study within Kaiser Permanente Southern
      California, a large integrated health care system. Men aged 35 years and older at
      baseline, in 1998, were eligible. The proportion of men who underwent PSA
      screening was estimated and compared across groups defined by patient and
      physician characteristics. We also evaluated trends in screening across time and 
      serum PSA levels for all subgroups. RESULTS: Of 2,061,047 men, 572,306 (28%)
      underwent PSA screening from 1998 through 2007. Patterns of PSA screening varied 
      modestly by age, race, and physician. The lowest frequencies of screening
      occurred among men younger than age 45 years (19%) and men ages 85 years and
      older (13%). PSA screening was most common among white men (33.5%) and in men
      seen by physicians of the same race/ethnicity (32%), compared with men with
      physicians of disparate race/ethnicity (26%, p < 0.001). PSA screening increased 
      over time for all racial/ethnic groups and among men age 75 years and older but
      decreased over time for men younger than age 75 years old. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 1 
      in 4 eligible men underwent PSA screening from 1998 through 2007, and screening
      varied only modestly by patient and physician characteristics. Estimates of the
      frequency of PSA screening in general-practice settings can inform the debate and
      provide useful insight as to how changes in cancer screening guidelines would
      alter practice patterns in an increasingly integrated health care environment.

TI  - Where EGF receptors transmit their signals.
PG  - pe41
AB  - Excessive signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) can cause cancer. What
      molecular mechanisms normally control RTK signaling? Are they defective in
      tumors? If so, should therapeutics be developed to restore particular regulatory 
      pathways to cancer cells? These questions have been approached through
      mechanistic studies of a prototypical RTK, the epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR). EGFR signaling is mediated and regulated by both signaling and
      trafficking effectors. The amplitude of receptor-proximal signals changes as
      EGFRs move along the degradative trafficking pathway from the cell surface, to
      endosomes, and into lysosomes. To optimize therapeutic suppression of receptor
      oncogenicity, it may be crucial to target EGFRs that are signaling from a
      specific site in the trafficking pathway. Research suggests that EGFRs at the
      plasma membrane produce the bulk of the global transcriptional response to EGF.
      EGFRs localized between the internalization and early endosome fusion stages of
      the pathway enrich the expression of transcripts associated with cancer. EGFRs at
      later trafficking checkpoints controlled by the endosomal sorting complex
      required for transport (ESCRT) complexes II and III do not contribute
      substantially to the EGFR-mediated transcriptional response. These results
      suggest that therapeutics targeting the receptors at the earliest stages of
      degradative trafficking might be most effective.

TI  - The effect of high quality assurance measures in bowel cancer screening on
      patient satisfaction of colonoscopy.
PG  - 251-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: To ensure patient safety, rigorous quality assurance (QA) measures
      for colonoscopy were introduced for the Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP)
      in England. The impact of these high QA measures on patient experience and
      satisfaction is unknown. AIMS: To determine the impact of this high-level QA of
      colonoscopy on patient satisfaction. METHODS: A case controlled study using a
      retrospective audit & telephone interview patient survey was performed between
      1/1/07-01/10/08 on patients that underwent colonoscopy. Data were analyzed by
      comparing quantitative and qualitative performance colonoscopy indicators in
      patients within the BCSP with those outside the programme (NON-BCSP).
      PARTICIPANTS: 720 patients that had undergone day case colonoscopy. SETTING:
      Accredited BCSP centre: University Hospitals Aintree, UK. INTERVENTION: Comparing
      patient satisfaction between BCSP to NON-BCSP populations. RESULTS: Uptake was
      68% (n=488). Caecal intubation rate (CIR) was higher (99 v 91%; p=0.001), and
      sedation doses lower in BCSP compared to NON-BCSP (Midazolam dose Median [IQR] (1
      [0, 2] v 2 [1, 3] mg; respectively p=0.0001). For patient satisfaction and
      experience, scores were high and pain scores were low in both groups; with no
      statistically significant difference between groups. However, willingness to have
      a repeat procedure was higher in BCSP (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Whilst superior CIR
      with less sedation within BCSP, overall scores were similar for patient
      satisfaction, both in and outside the programme. With the higher 'willingness for
      repeat' within BCSP, a positive impact of higher level of QA is suggested and
      that good patient experience can be achieved with minimal conscious sedation in
      expert hands.

TI  - Fluoropyrimidines plus cisplatin versus gemcitabine/gemcitabine plus cisplatin in
      locally advanced and metastatic biliary tract carcinoma - a retrospective study.
PG  - 277-84
AB  - AIM: This is a retrospective study of patients with advanced biliary tract
      carcinoma (BTC), who were treated with different regimens of chemotherapy.
      METHODS: We studied patients with advanced BTC registered at the Department of
      Oncology at the Fundeni Clinical Institute between 2004 and 2008. The following
      data were analyzed: rate of response, progression free survival (PFS) to first
      and second line of chemotherapy, overall survival (OS) and drug toxicity.
      Ninety-six patients were eligible having either advanced intra or extrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma, or gallbladder cancer with no prior chemotherapy. RESULTS:
      Out of 96 patients, 57 (59.4%) received fluoropyrimidines (FP)+cisplatin and 39
      (40.6%) gemcitabine (Gem)+/-cisplatin. The median PFS for FP+cisplatin was 5.9
      months (95%CI 5-6.9) and for Gem+/-cisplatin 6.3 months (95%CI 5.4-7.1), p=0.661.
      Median OS for FP+cisplatin was 10.3 months (95%CI 7.5-13.1) and for
      Gem+/-cisplatin 9.1 months (95%CI 7.0-11.2), p=0.098. On disease progression, 46 
      patients received second line CT (Gem or FP+/-platinum compounds). Median OS for 
      patients with FP based first line and Gem+/-cisplatin in second line was 19
      months (95%CI 8.9-29) higher than for the reverse sequence: 13.2 months (95%CI
      12-14.4), but not statistically significant (p=0.830). All patients were
      evaluated for toxicities. Most patients (75.5%) reported at least one adverse
      event. CONCLUSION: Our results through direct comparison of FP+cisplatin with
      Gem+/-cisplatin as first line treatment did not show any statistical differences 
      in terms of rate of response, PFS and OS. However, our study showed that
      FP+cisplatin as first line and Gem based second line therapy gave a better OS
      rate.

PG  - 1530-5
AB  - Besides the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in the
      regulation of the cardiovascular system, there is accumulating molecular and in
      vivo evidence to demonstrate that the RAS is implicated in the development or
      invasion of several kinds of cancer tissue. Recent studies indicate that AT1
      receptor blockers have the anti-tumor effect in various cancers by inhibiting
      angiogenesis. Furthermore, some angiotensin peptides including angiotensin 1-7
      have been clarified to influence malignancy, and the insertion/deletion
      polymorphism in the angiotensin converting enzyme gene is likely to be associated
      with the risk of cancer. This article provides an overview of important aspects
      on the cutting edge of RAS in some kinds of cancer.

      cancer].
PG  - 1604-12
AB  - Angiotensin II and AT1 receptor could be involved in the growth of androgen
      independent prostate cancer since we found the higher expression of AT1 receptor 
      in prostate cancer tissue than in normal tissue. Angiotensin II directly and
      indirectly stimulates the growth of prostate cancer cells and stromal cells
      including angiogenic cells. ARBs experimentally inhibited the proliferation of
      cancer cells and angiogenesis. The administration of ARBs for castration
      resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) induced the decline of serum prostate specific
      antigen (PSA) and the improvement of performance status in cachexic CRPC
      patients. These results support the hypothesis that an intrinsic RAS exists in
      the prostate gland and it is likely that ARBs are useful molecular targeting
      agents for CRPC.

TI  - Trade-off between survival and laryngeal preservation in advanced laryngeal
      cancer: the otorhinolaryngology patient's perspective.
PG  - 570-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We performed a prospective study to evaluate, from the patient's
      perspective, the trade-off between speech and survival that individuals face when
      given a diagnosis of advanced-stage laryngeal cancer amenable to either total
      laryngectomy or a laryngeal preservation protocol using chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy. METHODS: Volunteers (309) consecutively seen at the
      otorhinolaryngology clinic of a university teaching hospital in France completed 
      an anonymous questionnaire designed to determine their position if they faced the
      diagnosis of an advanced-stage laryngeal cancer. Univariate analysis was
      performed for potential statistical relationships with various variables.
      RESULTS: We found that 12.9% of patients were unable to determine their position 
      regarding the two treatment options offered, and this group had a significant
      statistical relationship with four variables (age, education, professional
      status, and history of cancer among relatives). We found that 24.6% of patients
      made survival their main consideration and would not consider any trade-off.
      Among the 62.5% who considered the trade-off, the percentage of cure that
      patients were ready to lose in order to preserve their larynx varied from 5% to
      100% (mean, 33%; SD, 23%). Aside from the undecided group, none of the variables 
      analyzed was related either to the decision as to whether to consider a trade-off
      or to the percentage of c re that patients agreed to trade to preserve their
      larynx. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced-stage laryngeal cancer, treatment 
      should be initiated only after careful evaluation of the patient's attitude
      toward both laryngeal preservation and survival.

TI  - Patent Blue V dye anaphylaxis: experience of Australian and New Zealand surgeons.
PG  - 37-41

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patent Blue V dye (PBVD) can cause severe anaphylaxis. For sentinel
      node biopsy (SNB) in breast cancer patients, controversy exists as to the utility
      of PBVD in addition to lymphoscintigraphy. This survey assessed Australian and
      New Zealand breast surgeons' experience of anaphylaxis with PBVD. METHODS: The
      survey was distributed to all 180 members of the BreastSurgANZ society in May
      2011. Seventy-six (42%) current members responded. A retrospective analysis was
      performed on survey responses. RESULTS: Seventy-five members used PBVD on a
      median of 50 cases per year (0-250 cases per year) for a median of 10 years (4
      months-15 years). Overall, 44 members (58.7%) experienced definite or possible
      allergic reaction to PBVD, but only 16 members (21%) witnessed severe anaphylaxis
      associated with a fall in blood pressure. Of the 34 members who experienced what 
      they considered definite anaphylactic reactions with PBVD, only 18 members
      confirmed with allergy testing. The overall reported incidence of anaphylactic
      reactions of any severity was 0.15%. The median time to anaphylaxis was 20 min
      (0-90 min). Forty members (53.3%) reported routine discussion about PBVD risks as
      part of informed consent. Only seven members performed routine pre-op skin
      testing. Overall, 91% of the members accepted the rare but real risk of severe
      anaphylaxis and 76% did not question the additional value associated with its
      use. CONCLUSION: Australian and New Zealand breast surgeons' reported that the
      anaphylaxis rate from PBVD was 0.15%. The majority of surgeons continued to use
      PBVD to facilitate SNB.

TI  - MiR-150 is associated with poor prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
      via targeting the EMT inducer ZEB1.
PG  - 48-54
LID - 10.1111/cas.12030 [doi]
AB  - The association of microRNAs (miRs) with cancer progression has been established 
      in many cancers including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). A public
      microarray database showed that the expression of miR-150 was lower in ESCC than 
      in normal esophageal mucosa. Here, we focused on ZEB1,
      epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT)-inducer, as a target gene of miR-150
      based on in silico predictions. The purpose of this study was to clarify the
      clinicopathological significance of miR-150 in ESCC, and to investigate miR-150's
      EMT-regulatory ability. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to evaluate miR-150
      expression in 108 curative resected ESCC samples to determine the
      clinicopathological significance. Moreover, we examined the in vitro and in vivo 
      function of miR-150 via degradation of ZEB1. MiR-150 expression was significantly
      lower in cancer tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P < 0.001).
      Low expression of miR-150 in ESCC contributed to malignant potential, such as
      tumor depth, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, clinical
      staging, and poor prognosis (P < 0.05). In vitro assays showed that
      EMT-inducer-ZEB1 is a new direct target of miR-150. Moreover, miR-150 induced
      MET-like changes in TE-8 cells through ZEB1 degradation (e.g., E-cadherin
      expression, vimentin repression, epithelial morphology, and suppression of
      migration ability), and significantly inhibited tumorigenicity and tumor growth
      in a mouse xenograft model. Analysis of the regulation of ZEB1 by miR-150 could
      provide new insights into preventing metastasis and also suggests novel targeted 
      therapeutic strategies in ESCC.

AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the colon-targeted Irinotecan
      Hydrochloride (ITC-HCl) loaded microspheres by pharmacokinetic and biochemical
      studies. The microspheres were prepared by double emulsion solvent evaporation
      method with natural polymer Assam Bora rice starch. The microspheres were
      characterized for their micromeritics properties, incorporation efficiency, in
      vitro and in vivo drug release studies. The release study confirmed the
      insignificant release of ITC-HCl in physiological condition of stomach and small 
      intestine and major drug release in the caecal content. In vivo release study of 
      the optimized microsphere was compared with immediate release (IR) ITC-HCl.
      ITC-HCl was distributed predominantly in the upper GI tract from the IR, whereas 
      ITC-HCl was distributed primarily to the lower part of GI tract from the
      microspheres formulation. Enhanced levels of liver enzymes were found in animals 
      given IR ITC-HCl as well as augmented levels of serum albumin, creatinine,
      leucocytopenia and thrombocytopenia was also observed. In summary, Assam Bora
      rice starch microspheres exhibit slow and extended release of ITC-HCl over longer
      periods of time with reduced systemic side-effects.

      performance and drug release rate of functionalized amphiphilic diblock copolymer
      micelles.
PG  - 3877-86
LID - 10.1021/bm301425j [doi]
AB  - Polymeric drug nanocarriers integrated with diagnostic and sensing functions are 
      capable of in situ monitoring the biodistribution of chemotherapeutic drugs and
      imaging/contrasting agents, which enables the establishment of image-guided
      personalized cancer therapeutic protocols. Responsive multifunctional theranostic
      nanocarriers possessing external stimuli-tunable drug release rates and imaging
      signal intensities represent another promising direction in this field. In this
      work, we fabricated responsive amphiphilic diblock copolymer micelles exhibiting 
      light-triggered hydrophobic-hydrophilic transition within micellar cores and the 
      concomitant enhancement of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrast performance
      and release rate of physically encapsulated hydrophobic drugs.
      POEGMA-b-P(NIPAM-co-NBA-co-Gd) diblock copolymer covalently labeled with Gd(3+)
      complex (Gd) in the light-responsive block was synthesized at first, where OEGMA,
      NIPAM, and NBA are oligo(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether methacrylate,
      N-isopropylacrylamide, and o-nitrobenzyl acrylate, respectively. The amphiphilic 
      diblock copolymer spontaneously self-assembles in aqueous solution into micellar 
      nanoparticles possessing hydrophobic P(NIPAM-co-NBA-co-Gd) cores and hydrophilic 
      POEGMA coronas, which can physically encapsulate doxorubicin (Dox) as a model
      chemotherapeutic drug. Upon UV irradiation, hydrophobic NBA moieties within
      micellar cores transform into hydrophilic carboxyl derivatives, triggering
      micelle microstructural changes and core swelling. During this process, the
      microenvironment surrounding Gd(3+) complexes was subjected to a transition from 
      being hydrophobic to hydrophilic, leading to the enhancement of MR imaging
      contrast performance, that is, ~1.9-fold increase in longitudinal relaxivity
      (r(1)). In addition, the release rate of encapsulated Dox was also enhanced (~65%
      of Dox release in 12 h upon UV irradiation versus ~47% Dox release in 25 h for
      the control). The reported strategy of light-triggered coenhancement of MR
      imaging contrast performance and drug release profiles represents a general route
      to the construction of next generation smart polymeric theranostic nanocarriers.

      in breast cancer cells.
PG  - 36-42
LID - 10.1111/cas.12032 [doi]
AB  - Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) is an endoplasmic reticulum anchored enzyme
      catalyzing the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, mainly palmytoleyl-CoA
      and oleyl-CoA. Recent studies have revealed a function for SCD1 in the modulation
      of signaling processes related to cell proliferation, survival and transformation
      to cancer. We used MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells to analyze the role of SCD1 in the
      metastatic acquisition of breast cancer cells. Silencing SCD1 expression in
      breast cancer cells has no effect on cell viability but the levels of cell
      proliferation, cell cycle genes' expressions and the phosphorylation state of
      ERK1/2 MAPK are significantly reduced. Decreasing SCD1 expression also reduces
      the level of GSK3 phosphorylation, indicating higher activity of the kinase.
      Using cells fractionation, immunofluorescence and a beta-catenin/TCF-responsive
      reporter construct, we demonstrate that lowering SCD1 expression leads to a
      decrease of beta-catenin amounts within the nucleus and to inhibition of its
      transactivation capacity. Moreover, MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with the SCD1
      siRNA show a lower invasive potential than the control cells. Taken together, our
      data demonstrate that low SCD1 expression is associated with a decrease in the
      proliferation rate of breast cancer cells associated with a decrease in ERK1/2
      activation. SCD1 silencing also inhibits GSK3 phosphorylation, lowering
      beta-catenin translocation to the nucleus, and, subsequently, its transactivation
      capacity and the expression of its target genes. Finally, we show that silencing 
      SCD1 impairs the epithelial to mesenchymal transition-like behavior of the cells,
      a characteristic of metastatic breast cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The clinical value of preoperative tumour markers
      remains elusive in gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      prognostic value of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA),
      carbohydrate antigen (CA)19-9, CA50 and CA72-4 in gastric cancer. METHODS: About 
      391 gastric cancer patients who underwent curative D2 gastrectomy between 2001
      and 2006 were evaluated. The correlation between tumour markers and
      clinicopathologic characteristics and prognostic value of preoperative tumour
      markers was investigated. RESULTS: Correlation analysis showed that AFP was
      associated with tumour size (P = 0.040); CEA with lymphatic invasion (P = 0.023) 
      and pathological stage (P = 0.018); CA19-9 with tumour size (P = 0.000), Borrmann
      type (P = 0.027), lymphatic invasion (P = 0.020) and pathological stage (P =
      0.001); CA50 with lymphatic invasion (P = 0.004) and pathological stage (P =
      0.004); CA72-4 with tumour size (P = 0.000), tumour size (P = 0.000) and Borrmann
      type (P = 0.008); lymphatic invasion (P = 0.000), nervous invasion (P = 0.028)
      and pathological stage (P = 0.000). Multivariate analysis showed that CEA, tumour
      site, Borrmann type and pathological stage were independent prognostic factors.
      CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative CEA might be a candidate for the staging system in
      addition to conventional factors.

AB  - We present a novel semiparametric survival model with a log-linear median
      regression function. As a useful alternative to existing semiparametric models,
      our large model class has many important practical advantages, including
      interpretation of the regression parameters via the median and the ability to
      address heteroscedasticity. We demonstrate that our modeling technique
      facilitates the ease of prior elicitation and computation for both parametric and
      semiparametric Bayesian analysis of survival data. We illustrate the advantages
      of our modeling, as well as model diagnostics, via a reanalysis of a small-cell
      lung cancer study. Results of our simulation study provide further support for
      our model in practice.

TI  - Development of a disease-specific health-related quality of life questionnaire
      (THYCA-QoL) for thyroid cancer survivors.
PG  - 447-54
LID - 10.3109/0284186X.2012.718445 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, no valid instrument is available that focuses on specific
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) issues that affect thyroid cancer
      survivors. The objective of this study was to develop and pretest a thyroid
      cancer specific HRQoL questionnaire that can be used in addition to the more
      general European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of
      Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Potentially relevant
      issues were identified by a systematic literature review, a focus group meeting, 
      and an issue list completed by six health care professionals (HCP) and 18 thyroid
      cancer survivors. Resultant issues were analyzed on importance and relevance
      (phase I). The issues were formulated into a long provisional list of questions
      (phase II). These questions were administered in combination with the EORTC
      QLQ-C30 to 306 Dutch thyroid cancer survivors to pretest the hypothesized scale
      structure (phase III). Although the development of this questionnaire was not set
      up as an international study, phases I-III are in agreement with the methodology 
      of the EORTC guidelines. RESULTS: The literature search, focus group and issue
      list completed by HCP and survivors resulted in 75 issues. These were reduced to 
      create a 30 item provisional list. Pretesting led to a selection of 24 items with
      a good range of response. This resulted in the THYCA-QoL containing 24 items and 
      seven conceptual scales. CONCLUSION: The THYCA-QoL in combination with the EORTC 
      QLQ-C30 is ready for a large (international) scale validation study, and will
      assess HRQoL issues of most relevance and concern for thyroid cancer survivors.

TI  - Mapping cancer risk in southwestern Ontario with changing census boundaries.
PG  - 1228-37
LID - 10.1111/j.1541-0420.2012.01792.x [doi]
AB  - Mapping disease risk often involves working with data that have been spatially
      aggregated to census regions or postal regions, either for administrative reasons
      or confidentiality. When studying rare diseases, data must be collected over a
      long time period in order to accumulate a meaningful number of cases. These long 
      time periods can result in spatial boundaries of the census regions changing over
      time, as is the case with the motivating example of exploring the spatial
      structure of mesothelioma lung cancer risk in Lambton County and Middlesex County
      of southwestern Ontario, Canada. This article presents a local-EM kernel
      smoothing algorithm that allows for the combining of data from different spatial 
      maps, being capable of modeling risk for spatially aggregated data with
      time-varying boundaries. Inference and uncertainty estimates are carried out with
      parametric bootstrap procedures, and cross-validation is used for bandwidth
      selection. Results for the lung cancer study are shown and discussed.

TI  - Improved analytical methods for the detection and quantification of neutralizing 
      antibodies to biopharmaceuticals.
PG  - 2179-90
AB  - Biopharmaceuticals are used extensively for the treatment of a number of chronic 
      debilitating and fatal diseases such as cancer and inflammatory or autoimmune
      diseases. Although biopharmaceuticals are in general well tolerated, the
      development of anti-drug antibodies can impair their safety and efficacy.
      Assessment of immunogenicity is essential for a more effective and rational use
      of biopharmaceuticals, and is dependent upon the establishment of efficient
      standardized assays that allow direct comparison of immunogenicity data with
      clinical outcome. Although regulatory authorities recommend the use of cell-based
      assays that reflect the mechanism of action of the drug for the detection of
      neutralizing anti-drug antibodies, conventional cell-based assays are difficult
      to standardize and often give variable results. A number of strategies have been 
      adopted to improve the performance of cell-based assays, including quantification
      of drug-induced proteins using either real-time RT-PCR or branched DNA to detect 
      mRNA, or ELISAs to detect protein, bridging assays using immobilized cells and
      the use of reporter gene assays. The relative merits and limitations of each of
      these methods is reviewed herein.

TI  - A pilot randomized controlled trial of the feasibility of a self-directed coping 
      skills intervention for couples facing prostate cancer: rationale and design.
PG  - 119
LID - 10.1186/1477-7525-10-119 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although it is known both patients' and partners' reactions to a
      prostate cancer diagnosis include fear, uncertainty, anxiety and depression with 
      patients' partners' reactions mutually determining how they cope with and adjust 
      to the illness, few psychosocial interventions target couples. Those that are
      available tend to be led by highly trained professionals, limiting their
      accessibility and long-term sustainability. In addition, it is recognised that
      patients who might benefit from conventional face-to-face psychosocial
      interventions do not access these, either by preference or because of
      geographical or mobility barriers. Self-directed interventions can overcome some 
      of these limitations and have been shown to contribute to patient well-being.
      This study will examine the feasibility of a self-directed, coping skills
      intervention for couples affected by cancer, called Coping-Together, and begin to
      explore its potential impact on couples' illness adjustment. The pilot version of
      Coping-Together includes a series of four booklets, a DVD, and a relaxation audio
      CD. METHODS/DESIGN: In this double-blind, two-group, parallel, randomized
      controlled trial, 70 couples will be recruited within 4 months of a prostate
      cancer diagnosis through urology private practices and randomized to: 1)
      Coping-Together or 2) a minimal ethical care condition. Minimal ethical care
      condition couples will be mailed information booklets available at the Cancer
      Council New South Wales and a brochure for the Cancer Council Helpline. The
      primary outcome (anxiety) and additional secondary outcomes (distress,
      depression, dyadic adjustment, quality of life, illness or caregiving appraisal, 
      self-efficacy, and dyadic and individual coping) will be assessed at baseline
      (before receiving study material) and 2 months post-baseline. Intention-to-treat 
      and per protocol analysis will be conducted. DISCUSSION: As partners' distress
      rates exceed not only population norms, but also those reported by patients
      themselves, it is imperative that coping skills interventions target the couple
      as a unit and enhance both partners' ability to overcome cancer challenges. This 
      pilot study will examine the feasibility and potential efficacy of
      Coping-Together in optimising couples' illness adjustment. This is one of the
      first feasibility studies to test this innovative coping intervention, which in
      turn will contribute to the larger literature advocating for psychosocial care of
      couples affected by prostate cancer. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand

TI  - Regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor by melatonin in human breast
      cancer cells.
PG  - 373-80
LID - 10.1111/jpi.12007 [doi]
AB  - Melatonin exerts oncostatic effects on breast cancer by interfering with the
      estrogen-signaling pathways. Melatonin reduces estrogen biosynthesis in human
      breast cancer cells, surrounding fibroblasts and peritumoral endothelial cells by
      regulating cytokines that influence tumor microenvironment. This hormone also
      exerts antiangiogenic activity in tumoral tissue. In this work, our objective was
      to study the role of melatonin on the regulation of the vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) in breast cancer cells. To accomplish this, we cocultured
      human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) with human umbilical vein endothelial cells
      (HUVECs). VEGF added to the cultures stimulated the proliferation of HUVECs and
      melatonin (1 mM) counteracted this effect. Melatonin reduced VEGF production and 
      VEGF mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells cocultured with HUVECs
      stimulated the endothelial cells proliferation and increased VEGF levels in the
      culture media. Melatonin counteracted both stimulatory effects on HUVECs
      proliferation and on VEGF protein levels in the coculture media. Conditioned
      media from MCF-7 cells increased HUVECs proliferation, and this effect was
      significantly counteracted by anti-VEGF and 1 mM melatonin. All these findings
      suggest that melatonin may play a role in the paracrine interactions between
      malignant epithelial cells and proximal endothelial cells through a
      downregulatory action on VEGF expression in human breast cancer cells, which
      decrease the levels of VEGF around endothelial cells. Lower levels of VEGF could 
      be important in reducing the number of estrogen-producing cells proximal to
      malignant cells as well as decreasing tumoral angiogenesis.

TI  - Economic implications of rasburicase treatment in adult patients with tumour
      lysis syndrome.
PG  - 431-40
LID - 10.2165/11634230-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rasburicase is a recombinant urate-oxidase enzyme used to reduce high
      levels of plasma uric acid (PUA) resulting from tumour lysis syndrome (TLS).
      Rasburicase reduces PUA levels within 4 hours of administration, thereby
      minimizing the risk of serious complications from TLS. Treatment pattern analyses
      indicate rasburicase is often used in combination with allopurinol; however, no
      studies have evaluated the clinical and economic consequences of this pattern of 
      care. The purpose of this study was to compare hospitalization costs, overall
      length of stay (LOS), and critical-care LOS in patients receiving rasburicase
      with or without allopurinol. METHODS: Hospital claims data from the Premier
      Perspective Database were used to conduct this retrospective analysis. Patients
      in the Premier hospital database who were administered rasburicase or combination
      therapy (rasburicase + allopurinol) within 2 days of hospital admission were
      eligible for study inclusion. Patients were excluded if they were <18 years of
      age or received haemodialysis (or any other renal replacement therapy support) on
      admission. Rasburicase patients were propensity-score-matched to combination
      therapy patients based on gender, race, hospital type (urban/rural, teaching),
      provider type, payer type, admission source, use of electrolyte modification
      therapy, critical-care admission and presence of a cancer diagnosis. Differences 
      in healthcare costs, overall LOS and critical-care LOS were assessed using
      gamma-distributed generalized linear models with a log-link function. RESULTS:
      The study population comprised 66 patients receiving rasburicase monotherapy
      matched to 66 patients receiving combination therapy. Mean age was 62.9 years,
      and 29% were female. Patients initiated on combination therapy had a shorter mean
      duration of rasburicase administration than patients initiated on monotherapy
      (2.1 vs 2.7 days) [p = 0.0059]. Additionally, rasburicase monotherapy incurred an
      average total cost of $US35 843 per hospitalization, compared with $US46 672 for 
      those receiving combination therapy (p = 0.0820). Rasburicase monotherapy
      patients also had a shorter mean overall LOS (10.0 days vs 15.4 days; p =
      0.0067). The mean critical-care LOS was similar in both cohorts (2.4 days
      rasburicase vs 2.9 days combination therapy; p = 0.3389). CONCLUSION: Examination
      of claims data showed that combination therapy (rasburicase + allopurinol)
      trended toward higher total hospitalization costs than rasburicase monotherapy.
      In addition, combination therapy was associated with significantly longer overall
      LOS compared with upfront rasburicase monotherapy in patients at risk for
      developing TLS.

TI  - Downregulation of miR-101 in gastric cancer correlates with cyclooxygenase-2
      overexpression and tumor growth.
PG  - 4201-12
LID - 10.1111/febs.12013 [doi]
AB  - Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays an important role in the carcinogenesis and
      progression of gastric cancer. It has been demonstrated that COX-2 overexpression
      depends on different cellular pathways, involving both transcriptional and
      post-transcriptional regulation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs
      that function as post-transcriptional regulators. Here, we characterize miR-101
      expression and its role in the regulation of COX-2 expression, which in turn,
      will provide us with additional insights into the potential therapeutic benefits 
      of exogenous miR-101 for treatment of gastric cancer. Our results showed that
      miR-101 levels in gastric cancer tissues were significantly lower than those in
      the matched normal tissue (P < 0.01). Furthermore, lower levels of miR-101 were
      associated with increased tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). We
      also found an inverse correlation between miR-101 and COX-2 expression in both
      gastric cancer specimens and cell lines. Significant decreases in COX-2 mRNA and 
      COX-2 levels were observed in the pre-miR-101-infected gastric cancer cells. One 
      possible mechanism of interaction is that miR-101 inhibited COX-2 expression by
      directly binding to the 3'-UTR of COX-2 mRNA. Overexpression of miR-101 in
      gastric cancer cell lines also inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis
      in vitro, as well as inhibiting tumor growth in vivo. These results collectively 
      indicate that miR-101 may function as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, with 
      COX-2 as a direct target.

TI  - Three-dimensional-engineered matrix to study cancer stem cells and tumorsphere
      formation: effect of matrix modulus.
PG  - 669-84
LID - 10.1089/ten.TEA.2012.0333 [doi]
AB  - Maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is regulated by the tumor
      microenvironment. Synthetic hydrogels provide the flexibility to design
      three-dimensional (3D) matrices to isolate and study individual factors in the
      tumor microenvironment. The objective of this work was to investigate the effect 
      of matrix modulus on tumorsphere formation by breast cancer cells and maintenance
      of CSCs in an inert microenvironment without the interference of other factors.
      In that regard, 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells were encapsulated in inert
      polyethylene glycol diacrylate hydrogels and the effect of matrix modulus on
      tumorsphere formation and expression of CSC markers was investigated. The gel
      modulus had a strong effect on tumorsphere formation and the effect was bimodal. 
      Tumorsphere formation and expression of CSC markers peaked after 8 days of
      culture. At day 8, as the matrix modulus was increased from 2.5 kPa to 5.3, 26.1,
      and 47.1 kPa, the average tumorsphere size changed from 37+/-6 mum to 57+/-6,
      20+/-4, and 12+/-2 mum, respectively; cell number density in the gel changed from
      0.8+/-0.1x10(5) cells/mL to 1.7+/-0.2x10(5), 0.4+/-0.1x10(5), and 0.2+/-0.1x10(5)
      cells/mL after initial encapsulation of 0.14x10(5) cells/mL; and the expression
      of CD44 breast CSC marker changed from 17+/-4-fold to 38+/-9-, 3+/-1-, and
      2+/-1-fold increase compared with the initial level. Similar results were
      obtained with MCF7 human breast carcinoma cells. Mouse 4T1 and human MCF7 cells
      encapsulated in the gel with 5.3 kPa modulus formed the largest tumorspheres and 
      highest density of tumorspheres, and had highest expression of breast CSC markers
      CD44 and ABCG2. The inert polyethylene glycol hydrogel can be used as a
      model-engineered 3D matrix to study the role of individual factors in the tumor
      microenvironment on tumorigenesis and maintenance of CSCs without the
      interference of other factors.

TI  - Cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase shunting lowers the anti-cancer effect of
      cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition in colorectal cancer cells.
PG  - 200
LID - 10.1186/1477-7819-10-200 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arachidonic acid metabolite, generated by cyclooxygenase (COX), is
      implicated in the colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis. Inhibiting COX may
      therefore have anti-carcinogenic effects. Results from use of non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs inhibiting only COX have been conflicting. It has been
      postulated that this might result from the shunting of arachidonic acid
      metabolism to the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathway. Cancer cell viability is
      promoted by 5-LOX through several mechanisms that are similar to those of
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Expression of 5-LOX is upregulated in colorectal
      adenoma and cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the shunting of
      arachidonic acid metabolism to the 5-LOX pathway by cyclooxygenase inhibition and
      to determine if this process antagonizes the anti-cancer effect in colorectal
      cancer cells. METHODS: Three colorectal cancer cell lines (HCA7, HT-29 & LoVo)
      expressing 5-LOX and different levels of COX-2 expression were used. The effects 
      of aspirin (a non-selective COX inhibitor) and rofecoxib (COX-2 selective) on
      prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) secretion were quantified by
      ELISA. Proliferation and viability were studied by quantifying double-stranded
      DNA (dsDNA) content and metabolic activity. Apoptosis was determined by annexin V
      and propidium iodide staining using confocal microscopy, and caspase-3/7 activity
      by fluorescent substrate assay. RESULTS: COX inhibitors suppressed PGE2
      production but enhanced LTB4 secretion in COX-2 expressing cell lines (P <0.001).
      The level of COX-2 expression in colorectal cancer cells did not significantly
      influence the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of COX inhibitors due 
      to the shunting mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of shunting 
      between COX and 5-LOX pathways in the presence of unilateral inhibition, and may 
      explain the conflicting anti-carcinogenic effects reported with use of COX
      inhibitors.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tivozanib is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which inhibits
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors-1, -2, and -3 at nanomolar
      concentrations. AREAS COVERED: A comprehensive MEDLINE and American Society of
      Clinical Oncology abstract search was performed to gather all relevant clinical
      and translational data related to tivozanib. We discuss pre-clinical studies
      associated with tivozanib, and the results of a Phase I assessment in advanced
      solid tumors. We highlight combination studies with tivozanib, including pairings
      of tivozanib with cytotoxic therapy in patients with colorectal cancer and breast
      cancer. A randomized discontinuation Phase II study and a randomized Phase III
      study assessing the activity of tivozanib in metastatic renal cell carcinoma
      (mRCC) are described in detail. EXPERT OPINION: Tivozanib will face the challenge
      of entering an already crowded therapeutic space in mRCC-emerging combination
      studies and biomarker assessments may distinguish this agent among other
      VEGF-TKIs. The current review will outline the development pathway of tivozanib
      to date, and offer lessons learned and future opportunities.

TI  - Can exercise ameliorate treatment toxicity during the initial phase of
      testosterone deprivation in prostate cancer patients? Is this more effective than
      delayed rehabilitation?
PG  - 432
LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-12-432 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been substantial increase in use of androgen deprivation
      therapy as adjuvant management of prostate cancer. However, this leads to a range
      of musculoskeletal toxicities including reduced bone mass and increased skeletal 
      fractures compounded with rapid metabolic alterations, including increased body
      fat, reduced lean mass, insulin resistance and negative lipoprotein profile,
      increased incidence of cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity, greater distress
      and reduced quality of life. Numerous research studies have demonstrated certain 
      exercise prescriptions to be effective at preventing or even reversing these
      treatment toxicities. However, all interventions to date have been of
      rehabilitative intent being implemented after a minimum of 3 months since
      initiation of androgen deprivation, by which time considerable physical and
      psychological health problems have manifested. The pressing question is whether
      it is more efficacious to commence exercise therapy at the same time as
      initiating androgen deprivation, so treatment induced adverse effects can be
      immediately attenuated or indeed prevented. METHODS/DESIGN: We are proposing a
      multi-site randomized controlled trial with partial crossover to examine the
      effects of timing of exercise implementation (immediate or delayed) on preserving
      long-term skeletal health, reversing short- and long-term metabolic and
      cardiovascular risk factors, and supporting mental health in men receiving
      androgen deprivation therapy. 124 men who are about to initiate androgen
      deprivation for prostate cancer will be randomized to immediate or delayed
      groups. Immediate will commence a 6-month exercise program within 7-10 days of
      their first dose. Delayed will receive usual care for 6 months and then commence 
      the exercise program for 6 months (partial cross-over). Immediate will be free to
      adopt the lifestyle of their choosing following the initial 6-month intervention.
      Measurements for primary and secondary endpoints will take place at baseline, 6
      months and 12 months. DISCUSSION: This project is unique as it explores a
      fundamental question of when exercise implementation will be of most benefit and 
      addresses both physical and psychological consequences of androgen deprivation
      initiation. The final outcome may be adjunct treatment which will reduce if not
      prevent the toxicities of androgen deprivation, ultimately resulting in reduced
      morbidity and mortality for men with prostate cancer. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Genetic polymorphisms in CYP1A1, GSTM1, GSTP1 and GSTT1 metabolic genes and risk 
      of lung cancer in Asturias.
PG  - 433
LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-12-433 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metabolic genes have been associated with the function of
      metabolizing and detoxifying environmental carcinogens. Polymorphisms present in 
      these genes could lead to changes in their metabolizing and detoxifying ability
      and thus may contribute to individual susceptibility to different types of
      cancer. We investigated if the individual and/or combined modifying effects of
      the CYP1A1 MspI T6235C, GSTM1 present/null, GSTT1 present/null and GSTP1
      Ile105Val polymorphisms are related to the risk of developing lung cancer in
      relation to tobacco consumption and occupation in Asturias, Northern Spain.
      METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study (CAPUA Study) was designed including
      789 lung cancer patients and 789 control subjects matched in ethnicity, age, sex,
      and hospital. Genotypes were determined by PCR or PCR-RFLP. Individual and
      combination effects were analysed using an unconditional logistic regression
      adjusting for age, pack-years, family history of any cancer and occupation.
      RESULTS: No statistically significant main effects were observed for the
      carcinogen metabolism genes in relation to lung cancer risk. In addition, the
      analysis did not reveal any significant gene-gene, gene-tobacco smoking or
      gene-occupational exposure interactions relative to lung cancer susceptibility.
      Lastly, no significant gene-gene combination effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These results suggest that genetic polymorphisms in the CYP1A1, GSTM1, GSTT1 and 
      GSTP1 metabolic genes were not significantly associated with lung cancer risk in 
      the current study. The results of the analysis of gene-gene interactions of
      CYP1A1 MspI T6235C, GSTM1 present/null, GSTT1 present/null and GSTP1 Ile105Val
      polymorphisms in lung cancer risk indicate that these genes do not interact in
      lung cancer development.

TI  - Family relationships and post-traumatic growth in breast cancer patients.
PG  - 298-306
AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic growth (PTG) refers to the process of attributing
      meaning to traumatic events and positive changes in life after facing trauma. A
      number of studies have already demonstrated that demographic- and
      coping-approaches related variables predict PTG, yet little is known about
      whether PTG may be predicted by family processes such as flexibility, cohesion,
      communication and satisfaction. The main purpose of the study therefore was to
      determine whether family-related factors predict PTG above and beyond demographic
      variables and coping related processes. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study included 
      190 women, breast-cancer patients, aged 31 to 83 years. Their educational level
      was representative of the educational level in the population of this age range. 
      The Participants were members of the Oncology Patients Society. Post traumatic
      growth index, FACES-IV - family relationships scale, coping response inventory,
      demographic, and illness-related questionnaires were administered after informed 
      consent was obtained. The PTG index was used as an outcome measure. RESULTS:
      Congruent with previous findings, analyses yielded weak correlations between
      demographic- and illness-related variables, and PTG. Also congruent with previous
      findings, approach related coping strategies were found to predict PTG, R squared
      =0.16, p<0.001. In addition to previous findings, family related factors
      predicted unique proportion of variance on PTG, p<0.05, with communication having
      positive and satisfaction negative load on PTG. CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that 
      family related factors predicted PTG above and beyond coping-related strategies
      and demographics. Communication, however, seems to mediate the association
      between satisfaction and PTG. Theoretical concerns and practical implications are
      discussed.

AB  - Stemming from the need to score relations between functional groups of genes and 
      multiple clinical types associated with a tumour, this study proposes to use
      contingency-based measures to quantify such relations. It aims at reflecting a
      relative measure of association within a specific set of functional groups, and a
      specific set of clinical statuses. The proposed methodology is based on
      extracting features (scores) from expression sets that relate genes to multiple
      cancer subtypes (clinical statuses), and use those features (scores) to associate
      cancer subtypes with functional groups. It proposes combining t-test scores at
      several levels of cancer statuses' differentiation to calculate such gene
      features. It also proposes using contingency based measures as Jaccard and
      F-measure to associate gene functional groups to multiple cancer
      subtypes/statuses. Variations from the original Jaccard measure are proposed to
      reflect scores of genes' relations to classes/groups rather than using binary
      relations. The core objective of the experimental study is to identify the
      functional categories of genes that mark the change in lymph node status under
      each of oestrogen receptor positive and negative statuses in breast cancer
      expression sets.

TI  - Clinical and diagnostic assessment for therapeutic decisions in prostate cancer.
PG  - 321-30
AB  - Due to the heterogeneity of prostate cancer (PCa) outcomes, there is a need for
      individualized treatment plans based on clinical and cancer characteristics.
      Recent advances in sophisticated imaging modalities have improved the ability to 
      stratify patients according to their risk of PCa diagnosis and progression. This,
      in turn, has positively influenced the clinical decision making process. However,
      there is also an overuse of diagnostic imaging in the evaluation of PCa patients.
      Baseline diagnostic and re-staging evaluations need to be indeed personalized, in
      order to maximize the results and reduce unnecessary, lengthy and costly
      procedures. The aim of this review was to critically evaluate current
      international guidelines in order to identify clinical and diagnostic markers
      that might help clinicians in the selection of the most appropriate imaging
      approach. For this aim, different imaging modalities were analyzed in patients
      with newly diagnosed PCa, focusing on local, nodal and distant staging. Every
      step of staging was taken into consideration based on patient individualized
      risk, as defined by routinely available clinical variables. Second, different
      imaging techniques were also reviewed in the context of relapse after primary
      treatment, highlighting their utility and impact in the clinical decision making 
      process. This review focuses mainly on conventional established imaging
      techniques, with an eye also to novel approaches that still need to be validated 
      on large patient series.

TI  - Conventional imaging and multiparametric magnetic resonance (MRI, MRS, DWI, MRP) 
      in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.
PG  - 331-42
AB  - The evaluation and management of prostate cancer (PCa) are based mainly on
      parameters such as the serum prostate-specific antigen level, clinical stage, and
      pathologic findings at biopsy or after surgery. The aim of this paper was to
      review the current roles of conventional imaging and multiparametric magnetic
      resonance imaging (mpMRI) techniques in the diagnosis of PCa. A non systematic
      literature search using the Medline and Cochrane Library databases was performed 
      up to January 2012. Bibliographies of retrieved articles and review articles were
      also examined. Only those articles reporting complete data with clinical
      relevance for the present review (i.e., diagnosis, staging) were selected. The
      advent of a high performance (1.5T) and higher fields strength (3T), and thus,
      higher spatial resolution, increased the potentiality and the diffusion of MR
      examinations. Intense research has focused on the use of complementary techniques
      to improve the detection, characterization, and staging of PCa by MRI. This
      review article is divided into two major parts: the first one considers the
      technical aspects of mpMRI; the second part is intended to provide the impact of 
      this technique on patients with PCa. Published data indicate an emerging role for
      MRI (particularly mpMRI combining T2 weighted imaging, diffusion weighted
      imaging, contrast enhanced MR, and spectroscopy) as the most sensitive and
      specific tool available for imaging PCa. MpMRI can provide metabolic information,
      characterize tissue and tumor vascularity, as well as tissue cellularity and
      correlate with tumor aggressiveness.

PG  - 343-53
AB  - As prostate cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer in men and constitutes
      the third most common cause of cancer associated deaths, early diagnosis of
      primary prostate cancer and accurate staging influencing the appropriate choice
      of therapy is crucial. PET and PET/CT using [11C]- and [18F]-labelled choline
      derivates are increasingly being used for imaging primary and recurrent prostate 
      cancer. The value of [11C]- and [18F]choline PET and PET/CT in patients with
      biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer has been evaluated in many studies and 
      shows an increasing importance. Morphological imaging techniques such as TRUS, CT
      and MRI (including functional imaging tools) have shown only limited accuracy for
      the diagnosis of primary prostate cancer. Molecular imaging techniques such as
      PET and PET/CT may improve the detection rate and localization of primary
      prostate cancer. The potential of PET/CT using [11C]- and [18F]-labelled choline 
      derivates for the diagnosis of primary prostate cancer has been assessed in a lot
      of studies with partly controversial results. [11C]- and [18F]choline PET and
      PET/CT demonstrated moderate sensitivity for the detection of primary prostate
      cancer, which depends on the tumour configuration. Furthermore the detection rate
      is limited by a considerable number of microcarcinomas that can often not be
      visualized due to partial volume effects. Therefore small and in part rind-like
      tumours can often not be detected. Additionally, specificity of [11C]- and
      [18F]choline PET and PET/CT is limited as differentiation between benign
      prostatic changes like prostatitis, prostatic hyperplasia and high-grade
      intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) is not always possible. At the present time,
      the routine use of PET/CT with [11C]- and [18F]-labelled choline derivates can
      not be recommended as a first-line screening procedure for primary prostate
      cancer in men at risk. However, choline PET and PET/CT may be useful in
      preparation of a focused re-biopsy in patients suffering from clinically
      suspected prostate cancer with repeatedly negative prostate biopsies. In the
      future [11C]- and [18F]choline PET and PET/CT may also be helpful in patient
      stratification with respect to primary surgery and radiation therapy.

TI  - Restaging prostate cancer patients with biochemical failure with PET/CT and
      radiolabeled choline.
PG  - 354-66
AB  - PET/CT with either [11C]choline or [18F]fluorocholine represents a powerful
      technique for restaging prostate cancer (PCa) patients with biochemical failure. 
      The availability of dedicated PET/CT scanners allows fusioning of morphological
      and functional images, which enables accurate localization of sites of
      pathological tracer uptake and ease the differentiation between malignant and
      benign findings. A noteworthy advantage of this whole-body technique is that it
      provides information on multiple anatomic sites at a single time. As such, the
      technique has the capability of distinguishing between local relapse and distant 
      metastases, and therefore has the potential to guide the medical treatment. The
      positive detection rate of [11C]choline PET/CT varies substantially in relation
      to the inclusion criteria. Studies which included unselected consecutive patients
      reported a positive detection rate ranging between 40% and 70%. Serum PSA level
      represents the single, most important factor affecting the rate of positive
      scans. Other positive predicitive factors include fast PSA kinetics (PSA
      velocity, PSA doubling time), advanced pathological state at initial staging,
      previous biochemical failure, hormone resistance and older age. Recent studies
      indicate that [11C]choline PET/CT has the potential to early restaging PCa
      patients for PSA levels lower than 1-1.5 ng/mL. However, more studies are
      necessary to better define the potential of this technique for low PSA levels.
      The previously cited risk factors can be used to identify patients that are at
      greater risk and that might best benefit from PET/CT scans. Patients that develop
      biochemical failure during androgen deprivation therapy (hormone resistance) have
      a higher likelihood for a positive [11C]choline PET/CT scan in comparison to
      patients that are drug naive (hormone sensitive) and are not required to withdraw
      the anti-androgenic treatment before PET/CT.

TI  - PET/CT in prostate cancer: non-choline radiopharmaceuticals.
PG  - 367-74
AB  - In this brief review, the major potential clinical applications of 18F-FDG,
      11C-acetate, 18F-FDHT, 18F-FLT, 18F-FMAU, and anti-18F-FACBC in the imaging
      evaluation of men with prostate cancer are discussed. 18F-FDG has a limited role 
      in primary diagnosis and staging but it may be able to reflect tumour
      aggressiveness, detect sites of recurrence in some men with high serum PSA after 
      biochemical failure and assess response to chemo- and hormonal treatment in
      metastatic disease. 11C-acetate has been investigated for intra-prostatic primary
      tumour detection and staging as well as for re-staging in case of biochemical
      relapse with results that are overall similar to those with 18F- and 11C-labeled 
      choline. 18F-FDHT targets the androgen receptor and may be particularly useful in
      the assessment of the pharmacodynamics of the androgen signalling pathway. PET in
      conjunction with 18F-FLT or 18F-FMAU that track the thymidine salvage pathway of 
      DNA synthesis has also been investigated for imaging cellular proliferation in
      prostate cancer. Initial experience with the radiolabeled synthetic amino acid,
      anti-18F-FACBC, which displays slow urinary excretion has been encouraging but
      further studies will be needed to decipher its exact role in the imaging
      management of men with prostate cancer.

TI  - Comparison of 18F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography and
      computed tomography in patients with already-treated breast cancer: diagnostic
      and prognostic implications.
PG  - 375-84
AB  - AIM: The purpose of the study was to assess the comparison of 18F-FDG PET/CT and 
      CT in patients with breast cancer (BC) already treated with primary therapy, in
      evaluating the diagnostic and prognostic values. METHODS: We retrospectively
      studied 190 patients (187 women and 3 men, mean age 61+/-11 years) with previous 
      BC (all stages) after surgery and other primary treatments. They underwent within
      three months CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT examinations for the evaluation of disease
      status. Disease relapse was confirmed by clinical evaluation and/or radiological 
      findings. Survival curves of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival
      (OS) were computed using Kaplan-Meier method. Cox analysis regression was used to
      determine predictive factors of DFS and OS. RESULTS: Of the overall 190 patients,
      82 (43%) had evidence of clinical and/or imaging disease relapse, while 108 (57%)
      did not. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive and positive predictive
      values for disease relapse or progression were of 89% vs. 77%, 73% vs. 53%, 90%
      vs. 75% and 72% vs. 55%, respectively for PET/CT and CT. DFS curves were
      significantly different in patients with both negative and positive PET/CT and CT
      (log-rank test 33.6; P<0.0001 and 12.7; P=0.003, respectively). OS curves were
      similar in patients with positive/negative PET/CT and CT (P=NS). By both
      univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis positive PET/CT was found to 
      be related to the disease recurrence (HR 0.18 and 0.20, both P<0.0001,
      respectively). CONCLUSION: PET/CT is more accurate than CT in identification of
      disease relapse in a large population of BC patients. In women at high-risk of
      recurrence, PET/CT imaging can provide the early detection of BC metastases,
      tailoring a proper treatment.

TI  - Postvaccination serologic testing results for infants aged </=24 months exposed
      to hepatitis B virus at birth: United States, 2008-2011.
PG  - 768-71
AB  - An estimated 25,000 infants are born to hepatitis B surface antigen
      (HBsAg)-positive women annually in the United States. With no intervention,
      40%-90% of these infants will acquire hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.
      Approximately 90% of infected infants develop chronic HBV infection, with a
      15%-25% risk for premature death from cirrhosis or cancer of the liver. To
      prevent perinatal HBV transmission, the Advisory Committee on Immunization
      Practices (ACIP) recommends that infants born to HBsAg-positive women receive
      postexposure prophylaxis with hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) and hepatitis B immune
      globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth, and complete the 3-dose HepB series. To
      determine infant outcomes after postexposure prophylaxis, ACIP recommends
      postvaccination serologic testing (PVST) at age 9-18 months. To evaluate the
      implementation of these recommendations, CDC assessed outcomes at age 24 months
      (through 2011) among infants born to HBsAg-positive women enrolled during
      2008-2009 in Enhanced Perinatal Hepatitis B Case Management Projects (EPHBP). Of 
      4,214 EPHBP-managed infants who completed >/=3 HepB doses, 63.7% had reported
      PVST results, 13.3% had reported PVST results but infant age was unknown, and
      23.0% had no reported PVST results. Of 2,683 infants with PVST results by age 24 
      months, 93.3% were protected, 1.2% were infected, 3.2% remained susceptible, and 
      2.3% had indeterminate results. ACIP-recommended postexposure prophylaxis was
      highly effective among infants who completed vaccination and received PVST. PVST 
      is critical for guiding medical management of infants born to HBsAg-positive
      women, identifying infants with HBV infection and in need of further care, and
      monitoring progress toward the elimination of perinatal HBV transmission.

      remodeling extracellular matrices (ECM) and its significant impact on the
      metastasis/invasion of epithelial ovarian cancer cells via beta1
      integrin/phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) signaling. MATERIALS/METHODS:
      Normal ovarian surface epithelium tissues (n = 13), ovarian cancer tissues (n =
      28), ovarian cancer cell lines, and a 3-dimensional model of fibrillar type I
      collagen that mimicked pathological ECM in vivo were used in the study. We
      explored the specific mechanisms behind ECM remodeling and the cellular signals
      that affected the invasion of ovarian cancer cells. RESULTS: The data showed that
      increased beta1 integrin expression in ovarian cancer cells led to enhance
      migration/invasion of ovarian cancer cells via regulation of PTEN/protein kinase 
      B (Akt) signal in response to fibrillar type I collagen matrices. Low PTEN
      activity corresponded to the following: (1) increased PTEN degradation and (2)
      phosphorylation of PTEN. Decreased protein phosphatase 2A activity was detected
      in ovarian cancer. Protein phosphatase 2A might play a role in enhancing the
      progression of ovarian cancer through regulating PTEN/Akt signal. CONCLUSION:
      These findings indicate that fibrillar type I collagen, by modulating
      integrin-PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in remodeling ECM, is very important in 
      affecting the invasion of aggressive ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, these data
      provide direct evidence for pathological ECM remodeling and cell signaling
      networks involved in the invasion of ovarian cancer cells.

TI  - Racial differences in oncogene mutations detected in early-stage low-grade
      endometrial cancers.
PG  - 1367-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the pattern and frequency of oncogene mutations in white
      and African American women with endometrial cancer and to determine if racial
      differences in oncogene mutations exist among women with pathologically similar
      tumors. METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer from a large urban hospital
      were identified through medical records, and representative formalin-fixed
      paraffin-embedded tumor blocks were retrieved. The study sample included 150
      patients (84 African Americans) who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy for
      endometrial cancer. The Sequenom MassARRAY system and the OncoCarta Assay version
      1.0 (Sequenom) were used to test for 238 mutations in 19 common oncogenes. The
      chi(2) test and the Fisher exact test were used to assess differences in
      distribution of variables by race and oncogene mutation status. RESULTS: There
      were 20 mutations identified in 2 oncogenes (PIK3CA and KRAS) in tumors from 19
      women (12.7%). Most of the mutations were found in PIK3CA (16/20). Thirteen
      percent of endometrioid tumors harbored mutations (11 PIK3CA and 2 KRAS) as did
      29% of the malignant mixed Mullerian tumors (3 PIK3CA and 1 KRAS). There were no 
      observed mutations in serous, clear cell, or mucinous tumor types. Among
      low-grade endometrioid cancers, tumors from African American patients were
      significantly associated with harboring either a KRAS or PIK3CA mutation (P =
      0.04), with 7 PIK3CA mutations and all 4 KRAS mutations identified in African
      American women. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that
      oncogene mutation frequency of some subtypes of histologically similar
      endometrial carcinoma differ by race. Additional studies are needed to further
      explore this phenomenon in patients with endometrial carcinoma.

TI  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) and HPV 16-variant distribution in vulvar squamous
      cell carcinoma in Sweden.
PG  - 1413-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the human papillomavirus (HPV) and HPV type 16-variant 
      distribution in a series of vulvar squamous cell carcinomas (VSCC) and to
      evaluate the impact of HPV and HPV 16-variant on prognosis. METHODS: A series of 
      133 patients who had a diagnosis of VSCC (1983-2008) was selected for the study. 
      Detection of 11 high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 
      59) and 2 low-risk HPV types (6 and 11) was performed with real-time polymerase
      chain reaction. Samples positive for HPV 16 were further analyzed for variant
      determination of 7 positions in the E6 gene with polymerase chain reaction and
      pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Forty (30.8%) of 130 tumors were found to be HPV
      positive. Human papillomavirus type 16 was found in 31 cases, HPV 18 was found in
      2 cases, HPV 33 was found in 5 cases, and HPV 56 and HPV 59 were found in one
      case each. All but one tumor harboring HPV 16 were of European linage, and the 3 
      most common variants were E-p (n = 13), E-G350 (n = 7), and E-G131 (n = 5). HPV
      positivity was associated with the basaloid tumor type and occurred in
      significantly younger patients. Overall and recurrence-free survival rates were
      better in HPV-positive cases, but after correction for age and tumor size, HPV
      status was no longer an independent and significant prognostic factor. The
      survival rates of the various HPV 16 variants were not significantly different,
      but there was a trend of worse outcome for the E-G131-variant group. CONCLUSIONS:
      Human papillomavirus positivity of 30.8% is similar to other reports on VSCC. To 
      our knowledge, this first variant determination of HPV 16 in vulvar carcinoma in 
      a Swedish cohort indicated that the variant E-G131 may have an increased
      oncogenic potential in patients with VSCC.

TI  - Ovarian cancer: prevention, detection, and treatment of the disease and its
      recurrence. Molecular mechanisms and personalized medicine meeting report.
PG  - S45-57
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the current understanding of the underlying molecular,
      biologic, and genetic mechanisms involved in ovarian cancer development and how
      these mechanisms can be targets for prevention, detection, and treatment of the
      disease and its recurrence. METHODS: In May 2012, we convened a meeting of
      researchers, clinicians, and consumer advocates to review the state of current
      knowledge on molecular mechanisms and identify fruitful areas for further
      investigations. RESULTS: The meeting consisted of 7 scientific sessions ranging
      from Epidemiology, Early Detection, and Biology to Therapeutics and Quality of
      Life. Sessions consisted of talks and panel discussions by international leaders 
      in ovarian cancer research. A special career development session by the
      Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program Department of Defense Ovarian
      Cancer Academy as well as an oral abstract and poster session showcased promising
      new research by junior scientists. CONCLUSIONS: Technological advances in the
      last decade have increased our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in 
      a host of biological activities related to ovarian cancer. Understanding the role
      these mechanisms play in cancer initiation and progression will help lead to the 
      development of prevention and treatment modalities that can be personalized to
      each patient, thereby helping to overcome this highly fatal malignancy.

PG  - 331-9
LID - 10.1017/S1478951512000661 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Prostate cancer, one of the most common cancers in men, is often
      treated with radiotherapy, which strains both physical and mental health. This
      study aimed to describe the experiences of men living with prostate cancer shared
      within conversational support groups during a course of radiotherapy. METHOD:
      Nine men participated in one of two groups that met six or seven times, led by a 
      professional nurse. Qualitative content analysis was used to identify themes and 
      subthemes in the recorded group conversations. RESULTS: The analysis resulted in 
      six themes: living with a changing body, being in the hands of others, learning
      to live with the disease, the importance of knowledge, everyday life support, and
      meeting in the support group. The men discussed a wide variety of bodily
      experiences and described support from healthcare professionals, relatives,
      friends, and the support group as crucial to their recovery. SIGNIFICANCE OF
      RESULTS: Meeting men in a similar situation, sharing experiences of living with
      the disease, and feeling allied to each other were important to the men in our
      study. The conversational support group provided the patient with prostate cancer
      a forum where sharing was made possible.

TI  - Extracellular acidity as favouring factor of tumor progression and metastatic
      dissemination.
PG  - 79-84
AB  - The bidirectional interactions between tumor cells and the so-called "host
      reactive stroma" play a critical role in most of the events characterizing tumor 
      progression and distant organ colonization. This review discusses critical
      components of tumor environment involved in tumor cell dissemination. More
      specifically, it addresses some of the experimental evidences providing that
      acidity of tumor environment facilitates local invasiveness and metastasis
      formation, independently from hypoxia, with which acidity may be associated.
      Besides, acidity renders tumor cells resistant to radiation therapy and
      chemotherapeutic drugs. Therefore, this review examines the strategies for
      raising the low extracellular pH of tumors that might have considerable potential
      in cancer therapy.

      AND METHODS: Parental (MCF-7/S) and resistant to cisplatin (MCF-7/CP) and
      doxorubicin (MCF-7/Dox) human breast cancer cells were used in the study.
      Cholesterol, total lipids and phospholipids content were determined by means of
      thin-layer chromatography. RESULTS: It was found that cholesterol as well as
      cholesterol ethers content are significantly higher but diacylglycerols,
      triacyl-glycerols content are significantly lower in resistant cell strains than 
      in parental (sensitive) cells. Moreover the analysis of individual phospholipids 
      showed the increase of sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserine, cardiolipin,
      phosphatidic acid and the decrease of phosphatidy-lethanolamine,
      phosphatidylcholine in MCF-7/CP and MCF-7/Dox cells. CONCLUSION: Obtained results
      allow to suggest that the lipid profile changes can mediate the modulation of
      membrane fluidity in drug resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cells.

      human breast cancer cells.
PG  - 101-6
AB  - UNLABELLED: The aim of this research is to study the dynamics and efficiency of
      liposome accumulation in sensitive and resistant human breast cancer cells.
      METHODS: Methods of fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence microspectroscopy and
      MTT-test have been used. RESULTS: The liposome-to-cell interaction and dye
      cellular uptake in sensitive, cisplatin-resistant and doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7
      human breast cancer cells have been analyzed using time changes in both
      fluorescence resonance energy transfer signal from the donor probe DiO to the
      acceptor one DiI preloaded in liposomes and cell image brightness. CONCLUSION:
      Obtained results show that resistant cells accumulate dye-loaded liposomes more
      effectively and reveal more effective dye molecule cellular uptake.

TI  - Cancer incidence and nuclear facilities in Ukraine: a community-based study.
PG  - 116-20
AB  - UNLABELLED: The study goal was to investigate malignant tumors incidence in 5
      Ukrainian cities with nuclear hazardous enterprises: extractive, processing
      enterprises of uranium ore (Zhovti Wody and Dniprodzerzhynsk of Dnipropetrovsk
      region) and nuclear power stations (Energodar of Zaporizhska region,
      Pivdennoukrainsk of Mykolayivska region, Netishyn of Khmelnytska region).
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: average annual population of the cities under study in
      2003-2008 was 439 600 persons. Total and specific cancer incidence was
      investigated. Site specific incidence was analyzed for malignancies proved to be 
      radiosensitive in previous studies: trachea, bronchus and lung, breast, kidney,
      thyroid cancer and leukemia. Data on cancer cases were received in National
      Cancer Registry of Ukraine (National Cancer Institute). There was used the data
      of the State Statistics Committee of Ukraine on the size of the studied
      population by gender - age groups. Standardized incidence ratio of cancer at a
      whole and for each of five specific forms of malignancies were calculated for the
      population of each city and group of cities depending on the nature of industrial
      activity. RESULTS: During the observed period there were registered 9 381 cancer 
      cases in inhabitants of Ukrainian cities with radiation hazardous facilities.
      There was stated that cancer incidence rate in population of 5 cities
      significantly exceeded national and regional levels. Among specific forms of
      malignancy there were observed excess of lung, trachea, bronchus, breast, kidney 
      cancer and leukemia in population of extractive, processing uranium ore cities.
      No excess of thyroid cancer was identified. In cities with nuclear power station 
      there were registered excess of kidney cancer. CONCLUSION: Results of the study
      suggest the necessity to explore the role of various factors in forming the
      identified cancer incidence features in the Ukrainian population living near the 
      nuclear power facilities.

TI  - Chromosomal radiosensitivity in Ukrainian breast cancer patients and healthy
      individuals.
PG  - 121-4
AB  - AIM: Recent studies showed that increased chromosomal damage induced by ionizing 
      radiation is observed among patients with different tumor types. The aim of the
      study was evaluation of chromosomal radiosensitivity in breast cancer (BC)
      patients (n = 37) and healthy women (n = 44). METHODS: Chromosomal
      radiosensitivity was assessed with G0 and G2 assay. For G0 assay lymphocytes were
      exposed in vitro to 1,5 Gy of X-rays before culture setting. For G2 assay
      lymphocytes were irradiated with 0,5 Gy of X-rays after 47 h of incubation.
      RESULTS: Significant differences in mean scores both of G0 and G2 assay between
      breast cancer patients and controls were observed indicating the increased
      chromosomal radiosensitivity of lymphocytes of cancer patients. 11% of healthy
      women and 38% of BC patients were determined to be radiosensitive with G2 assay. 
      CONCLUSION: Obtained results support the concept of association between elevated 
      individual G2 chromosomal radiosensitivity and predisposition to BC.

TI  - Thyroid metastases from a breast cancer diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration
      biopsy. Case report and overview of the literature.
PG  - 129-33
AB  - AIM: Intrathyroid metastases are uncommon in cytology practice. We report a case 
      of metastatic lesion in the thyroid from breast carcinoma which was recognized in
      a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy and confirmed by immunohistopathology. In
      addition, we provide an overview of the literature describing similar cases.
      STUDY DESIGN: The patient was a 54-year old woman with a large, multinodular
      goiter and bilaterally enlarged lymph nodes in the supraclavicular areas.
      Fourteen years earlier she had undergone radical mastectomy followed by chemio-
      and radiotherapy due to a breast carcinoma. RESULTS: FNA of the thyroid nodules
      showed a metastatic breast carcinoma and was followed by total strumectomy and
      lymphadenectomy. Histological reassessment of the surgical thyroid specimens as
      well as the neck lymph nodes revealed multiple breast metastases. This was
      strongly confirmed by immunohistochemical examinations, which revealed a positive
      staining for: CKMNF 116, CK7, CEA as well as for ER, PgR and HER2, and a negative
      staining for: CK20, thyroglobulin, TTF1, calcitonin, and chromogranin.
      CONCLUSION: Every new aggregate in the thyroid in patients with even a long-term 
      history of cancer should be considered as potentially metastatic until proved
      otherwise. FNA could be helpful in the diagnosis of thyroid metastatic lesion,
      but it should be confirmed by immunohistopathology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prognostic significance of tumor necrosis factor
      receptor (TNFR),-associated factor 6 (TRAF6),-and ubiquitin in gastric cancer
      patients. METHODS: Biopsies of the rectus abdominis muscle were obtained intra
      operatively from 102 gastric cancer patients and 29 subjects undergoing surgery
      for benign abdominal diseases, and muscle TRAF6 and ubiquitin mRNA expression and
      proteasome proteolytic activities were assessed. RESULTS: TRAF6 was significantly
      upregulated in muscle of gastric cancer compared with the control muscles. TRAF6 
      was upregulated in 67.65% (69/102) muscle of gastric cancer. Over expression of
      TRAF6 in muscles of gastric cancer were associated with TNM stage, level of serum
      albumin and percent of weight loss. Ubiquitin was significantly upregulated in
      muscle of gastric cancer compared with the control muscles. Ubiquitin was
      upregulated in 58.82% (60/102) muscles of gastric cancer. Over expression of
      ubiquitin in muscles of gastric cancer were associated with TNM
      (Tumor-Node-Metastasis) stage and weight loss. There was significant relation
      between TRAF6 and ubiquitin expression. CONCLUSIONS: We found a positive
      correlation between TRAF6 and ubiquitin expression, suggesting that TRAF6 may up 
      regulates ubiquitin activity in cancer cachexia. While more investigations are
      required to understand its mechanisms of TRAF6 and ubiquitin in skeletal muscle. 
      Correct the catabolic-anabolic imbalance is essential for the effective treatment
      of cancer cachexia.

TI  - In vitro estrogenicity of dental resin sealants.
PG  - 312-6
AB  - PURPOSE: This investigation assessed the estrogenic action of various types of
      sealants. METHODS: Three light-cured sealants (Denton Clear, Delton Opaque,
      Ultraseal XT Plus) were applied in polyethylene molds (O:10mm, h:2mm, n:8) and
      photopolymerized (40 seconds, halogen bulb unit, standard mode 650 mW/cm 2
      intensity). All specimens were immersed in normal saline for 1 week at 37 degrees
      C. Samples of eluents at concentrations of 5% and 10% (volume per volume) were
      tested for estrogenicity by measuring their effect on the proliferation of the
      estrogen responsive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In addition, an estrogen
      insensitive cell line was used as a control (MDA-MB-231) to exclude a possible
      cytostatic effect of the tested materials. All assays were repeated 4 times, and 
      results analyzed with a 2-way analysis of variance and Tukey's test at the 0.05
      level. RESULTS: Eluents of the sealants tested at concentrations of 5% and 10%
      did not possess estrogenicity, except for the eluent of one sealant (Delton
      Opaque) at concentration 10%, which caused an induction of the proliferation rate
      of the MCF-7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Eluents of sealants tested at a concentration of
      5% had no estrogenic activity. The eluent of Delton Opaque at a concentration of 
      10% possessed some estrogenic activity.

      patients with lymphoma, multiple myeloma or acute leukemia. RECENT FINDINGS:
      Hematologic malignancies are associated with a high risk of thrombotic
      complications. The incidence of these events is greatly variable and is
      influenced by many factors, including the type and the stage of disease,
      antitumor therapies, and the use of central venous device (CVD). Epidemiological 
      data allow an estimate of the incidence of VTE in acute leukemia, lymphomas, and 
      multiple myeloma. The effect of chemotherapy on the incidence of thrombosis is
      particularly evident in acute leukemia as it causes the exacerbation of the
      clotting/bleeding syndrome typical of this disease. The role of chemotherapy is
      also relevant in lymphoma, and in multiple myeloma, in which the use of
      immunomodulating agents, in combination with chemotherapy and steroids
      significantly increases the risk of VTE. SUMMARY: Thrombotic complications have a
      significant impact on morbidity and mortality of hematological cancer patients,
      therefore, in this setting, the issue of thromboprophylaxis to prevent VTE is
      important. However, no clear recommendation in these conditions is available,
      with the exception of multiple myeloma. Large prospective randomized clinical
      trials are needed to establish the best practice for prevention and treatment of 
      VTE in these types of malignant diseases.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We are currently on the threshold of a revolution in breast
      cancer research, thanks to the emergence of novel technologies based on
      next-generation sequencing (NGS). In this review, we will describe the different 
      sequencing technologies and platforms, and summarize the main findings from the
      latest sequencing articles in breast cancer. RECENT FINDINGS: Firstly, the
      sequencing of a few hundreds of breast tumors has revealed new cancer genes.
      Although these were not frequently mutated, mutated genes from different patients
      could be grouped into the deregulation of similar pathways. Secondly, NGS allowed
      further exploration of intratumor heterogeneity and revealed that although
      subclonal mutations were present in all tumors, there was always a dominant
      clone, which comprised at least 50% of the tumor cells. Finally, tumor-specific
      DNA rearrangements could be detected in the patient's plasma, suggesting that NGS
      could be used to personalize the monitoring of the disease. SUMMARY: The
      application of NGS to breast cancer has been associated with tremendous advances 
      and promises for increasing the understanding of the disease. However, there
      still remain many unanswered questions, such as the role of structural changes of
      tumor genomes in cancer progression and treatment response/resistance.

TI  - Methods to improve adoptive T-cell therapy for melanoma: IFN-gamma enhances
      anticancer responses of cell products for infusion.
PG  - 545-52
LID - 10.1038/jid.2012.336 [doi]
AB  - Further development of adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT) with autologous
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has the potential to markedly change the
      long-term prognosis of patients with metastatic melanoma, and modifications of
      the original protocol that can improve its clinical efficacy are highly
      desirable. In this study, we demonstrated that a high in vitro tumor reactivity
      of infusion products was associated with clinical responses upon adoptive
      transfer. In addition, we systematically characterized the responses of a series 
      of TIL products to relevant autologous short term-cultured melanoma cell lines
      from 12 patients. We provide evidence that antitumor reactivity of both CD8(+)
      and CD4(+) T cells could be enhanced in most TIL products by autologous melanoma 
      sensitization by pretreatment with low-dose IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma selectively
      enhanced responses to tumor-associated antigens other than melanoma
      differentiation antigens. In addition, IFN-gamma treatment was invariably
      associated with restored/increased cancer immunogenicity as demonstrated by
      upregulation of major histocompatibility complex molecules. These findings
      suggest a potential synergism between IFN-gamma and ACT, and have important
      implications for clinical development of combination strategies for the treatment
      of metastatic melanoma.

TI  - Recombinant VAA-I from Viscum album induces apoptotic cell death of
      hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC7721 cells.
PG  - 11435-46
LID - 10.3390/molecules171011435 [doi]
AB  - Researchers have proposed that VAA-I, a specific plant lectin found in Viscum
      album, has therapeutic effects on cancer and autoimmune diseases. VAA-I has shown
      some promising treatment results in some types of tumor cell lines, especially
      SMMC-7721 cells (human hepatocellular carcinoma cells). However, few details are 
      known about the mechanism and process of cell death induced by VAA-I in tumor
      cells. In this study, the cell morphology results showed that SMMC-7721 cells
      treated with VAA-I exhibited several features typical of apoptotic cell death,
      which was confirmed by the Caspase inhibition assay. Fluo-3-acetoxymethyl ester
      (AM) fluorescence imaging techniques showed that rVAA-I significantly elevated
      the intracellular calcium level ([Ca2+]i) in SMMC-7721 cells. These findings
      suggest that apoptosis may play the most important role in SMMC-7721 cell death
      induced by rVAA-I. Finally, in the SMMC-7721 cells treated with rVAA-I, a series 
      of genes in the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway
      were expressed differentially, and further found that PI 3-kinase pathway is
      involved in rVAA-I signal transduction in SMMC-7721 cells.

TI  - Loss of heterozygosity at tumor suppressor genes detectable on fractionated
      circulating cell-free tumor DNA as indicator of breast cancer progression.
PG  - 5719-30
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0142 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: LOH on circulating DNA may provide tumor-specific information on breast 
      cancer. As identification of LOH on cell-free DNA is impeded by the prevalence of
      wild type DNA in blood of cancer patients, we fractionated plasma DNA, and
      determined the diagnostic and prognostic value of both fractions. EXPERIMENTAL
      DESIGN: Our cohort of 388 patients with primary breast cancer before chemotherapy
      was selected from a multicenter study (SUCCESS). Postoperative plasma was
      fractionated in low- and high-molecular weight DNA by two different column
      systems. In both fractions, LOH was determined by a PCR-based microsatellite
      analysis using a panel of 8 polymorphic markers. Circulating tumor DNA in plasma 
      from 30 patients after chemotherapy was additionally analyzed. The significance
      levels were adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: More patients (38%) had
      LOH at all markers in the fraction containing short DNA fragments than in the
      fraction containing the long DNA molecules (28%, P = 0.0001). In both fractions
      32.85% of LOH were concordant. LOH at the markers D3S1605, D10S1765, D12S1725,
      D13S218, and D17S855 significantly correlated with tumor stage, tumor size, and
      lymph node metastasis, positive progesterone, and HER2 receptor status. Most
      importantly, LOH at D12S1725 mapping to cyclin D2 correlated with shorter overall
      survival (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The improved detection of LOH on cell-free DNA
      provides important information on DNA losses of tumor suppressor genes TIG1,
      PTEN, cyclin D2, RB1, and BRCA1 in breast cancer. In particular, loss of the
      cyclin D2 gene might become an important prognostic marker easily detectable in
      the peripheral blood.

TI  - Challenges in the enumeration and phenotyping of CTC.
PG  - 5711-8
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1585 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Presence of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in metastatic carcinoma is
      associated with poor survival. Phenotyping and genotyping of CTC may permit
      "real-time" treatment decisions, provided CTCs are available for examination.
      Here, we investigate what is needed to detect CTC in all patients. EXPERIMENTAL
      DESIGN: CTCs enumerated in 7.5 mL of blood together with survival from 836
      patients with metastatic breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer were used to
      predict the CTC concentration in the 42% of these patients in whom no CTCs were
      found and to establish the relation of concentration of CTCs with survival.
      Influence of different CTC definitions were investigated by automated cell
      recognition and a flow cytometric assay without an enrichment or permeabilization
      step. RESULTS: A log-logistic regression of the log of CTC yielded a good fit to 
      the CTC frequency distribution. Extrapolation of the blood volume to 5 L
      predicted that 99% of patients had at least one CTC before therapy initiation.
      Survival of patients with EpCAM+, cytokeratin+, CD45- nucleated CTCs is reduced
      by 6.6 months for each 10-fold CTC increase. Using flow cytometry, the potential 
      three-fold recovery improvement is not sufficient to detect CTC in all patients
      in 7.5 mL of blood. CONCLUSIONS: EpCAM+, cytokeratin+, CD45- nucleated CTCs are
      present in all patients with metastatic breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer
      and their frequency is proportional to survival. To serve as a liquid biopsy for 
      the majority of patients, a substantial improvement of CTC yield is needed, which
      can only be achieved by a dramatic increase in sample volume.

AB  - PURPOSE: Natural killer (NK) cells are a key element of the innate immune system 
      implicated in human cancer. To examine NK cell levels in archived bloods from a
      study of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a new DNA-based
      quantification method was developed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: NK cell-specific DNA
      methylation was identified by analyzing DNA methylation and mRNA array data from 
      purified blood leukocyte subtypes (NK, T, B, monocytes, granulocytes), and
      confirmed via pyrosequencing and quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMSP). NK
      cell levels in archived whole blood DNA from 122 HNSCC patients and 122 controls 
      were assessed by qMSP. RESULTS: Pyrosequencing and qMSP confirmed that a
      demethylated DNA region in NKp46 distinguishes NK cells from other leukocytes,
      and serves as a quantitative NK cell marker. Demethylation of NKp46 was
      significantly lower in HNSCC patient bloods compared with controls (P < 0.001).
      Individuals in the lowest NK tertile had over 5-fold risk of being a HNSCC case, 
      controlling for age, gender, HPV16 status, cigarette smoking, alcohol
      consumption, and BMI (OR = 5.6, 95% CI, 2.0 to 17.4). Cases did not show
      differences in NKp46 demethylation based on tumor site or stage. CONCLUSIONS: The
      results of this study indicate a significant depression in NK cells in HNSCC
      patients that is unrelated to exposures associated with the disease. DNA
      methylation biomarkers of NK cells represent an alternative to conventional flow 
      cytometry that can be applied in a wide variety of clinical and epidemiologic
      settings including archival blood specimens.

TI  - Measurement of tumor VEGF-A levels with 89Zr-bevacizumab PET as an early
      biomarker for the antiangiogenic effect of everolimus treatment in an ovarian
      cancer xenograft model.
PG  - 6306-14
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0406 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The mTOR pathway is frequently activated in ovarian cancers. mTOR
      inhibitors, such as everolimus, can reduce VEGF-A production by cancer cells. We 
      investigated whether early everolimus treatment effects could be monitored by
      positron emission tomography (PET) with (89)Zr-bevacizumab. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: 
      The effect of everolimus on VEGF-A secretion was determined in a panel of human
      ovarian cancer cell lines and in A2780(luc+) ovarian cancer cells xenografted
      subcutaneously in BALB/c mice. Mice received daily 10 mg/kg everolimus
      intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 14 days. PET scans with the tracer (89)Zr-labeled
      bevacizumab were conducted before and after treatment. Ex vivo (89)Zr-bevacizumab
      biodistribution and correlative tissue analyses were conducted. Tumor VEGF-A
      levels were measured with ELISA and mean vascular density (MVD) was determined
      with immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Everolimus treatment reduced VEGF-A levels in
      the supernatant of all cell lines. Everolimus lowered (89)Zr-bevacizumab tumor
      uptake by 21.7% +/- 4.0% [mean standardized uptake value (SUV(mean)) 2.3 +/- 0.2 
      vs. 2.9 +/- 0.2, P < 0.01]. Ex vivo biodistribution also showed lower tracer
      uptake in the tumors of treated as compared with control animals (7.8 +/-
      0.8%ID/g vs. 14.0 +/- 1.7%ID/g, P < 0.01), whereas no differences were observed
      for other tissues. This coincided with lower VEGF-A protein levels in tumor
      lysates in treated versus untreated tumors (P = 0.04) and reduced MVD (P < 0.01).
      CONCLUSION: Tumor VEGF-A levels are decreased by everolimus. (89)Zr-bevacizumab
      PET could be used to monitor tumor VEGF-A levels as an early biomarker of the
      antiangiogenic effect of mTOR inhibitor therapy.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of EGFR and KRAS mutations in 3,026 lung adenocarcinomas: 
      higher susceptibility of women to smoking-related KRAS-mutant cancers.
PG  - 6169-77
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-3265 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The molecular epidemiology of most EGFR and KRAS mutations in lung
      cancer remains unclear. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We genotyped 3,026 lung
      adenocarcinomas for the major EGFR (exon 19 deletions and L858R) and KRAS (G12,
      G13) mutations and examined correlations with demographic, clinical, and smoking 
      history data. RESULTS: EGFR mutations were found in 43% of never smokers and in
      11% of smokers. KRAS mutations occurred in 34% of smokers and in 6% of never
      smokers. In patients with smoking histories up to 10 pack-years, EGFR
      predominated over KRAS. Among former smokers with lung cancer, multivariate
      analysis showed that, independent of pack-years, increasing smoking-free years
      raise the likelihood of EGFR mutation. Never smokers were more likely than
      smokers to have KRAS G > A transition mutation (mostly G12D; 58% vs. 20%, P =
      0.0001). KRAS G12C, the most common G > T transversion mutation in smokers, was
      more frequent in women (P = 0.007) and these women were younger than men with the
      same mutation (median 65 vs. 69, P = 0.0008) and had smoked less. CONCLUSIONS:
      The distinct types of KRAS mutations in smokers versus never smokers suggest that
      most KRAS-mutant lung cancers in never smokers are not due to second-hand smoke
      exposure. The higher frequency of KRAS G12C in women, their younger age, and
      lesser smoking history together support a heightened susceptibility to tobacco
      carcinogens.

TI  - Using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data in early decision making regarding
      drug development: a phase I clinical trial evaluating tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 
      AEE788.
PG  - 6364-72
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1499 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In this first-in-human study of AEE788, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER-2, and VEGFR-2, a comprehensive
      pharmacodynamic program was implemented in addition to the evaluation of safety, 
      pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of AEE788 in cancer patients.
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with advanced, solid tumors received escalating
      doses of oral AEE788 once daily. Primary endpoints were to determine
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). A nonlinear
      model (Emax model) was used to describe the relationship between AEE788 exposure 
      and target-pathway modulation in skin and tumor tissues. RESULTS: Overall, 111
      patients were treated (25 to 550 mg/day). DLTs included rash and diarrhea; MTD
      was 450 mg/day. Effects on biomarkers correlated to serum AEE788 concentrations. 
      The concentration at 50% inhibition (IC(50)) for EGFR in skin (0.033 mumol/L) and
      tumor (0.0125 mumol/L) were similar to IC(50) in vitro suggesting skin may be
      surrogate tissue for estimating tumor EGFR inhibition. No inhibition of p-MAPK
      and Ki67 was observed in skin vessels at </= MTD. Hence, AEE788 inhibited EGFR,
      but not VEGFR, at doses </= MTD. A total of 16 of 96 evaluable patients showed a 
      >10% shrinkage of tumor size; one partial response was observed. CONCLUSION: Our 
      pharmacodynamic-based study showed effective inhibition of EGFR, but not of VEGFR
      at tolerable AEE788 doses. Emax modeling integrated with biomarker data
      effectively guided real-time decision making in the early development of AEE788. 
      Despite clinical activity, target inhibition of only EGFR led to discontinuation 
      of further AEE788 development.

TI  - TRAIL and Noxa are selectively upregulated in prostate cancer cells downstream of
      the RIG-I/MAVS signaling pathway by nonreplicating Sendai virus particles.
PG  - 6271-83
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1595 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The treatment of cancer with oncolytic viruses primarily depends on the 
      selective viral replication in cancer cells. However, a replication-incompetent
      hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ; Sendai virus) envelope (HVJ-E) suppresses
      the growth of human cancer cells as effectively as replication-competent live HVJ
      without producing toxic effects in nonmalignant cells. Here, we analyze the
      molecular mechanism of the oncolytic activity of HVJ-E. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The 
      molecules responsible for HVJ-E-induced cancer cell death were elucidated in
      prostate cancer cell lines, and the effect of HVJ-E on orthotopic prostate
      cancers was evaluated in nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient
      (NOD-SCID) mice. RESULTS: The liposome-mediated transfer of viral RNA genome
      fragments from HVJ-E suppressed the viability of prostate cancer cells but not
      the viability of the noncancerous prostate epithelium. Knockdown experiments
      using siRNAs showed that the cancer cell-selective killing induced by HVJ-E was
      mediated by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and mitochondrial antiviral
      signaling protein (MAVS). Downstream of the RIG-I/MAVS pathway, both TNF-related 
      apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and Noxa were upregulated by HVJ-E in the
      castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line PC3 but not in the noncancerous
      prostate epithelial cell line PNT2. TRAIL siRNA but not Noxa siRNA significantly 
      inhibited HVJ-E-induced cell death in PC3 cells. However, Noxa siRNA effectively 
      suppressed HVJ-E-induced cell death in DU145 cells, another castration-resistant 
      prostate cancer cell line, in which Noxa but not TRAIL was upregulated by HVJ-E. 
      Furthermore, the orthotopic prostate cancers were dramatically eradicated in
      immunodeficient mice injected with HVJ-E. CONCLUSION: The RIG-I/MAVS signaling
      pathway represents an attractive target for cancer therapy.

AB  - PURPOSE: We analyzed the outcomes of single-agent phase II clinical trials in
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to determine trial parameters that predicted
      clinical activity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Data on response rate (RR),
      progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) from all English
      language, single-agent phase II trials in advanced/metastatic NSCLC indexed by
      PubMed (January 2000 through December 2009) were abstracted. RESULTS: A total of 
      143 single-agent phase II trials (7,701 patients) were identified. The median RR 
      was 10%, PFS 2.8 months, and OS 7.6 months. RR and PFS correlated with OS (r =
      0.46, P < 0.001, r = 0.52, P < 0.001, respectively) and RR correlated with PFS (r
      = 0.61, P < 0.001). Treatment arms enriched for patients with molecular targets
      had a higher median RR (48.8% vs. 9.7%, P = 0.005), longer median PFS (6 vs. 2.8 
      months, P = 0.005), and OS (11.3 vs. 7.5 months, P = 0.05) as compared with those
      of unselected patients. In multivariate analysis, only studies enriched for
      patients with molecular targets or including drugs that eventually gained FDA/EMA
      approval were associated with a higher RR, and longer PFS/OS. CONCLUSIONS: In
      phase II trials in NSCLC, RR and PFS correlated with OS. Studies enriched for
      patients with putative molecular drug targets were associated with higher
      therapeutic benefit as compared with those of unselected populations.

TI  - Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity overcomes NK cell resistance in
      MLL-rearranged leukemia expressing inhibitory KIR ligands but not activating
      ligands.
PG  - 6296-305
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0668 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Leukemias with MLL gene rearrangement are associated with a poor
      prognosis. Natural killer (NK) cell therapy is a potential treatment, but
      leukemia cells may be resistant. Here, we sought to determine the susceptibility 
      of MLL-rearranged leukemia cells to NK cell lysis and to develop a novel
      immunotherapeutic approach to optimize NK cell therapy, including the use of an
      antibody against leukemia-associated antigen and the elimination of killer-cell
      immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)-mediated inhibition. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
      Three MLL-rearranged leukemia cell lines (RS4;11, SEM, and MV4-11) and primary
      leukemia blasts were assessed for surface phenotype and susceptibility to NK cell
      lysis with or without antibodies against CD19 (XmAb5574), CD33 (lintuzumab), or
      KIR ligands. RESULTS: All three cell lines were resistant to NK cell lysis, had
      some inhibitory KIR ligands and protease inhibitor-9, and expressed low levels of
      NKG2D activating ligands and adhesion molecules. After treatment with XmAb5574 or
      lintuzumab, MLL-rearranged leukemia cells were efficiently killed by NK cells.
      The addition of pan-major histocompatibility complex class I antibody, which
      blocked inhibitory KIR-HLA interaction, further augmented degranulation in all
      three KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2/3, and KIR3DL1 subsets of NK cells based on the rule of
      missing-self recognition. A mouse model showed a decreased rate of leukemia
      progression in vivo as monitored by bioluminescence imaging and longer survival
      after antibody treatment. CONCLUSION: Our data support the use of a triple
      immunotherapy approach, including an antibody directed against tumor-associated
      antigen, KIR-mismatched NK cell transplantation, and inhibitory KIR blockade, for
      the treatment of NK cell-resistant MLL-rearranged leukemias.

TI  - DNA damage as a result of psychological stress: implications for breast cancer.
PG  - 320
LID - 10.1186/bcr3189 [doi]
AB  - Accumulating evidence indicates that psychological stress can have deleterious
      influences on cancer development and progression, but the mechanisms responsible 
      remain unclear. One possible mechanism is suggested by emerging evidence that DNA
      damage is increased by exposure to stress and stress hormones (for example,
      cortisol, catecholamines). Possible molecular mechanisms for such effects were
      the subject of a recent paper by Hara and colleagues, which suggests that chronic
      stress, through beta-adrenergic stimulation, can induce two synergistic pathways 
      that result in accumulation of DNA damage. Herein, we discuss the potential
      implications of these findings for breast cancer etiology, progression, and
      treatment response.

TI  - Circulating tumor cells: liquid biopsy of cancer.
PG  - 110-8
LID - 10.1373/clinchem.2012.194258 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The detection and molecular characterization of circulating tumor
      cells (CTCs) are one of the most active areas of translational cancer research,
      with >400 clinical studies having included CTCs as a biomarker. The aims of
      research on CTCs include (a) estimation of the risk for metastatic relapse or
      metastatic progression (prognostic information), (b) stratification and real-time
      monitoring of therapies, (c) identification of therapeutic targets and resistance
      mechanisms, and (d) understanding metastasis development in cancer patients.
      CONTENT: This review focuses on the technologies used for the enrichment and
      detection of CTCs. We outline and discuss the current technologies that are based
      on exploiting the physical and biological properties of CTCs. A number of
      innovative technologies to improve methods for CTC detection have recently been
      developed, including CTC microchips, filtration devices, quantitative
      reverse-transcription PCR assays, and automated microscopy systems.
      Molecular-characterization studies have indicated, however, that CTCs are very
      heterogeneous, a finding that underscores the need for multiplex approaches to
      capture all of the relevant CTC subsets. We therefore emphasize the current
      challenges of increasing the yield and detection of CTCs that have undergone an
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Increasing assay analytical sensitivity may
      lead, however, to a decrease in analytical specificity (e.g., through the
      detection of circulating normal epithelial cells). SUMMARY: A considerable number
      of promising CTC-detection techniques have been developed in recent years. The
      analytical specificity and clinical utility of these methods must be demonstrated
      in large prospective multicenter studies to reach the high level of evidence
      required for their introduction into clinical practice.

TI  - Plasmonic gold and luminescent silicon nanoplatforms for multimode imaging of
      cancer cells.
PG  - 144-50
LID - 10.1039/c2ib20100c [doi]
AB  - The development of multimodal nanoparticle platforms is desirable for cancer
      nanotechnology applications. Creating single nanoplatforms with both plasmonic
      and photoluminescent optical properties has remained a challenge, because
      combining discrete entities each having one of these unique properties typically 
      results in the attenuation of one of the desirable properties. Here, we overcome 
      challenges associated with combining plasmonic gold with luminescent silicon
      nanocrystals for biological imaging applications by incorporating multiple
      silicon quantum dots into the core of a micelle and then depositing gold on the
      surface of the nanostructure. Within the newly developed nanoconstruct, the gold 
      shell exhibits plasmonic light scattering properties useful for dark field
      imaging, while the silicon nanocrystals maintain their photoluminescence. The
      result is a nanoplatform with both plasmonic and luminescent properties in a
      useful form. Multimodal imaging of pancreatic cancer cells demonstrates overlap
      of luminescence from the silicon quantum dots with light scattering from the gold
      shell. This approach can be tailored to other formulations and address the
      challenge of fluorescence attenuation that is typically observed when quantum
      dots are combined with plasmonic materials. The usefulness of these particles may
      eventually extend beyond multimodal imaging to include photothermal treatment.

TI  - integIRTy: a method to identify genes altered in cancer by accounting for
      multiple mechanisms of regulation using item response theory.
PG  - 2861-9
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/bts561 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Identifying genes altered in cancer plays a crucial role in both
      understanding the mechanism of carcinogenesis and developing novel therapeutics. 
      It is known that there are various mechanisms of regulation that can lead to gene
      dysfunction, including copy number change, methylation, abnormal expression,
      mutation and so on. Nowadays, all these types of alterations can be
      simultaneously interrogated by different types of assays. Although many methods
      have been proposed to identify altered genes from a single assay, there is no
      method that can deal with multiple assays accounting for different alteration
      types systematically. RESULTS: In this article, we propose a novel method,
      integration using item response theory (integIRTy), to identify altered genes by 
      using item response theory that allows integrated analysis of multiple
      high-throughput assays. When applied to a single assay, the proposed method is
      more robust and reliable than conventional methods such as Student's t-test or
      the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. When used to integrate multiple assays, integIRTy can
      identify novel-altered genes that cannot be found by looking at individual assay 
      separately. We applied integIRTy to three public cancer datasets (ovarian
      carcinoma, breast cancer, glioblastoma) for cross-assay type integration which
      all show encouraging results. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package
      integIRTy is available at the web site
      http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/main/OOMPA:Overview. CONTACT:
      kcoombes@mdanderson.org. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are
      available at Bioinformatics online.

TI  - Zoledronic acid effectiveness against breast cancer metastases - a role for
      estrogen in the microenvironment?
PG  - 213
LID - 10.1186/bcr3223 [doi]
AB  - Zoledronic acid (ZA) is an imidazole-containing bisphosphonate that has been
      extensively studied as an osteoclast inhibitor. ZA decreases bone turnover and
      has been effective in limiting osteolysis in metastatic cancers, including breast
      cancer. Recent clinical trials that demonstrated enhancement of disease-free
      survival by bisphosphonates have prompted interest in bisphosphonates as
      anti-cancer agents. ZA, for example, increased disease-free survival in
      postmenopausal and in premenopausal, hormone-suppressed breast cancer patients.
      Intriguingly, however, there was a lack of an anti-cancer effect of ZA in
      premenopausal women without ovarian suppression. These observations have prompted
      the conjecture that anti-cancer effects of ZA are limited to estrogen-poor
      environments. This review explores possible mechanisms compatible with
      differences in ZA activity in premenopausal women compared with postmenopausal
      (or hormone-suppressed) women.

TI  - A Phase I clinical trial of the combination of imatinib and paclitaxel in
      patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors refractory to standard therapy.
PG  - 843-53
LID - 10.1007/s00280-012-1969-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Pre-clinical data suggest that combining imatinib with traditional
      cytotoxic chemotherapy may improve imatinib efficacy. We conducted a Phase I
      study of imatinib in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors. METHODS: Patients were accrued to the study in a
      standard 3 + 3 design. Patients were restaged every two cycles, and those with
      stable disease (SD), or better, continued study treatment without interruption.
      Maximally tolerated doses (MTDs) and pharmacokinetic profiles of combination
      imatinib and paclitaxel were assessed. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients were
      enrolled, including 40 in the Phase I dose escalation portion. Alternating dose
      escalation of imatinib and paclitaxel on a 28-day cycle resulted in MTDs of 800
      mg imatinib daily, on days 1-4, 8-11, 15-18, and 22-25, and 100 mg/m(2)
      paclitaxel weekly, on days 3, 10, and 17. Two expansion cohorts, comprising 10
      breast cancer patients and 8 patients with soft-tissue sarcomas, were enrolled at
      the MTDs. The most common adverse events were flu-like symptoms (64 %) and
      nausea/vomiting (71 %). The most common Grade 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia (26
      %), flu-like symptoms (12 %), and pain (12 %). There were no relevant differences
      in the pharmacokinetic profiles of either drug when given in combination compared
      with alone. Thirty-eight subjects were evaluable for response, 18 (47.4 %) of
      whom experienced clinical benefit. Five patients (13.2 %) had a partial response 
      (PR) and 13 patients (34.2 %) had SD; the average time to progression in those
      with clinical benefit was 17 weeks (range: 7-28 weeks). CONCLUSIONS: This
      combination of imatinib and paclitaxel was reasonably safe and tolerable, and
      demonstrated evidence of anti-tumor activity. Further exploration in
      disease-specific Phase II trials is warranted.

TI  - Function of the blood-brain barrier and restriction of drug delivery to invasive 
      glioma cells: findings in an orthotopic rat xenograft model of glioma.
PG  - 33-9
LID - 10.1124/dmd.112.048322 [doi]
AB  - Despite aggressive treatment with radiation and chemotherapy, recurrence of
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is inevitable. The objective of this study was to
      show that the blood-brain barrier (BBB), through a combination of tight junctions
      and active efflux transporters in the brain microvasculature, can significantly
      restrict delivery of molecularly targeted agents to invasive glioma cells.
      Transgenic mice lacking P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance
      protein (Bcrp) were used to study efflux of erlotinib at the BBB. A U87 rat
      xenograft model of GBM was used to investigate the regional distribution of
      erlotinib to the tumor, and brain regions surrounding the tumor. The effect of
      concurrent administration of elacridar on regional tumor distribution of
      erlotinib was evaluated. We show that erlotinib transport across an intact BBB is
      significantly restricted due to P-gp- and Bcrp-mediated efflux transport. We then
      show that the BBB is sufficiently intact in areas of brain adjacent to the tumor 
      core to significantly restrict erlotinib delivery. Inhibition of P-gp and Bcrp by
      the dual inhibitor elacridar dramatically increased erlotinib delivery to the
      tumor core, rim, and normal brain. These results provide conclusive evidence of
      the impact that active efflux at the BBB has on the delivery of molecularly
      targeted therapy to different tumor regions in glioma. These data also support
      the possibility that the repeated failure of clinical trials of new drugs for
      gliomas may be in part due to a failure to achieve effective concentrations in
      invasive tumor cells that reside behind an intact BBB.

PG  - 1185-96
LID - 10.1039/c2mt20070h [doi]
AB  - An approach to characterize the interactions of RAPTA-T, a novel ruthenium-based 
      anticancer drug candidate with intriguing antimetastatic properties, with human
      ovarian cancer cells in vitro is described. The distribution profile of the
      metallodrug within the cancer cells was determined by (size exclusion
      chromatography)-inductively coupled mass spectrometry combined with subcellular
      fractionation procedures (metallomics). Multidimensional protein identification
      technology (MudPIT) was then used to obtain insight into the alteration of the
      cellular proteome upon RAPTA-T treatment. The metallomics approach reveals
      striking differences in the intracellular behavior of the drug between
      cisplatin-sensitive and resistant cell lines and provides clues on possible
      mechanisms of action as well as detoxification, quantitative proteomics based on 
      spectral counting sheds light on cellular response mechanisms to metallodrug
      treatment.

TI  - Visualizing clinical predictors of febrile neutropenia in Asian cancer patients
      receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy.
PG  - 111-20
LID - 10.1177/1078155212457806 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Febrile neutropenia is a serious complication among cancer patients
      receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Patient-specific risk factors,
      chemotherapy-related and disease-related characteristics can affect the clinical 
      outcome and management of febrile neutropenia. Although many factors have been
      identified, they vary among different patient populations. We identified
      clinically-relevant febrile neutropenia predictors in Asian cancer patients
      through visualization of these factors. METHODS: A single-centered, retrospective
      study was conducted from May to July 2011 at a local cancer center. Demographics 
      and risk factor data were collated from electronic health records and four cancer
      registries. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Additionally,
      potential febrile neutropenia predictors were identified using categorical
      principal component and multiple correspondence analyses. RESULTS: A total of 583
      patients were analyzed. Majority was females (79%), Chinese (75%) and diagnosed
      with breast cancers (60%). Six risk factors were identified as potential
      predictors: types of cancer (16.9-19.8% of variance), chemotherapy regimen
      (anthracycline-based 11.8-12.9%, taxane-based 8.1%), liver function tests
      (alanine transaminase 8.6%, alkaline phosphatase 4.0%), renal function tests
      (serum creatinine 3.1%), prior granulocyte colony stimulating factor use (5.6%)
      and diabetes mellitus (6.6-6.9%). In terms of cancer types, lymphomas were more
      predictive than breast cancers. CONCLUSION: From our knowledge, this is the first
      study that has identified clinically-relevant febrile neutropenia predictors in
      Asian cancer patients through visualization of their risk factors. The use of
      these predictors to identify patients at risk for adverse reactions, such as FN, 
      can allow clinicians to optimize prophylactic granulocyte colony stimulating
      factor usage in these patients.

TI  - Catalysts to withdrawal from familial ovarian cancer screening for surgery and
      reactions to discontinued screening: a qualitative study.
PG  - 19-26
LID - 10.1007/s10689-012-9567-x [doi]
AB  - Women at high risk of familial ovarian cancer face a potentially difficult risk
      management choice between unproven ovarian cancer screening (OCS) and bilateral
      salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). It is not fully understood why women who initially
      opt for OCS may later undergo BSO, nor what the impact of this may be. This study
      explored the catalysts for surgery and reactions to discontinuing OCS.
      Semi-structured interviews were completed with 21 women who had undergone surgery
      having initially chosen OCS to explore their screening experiences, reasons for
      and feelings about surgery, and reactions to discontinuing OCS. The invasive
      nature and frequency of OCS were not by themselves a catalyst for surgery. A
      number of catalysts, including abnormal OCS test results, and secondary
      considerations, such as age-related factors, were found to prompt surgery. The
      emotional impact of discontinuing OCS following BSO varied between relief,
      acceptance, and loss of reassurance. OCS appears to be an acceptable risk
      management strategy under certain circumstances, but varying factors can prompt
      the decision to opt instead for BSO. The complexity of this management change
      decision should not be underestimated and needs to be taken into account by
      clinicians assisting women making choices. These findings highlight the
      importance of the timing of decision-making about BSO and that risk management
      options need routine reconsideration, through clinical discussions, information
      and support.

TI  - Validation of the lung cancer staging system revisions using a large prospective 
      clinical trial database (ACOSOG Z0030).
PG  - 911-4
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezs520 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A new revision of the international lung cancer staging system has
      been recently introduced. The revisions are largely focussed on the T descriptor.
      We sought to test the validity of this new system on a separate prospectively
      collected cohort of patients from a recent multicentre trial of early-stage lung 
      cancer. METHODS: We reviewed the prospectively collected data from 1012 patients 
      undergoing pulmonary resection for early-stage lung cancer in the ACOSOG Z0030
      trial. TNM descriptors and overall staging were assessed using both the sixth and
      seventh editions of the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the Union
      Internationale Contre le Cancer (AJCC/UICC) lung cancer staging system. Survival 
      results were analysed according to both staging allocations. RESULTS: Using the
      proposed criteria, the number of patients by stage in the sixth and seventh
      edition allocations, respectively, were as follows: IA (432, 431); IB (402, 303);
      IIA (39, 167); IIB (94, 70); IIIA (26, 40); IIIB (19,0); there were no stage IV
      patients by either version. Overall, 180 (18%) patients had a change in the stage
      group from the sixth to seventh edition versions with 76 (8%) being downstaged
      and 104 (10%) being upstaged. In the sixth edition staging system based on
      pathological stages, median survivals in years were as follows: IA, NA; IB, 7.7; 
      IIA, 4.0; IIB, 3.6; IIIA, 2.6 and IIIB, 2.4. Five-year survivals were: IA, 76.4%;
      IB, 62.0%; IIA, 47.8%; IIB, 40.4%; IIIA, 31.3% and IIIB, 44.4%. In the new
      system, median survivals in years were as follows: IA, NA; IB, 8.2; IIA, 4.4;
      IIB, 3.6 and IIIA, 1.8. Five-year survivals were: IA, 76.9%; IB, 65.0%; IIA,
      48.5%; IIB, 42.9% and IIIA, 30.6%. Survival analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival
      curves showed more monotonic progression, distinction and homogeneity within
      groups in the seventh edition. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an external
      validation of the recently revised lung cancer staging system using a large
      multicentre database. The seventh edition of the AJCC/UICC lung cancer staging
      system appears to be an improvement over the preceding system.

TI  - Risk factors for anastomotic leakage following anterior resection for colorectal 
      cancer: the effect of epidural analgesia on occurrence.
PG  - 485-92
LID - 10.1007/s00384-012-1585-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The effect of thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) on anastomotic leakage
      (AL) after anterior resection for colorectal cancer is controversial. The aim of 
      this study was to evaluate the risk factors including TEA for the occurrence of
      AL after anterior resection for colorectal cancer. METHODS: This retrospective
      study included 1,312 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent anterior
      resection between 2000 and 2011 at the Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University.
      Univariate and multivariate logistics analyses were performed to determine the
      risk factors, including TEA, for AL. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of TEA
      on outcome parameters. RESULTS: AL occurred in 118 (9 %) of the 1,312 patients.
      In univariate analysis, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score,
      history of hypertension, episodes of hypotension, anastomosis technique, tumor
      localization, anesthesia duration, and perioperative blood transfusion were
      significant risk factors for AL. Multivariate analysis showed that ASA (P =
      0.001), perioperative blood transfusion (P < 0.001), anastomosis technique (P =
      0.019), anesthesia duration (P = 0.033), and tumor localization (P = 0.009) were 
      independent factors affecting AL. TEA had no effect on the occurrence of AL (P = 
      0.451) in multivariate analysis. However, the length of hospital stay was
      shortened by the use of TEA (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this
      retrospective study suggest that TEA has no effect on the occurrence of AL.
      However, TEA may be recommended to shorten the length of hospital stay.

TI  - Do tumor grade and location affect survival in esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma? Survival analysis of 302 cases of pT3N0M0 esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma.
PG  - 580-5
LID - 10.1245/s10434-012-2656-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)
      cancer staging manual incorporates tumor grade and location for staging pT2-3N0M0
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Patients with pT3N0M0, classified as stage
      IIa according to the 6th edition of the AJCC cancer staging manual, can now be
      classified as stage Ib, IIa, or IIb. We aimed to discuss whether these changes
      affect survival and determine other potential prognostic factors. METHODS: We
      retrospectively analyzed 302 patients with postoperative pathologic stage T3N0M0 
      who underwent esophagectomy between 1990 and 2005 at Sun Yat-sen University
      Cancer Center. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses to identify
      prognostic factors for survival and used the Kaplan-Meier method to compare
      survival difference in each prognostic factor, including tumor grade and
      location. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate was 46 %, with a median
      survival of 1,244.5 days. Gender, age, alcohol consumption, forced expiratory
      volume in 1 s (FEV1), and number of removed lymph nodes were independent
      prognostic factors in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Smoking was also
      a prognostic factor in survival analysis by the Kaplan-Meier method. However,
      histologic tumor grade and location had no significant influence on patient
      survival. CONCLUSIONS: Age, gender, alcohol consumption, FEV1, number of removed 
      lymph nodes, and cigarette smoking are independent prognostic factors in patients
      with pT3N0M0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, tumor grade and
      location may not be as strong predictors in these patients as indicated in the
      7th edition of the AJCC cancer staging manual.

TI  - KRAS p.G13D mutations are associated with sensitivity to anti-EGFR antibody
      treatment in colorectal cancer cell lines.
PG  - 201-9
LID - 10.1007/s00432-012-1319-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Targeted therapies using the anti-EGFR antibodies panitumumab (Pmab) or 
      cetuximab (Cmab) are currently restricted to patients with metastatic colorectal 
      adenocarcinoma whose tumours do not show a mutation in KRAS. However, recent
      retrospective studies indicated that patients with tumours mutated in codon 13 of
      KRAS may benefit from treatment with Cmab in contrast to patients with tumours
      mutated in KRAS codon 12. METHODS: To study the functional impact of the subtype 
      of KRAS mutations on the efficiency of EGFR-targeted therapies, we correlated the
      KRAS mutation status of 15 colorectal carcinoma cell lines with the in vitro
      sensitivity of these cells to Cmab/Pmab. Mutations in the potential predictive
      biomarkers BRAF and PIK3CA as well as protein expression of EGFR and PTEN were
      also determined. RESULTS: Four out of seven KRAS-mutated cell lines were
      characterised by the p.G13D mutation. Treatment of these cells using Cmab/Pmab
      induced a significant growth inhibition in contrast to cell lines showing a KRAS 
      mutation at codon 12 or 61. Out of the eight KRAS wild-type cell lines, five were
      insensitive to Cmab/Pmab. These cell lines were characterised either by BRAF
      mutation or by absence of EGFR or PTEN protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: Since
      KRAS p.G13D-mutated tumour cells may respond to EGFR-targeted therapy, we suggest
      including subtype analysis of KRAS mutations in prospective clinical trials. In
      KRAS wild-type tumour cells, BRAF mutations and loss of EGFR or PTEN expression
      may lead to resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy and should be considered as
      additional negative predictive biomarkers.

LID - 10.1684/bdc.2012.1647 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe delays in diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer in
      patients treated by radiotherapy from the first abnormal imaging to the first day
      of treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our retrospective single-center study
      included all patients treated for primary lung cancer in our center receiving
      radiotherapy alone or in association to chemotherapy or surgery, between 1st May 
      and 15th September 2011. RESULTS: We included 40 patients. Mean age was 65.3
      years and sex ratio was 4 (32 males). In 72.5% (n = 29) of the cases, the
      objective of the treatment was palliative. Median delay between the first
      abnormal imaging to the first day of treatment was 75.5 days (CI 95%
      [63.6-134.4]). Median diagnostic delay to obtain a pathological proof was 38 days
      (CI 95% [27.9-100]). Median therapeutic delay to start treatment was 31 days (CI 
      95% [24.6-38.5]). When considering radiotherapy, median delay between
      multidisciplinary staff decision and first radiotherapy session was 26 days (CI
      95% [22.4-33.3]). CONCLUSION: The study of the delays in diagnosis and treatment 
      is the first step to reduce them. Detailed analysis helps to propose some
      measures to improve these delays.

TI  - Increased COMT expression in pancreatic cancer and correlation with
      clinicopathologic parameters.
PG  - 747-52
AB  - Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) is an enzyme involved in estrogen
      metabolism. Proteomic and immunoproteomic screens suggested COMT might be an
      immunogenic membrane antigen in human pancreatic cancer. The aim of this study
      was to investigate the dynamic expression of COMT in pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and noncancerous pancreatic tissue, and to determine the
      relationship between COMT expression and clinicopathologic parameters. COMT
      expression was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
      (RT-PCR) and western blot in five pancreatic cell lines and five pairs of PDAC
      and noncancerous pancreatic tissue. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate
      COMT expression in tissue microarrays and 20 cases of paraffin-embedded clinical 
      specimens. The results indicated that COMT expression was detected in AsPC-1,
      BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2, Capan-1 and SW1990 pancreatic cell lines, and in five pairs
      of PDAC and noncancerous pancreatic tissue, at the mRNA and protein levels.
      Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that COMT expression was significantly
      higher in PDAC than in nonmalignant pancreatic tissue. High expression of COMT
      significantly correlated to early T stages. Therefore, we conclude that COMT
      might serve as a potential biomarker for applied clinical pathology in PDAC.

TI  - Ion channels/transporters as epigenetic regulators? -a microRNA perspective.
PG  - 753-60
AB  - MicroRNA (miRNA) alterations in response to changes in an extracellular
      microenvironment have been observed and considered as one of the major mechanisms
      for epigenetic modifications of the cell. While enormous efforts have been made
      in the understanding of the role of miRNAs in regulating cellular responses to
      the microenvironment, the mechanistic insight into how extracellular signals can 
      be transduced into miRNA alterations in cells is still lacking. Interestingly,
      recent studies have shown that ion channels/transporters, which are known to
      conduct or transport ions across the cell membrane, also exhibit changes in
      levels of expression and activities in response to changes of extracellular
      microenvironment. More importantly, alterations in expression and function of ion
      channels/transporters have been shown to result in changes in miRNAs that are
      known to change in response to alteration of the microenvironment. In this
      review, we aim to summarize the recent data demonstrating the ability of ion
      channels/transporters to transduce extracellular signals into miRNA changes and
      propose a potential link between cells and their microenvironment through ion
      channels/transporters. At the same time, we hope to provide new insights into
      epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying a number of physiological and
      pathological processes, including embryo development and cancer metastasis.

TI  - Targeted imaging of breast tumor progression and therapeutic response in a human 
      uMUC-1 expressing transgenic mouse model.
PG  - 1860-7
LID - 10.1002/ijc.27872 [doi]
AB  - The ability to monitor breast cancer initiation and progression on the molecular 
      level would provide an effective tool for early diagnosis and therapy. In the
      present study, we focused on the underglycosylated MUC-1 tumor antigen (uMUC-1), 
      which is directly linked to tumor progression from pre-malignancy to advanced
      malignancy in breast cancer and has been identified as the independent predictor 
      of local recurrence and tumor response to chemotherapy. We investigated whether
      changes in uMUC-1 expression during tumor development and therapeutic
      intervention could be monitored non-invasively using molecular imaging approach
      with the uMUC-1-specific contrast agent (MN-EPPT) detectable by magnetic
      resonance and fluorescence optical imaging. This was done in mice that express
      human uMUC-1 tumor antigen (MMT mice) and develop spontaneous mammary carcinoma
      in a stage-wise fashion. After the injection of MN-EPPT there was a significant
      reduction in average T2 relaxation times of the mammary fat pad between
      pre-malignancy and cancer. In addition, T2 relaxation times were already altered 
      at pre-malignant state in these mice compared to non-tumor bearing mice. This
      indicated that targeting uMUC-1 could be useful for detecting pre-malignant
      transformation in the mammary fat pad. We also probed changes in uMUC-1
      expression with MN-EPPT during therapy with doxorubicin (Dox). We observed that
      tumor delta-T2s were significantly reduced by treatment with Dox indicating lower
      accumulation of MN-EPPT. This correlated with a lower level of MUC-1 expression
      in the Dox-treated tumors, as confirmed by immunoblotting. Our study could
      provide a very sensitive molecular imaging approach for monitoring tumor
      progression and therapeutic response.

TI  - Preoperative assessment of tumor location and station-specific lymph node status 
      in patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction.
PG  - 147-55
LID - 10.1007/s00268-012-1804-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In esophageal cancer patients preoperative staging will determine the
      type of surgical procedure and use of neoadjuvant therapy. Tumor location and
      lymph node status play a pivotal role in this tailored strategy. The aim of the
      present study was to prospectively evaluate the accuracy of preoperative
      assessment of tumor location according to the Siewert classification and lymph
      node status per station with endoscopy/endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and computed
      tomography (CT). METHODS: In 50 esophagectomy patients with adenocarcinoma of the
      gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), tumor location according to Siewert and N-stage 
      per nodal station as determined preoperatively by endoscopy/EUS and CT were
      compared with the histopathologic findings in the resection specimen. RESULTS:
      Overall accuracy in predicting tumor location according to the Siewert
      classification was 70 % for endoscopy/EUS and 72 % for CT. Preoperative data
      could not be compared with the pathologic assessment in 11 patients (22 %), as
      large tumors obscured the landmark of the gastric folds. The overall accuracy for
      predicting the N-stage in 250 lymph node stations was 66 % for EUS and 68 % for
      CT. The accuracy was good for those stations located high in the thorax, but poor
      for celiac trunk nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Given the frequent discrepancy between the
      endoscopic and pathologic location of the GEJ and the common problem of advanced 
      tumors obscuring the landmarks used in the assessment of the Siewert
      classification, its usefulness is limited. The overall accuracy for EUS and CT in
      predicting the N-stage per station was moderate.

TI  - Elevated nuclear expression of the SMRT corepressor in breast cancer is
      associated with earlier tumor recurrence.
PG  - 253-65
LID - 10.1007/s10549-012-2262-7 [doi]
AB  - Silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT), also
      known as nuclear corepressor 2 (NCOR2) is a transcriptional corepressor for
      multiple members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors,
      including estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha). In the classical model of
      corepressor action, SMRT binds to antiestrogen-bound ERalpha at target promoters 
      and represses ERalpha transcriptional activity and gene expression. Herein SMRT
      mRNA and protein expression was examined in a panel of 30 breast cancer cell
      lines. Expression of both parameters was found to vary considerably amongst lines
      and the correlation between protein and mRNA expression was very poor (R (2) =
      0.0775). Therefore, SMRT protein levels were examined by immunohistochemical
      staining of a tissue microarray of 866 patients with stage I-II breast cancer.
      Nuclear and cytoplasmic SMRT were scored separately according to the Allred
      score. The majority of tumors (67 %) were negative for cytoplasmic SMRT, which
      when detected was found at very low levels. In contrast, nuclear SMRT was broadly
      detected. There was no significant difference in time to recurrence (TTR)
      according to SMRT expression levels in the ERalpha-positive tamoxifen-treated
      patients (P = 0.297) but the difference was significant in the untreated patients
      (P = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, ERalpha-positive tamoxifen-untreated
      patients with high nuclear SMRT expression (SMRT 5-8, i.e., 2nd to 4th quartile) 
      had a shorter TTR (HR = 1.94, 95 % CI, 1.24-3.04; P = 0.004) while there was no
      association with SMRT expression for ERalpha-positive tamoxifen-treated patients.
      There was no association between SMRT expression and overall survival for
      patients, regardless of whether they received tamoxifen. Thus while SMRT protein 
      expression was not predictive of outcome after antiestrogen therapy, it may have 
      value in predicting tumor recurrence in patients not receiving adjuvant tamoxifen
      therapy.

TI  - Feasibility, safety and pharmacokinetic study of hepatic administration of
      drug-eluting beads loaded with irinotecan (DEBIRI) followed by intravenous
      administration of irinotecan in a porcine model.
PG  - 115-27
LID - 10.1007/s10856-012-4768-2 [doi]
AB  - Irinotecan eluting embolization beads (DEBIRI) are currently being evaluated in
      the clinic for the treatment of colorectal cancer metastases to the liver. The
      aim of this study was to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics associated
      with two cycles of hepatic embolization using DEBIRI followed by intravenous
      administration of irinotecan. Pigs were embolized with DEBIRI (100-300 mum, 100
      mg dose, n = 6) and blood samples taken over 24 h to determine plasma levels of
      irinotecan and SN-38 metabolite and for haematology and biochemistry. At 24 h an 
      IV infusion of 250 mg/m(2) of irinotecan was administered and the plasma levels
      taken again. This cycle was repeated 3 weeks later. A single animal was subjected
      to a more aggressive regimen of embolization with 200 mg bead dose and IV of 350 
      mg/m(2) for two cycles. Three animals were sacrificed at 6 weeks and the
      remaining four (n = 3 standard dose, n = 1 high dose) animals at 12 weeks and
      detailed histopathology performed. All animals tolerated the treatments well,
      with only minor changes in haematological and biochemical parameters. There was
      no overlap in drug plasma levels observed from the bead and IV treatments when
      given 24 h apart and no difference between the pharmacokinetic profiles of the
      two cycles separated by 3 weeks. Irinotecan plasma AUC values were similar in
      both the embolization and IV arms of the study. C(max) values obtained during the
      IV arms of the study are approximately double that of the embolization arms
      whilst T(max) times are shorter in the IV arms, supporting extended release of
      drug from the beads. Bioavailability for bead-based delivery was double that for 
      IV administration, which was attributed to reduced clearance of the drug when
      delivered by this route. No additive toxicity was observed as a consequence of
      the combined treatments. The combination of irinotecan delivery via drug eluting 
      bead and IV was well-tolerated with no significant clinical effects.
      Pharmacokinetic analyses suggest the bioavailability from bead-based delivery of 
      drug is double that of IV infusion, attributable to reduced drug clearance for
      the former.

TI  - CD43 in the nucleus and cytoplasm of lung cancer is a potential therapeutic
      target.
PG  - 1761-70
LID - 10.1002/ijc.27873 [doi]
AB  - CD43 is a transmembrane sialoglycoprotein. Normally the molecule is only produced
      by white blood cells where it regulates functions such as intercellular adhesion,
      intracellular signaling, apoptosis, migration and proliferation. Two CD43
      antibodies were used to interrogate 66 cases of non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) and 24 cases of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In addition, we engineered
      the CD43-positive lung cancer cell line A549 to stably express either
      non-targeted or CD43-targeted small-interfering RNA (siRNA). These lines were
      then subjected to in vitro assays of apoptosis, natural killer (NK) cell
      cytotoxicity, intercellular adhesion and transendothelial migration. A xenograft 
      mouse model evaluated the ability of the lines to grow primary tumors in vivo.
      CD43 was found to be expressed in the majority of both SCLC and NSCLC. Inclusive 
      of CD43-negative tumors, differential patterns of nuclear and cytoplasmic
      expression of CD43 define four molecular subcategories of lung cancer. Targeting 
      CD43 in A549 lung cancer cells, increased homotypic adhesion, decreased
      heterotypic adhesion and transendothelial migration, increased susceptibility to 
      apoptosis and increased vulnerability to lysis by NK cells. Furthermore,
      targeting inhibited the growth of primary tumors in nude mice.

TI  - Obesity and survival in population-based patients with pancreatic cancer in the
      San Francisco Bay Area.
PG  - 1929-37
LID - 10.1007/s10552-012-0070-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity has been consistently associated with increased risk of
      pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality. However, studies of obesity and
      overall survival in patients with pancreatic cancer are notably lacking,
      especially in population-based studies. METHODS: Active and passive follow-up
      were used to determine vital status and survival for 510 pancreatic cancer
      patients diagnosed from 1995 to 1999 in a large population-based case-control
      study in the San Francisco Bay Area. Survival rates were computed using
      Kaplan-Meier methods. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were 
      estimated in multivariable Cox proportional hazards models as measures of the
      association between pre-diagnostic obesity and pancreatic cancer survival.
      RESULTS: An elevated hazard ratio of 1.3 (95 % CI, 0.91-1.81) was observed for
      obese [body mass index (BMI) >/= 30] compared with normal range BMI (<25)
      patients. Associations between BMI and overall survival did not statistically
      significantly vary by known prognostic and risk factors (all p-interaction
      >/=0.18), yet elevated HRs consistently were observed for obese compared with
      normal BMI patients [localized disease at diagnosis (HR, 3.1), surgical resection
      (HR, 1.6), ever smokers (HR, 1.6), diabetics (HR, 3.3)]. Poor survival was
      observed among men, older patients, more recent and current smokers, whereas
      improved survival was observed for Asian/Pacific Islanders. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      results in general provide limited support for an association between
      pre-diagnostic obesity and decreased survival in patients with pancreatic cancer.
      Patterns of reduced survival associated with obesity in some patient subgroups
      could be due to chance and require assessment in larger pooled studies.

AB  - Regio- and stereoselective installation of boryl and stannyl moieties into a
      carbon-carbon triple bond of various alkynes has been achieved based on a
      three-component coupling reaction by using a diboron and a tin alkoxide with the 
      aid of a copper(II) acetate-tricyclohexylphosphine complex, giving diverse
      vic-borylstannylalkenes in a straightforward manner. Carbon-tin and carbon-boron 
      bonds of the resulting borylstannylation product are successively transformed
      into carbon-carbon bonds by a Migita-Kosugi-Stille and a Suzuki-Miyaura coupling,
      leading to the formation of (Z)-tamoxifen with anti-breast cancer activity.

TI  - Whole exome sequencing of pediatric gastric adenocarcinoma reveals an atypical
      presentation of Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
PG  - 570-4
LID - 10.1002/pbc.24316 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastric adenocarcinoma is a rare diagnosis in childhood. A
      14-year-old male patient presented with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, and a 
      strong family history of colon cancer. Clinical sequencing of CDH1 and APC were
      negative. Whole exome sequencing was therefore applied to capture the majority of
      protein-coding regions for the identification of single-nucleotide variants,
      small insertion/deletions, and copy number abnormalities in the patient's
      germline as well as primary tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from 
      the patient's blood, primary tumor, and the unaffected mother's blood. DNA
      libraries were constructed and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000. Data were
      post-processed using Picard and Samtools, then analyzed with the Genome Analysis 
      Toolkit. Variants were annotated using an in-house Ensembl-based program. Copy
      number was assessed using ExomeCNV. RESULTS: Each sample was sequenced to a mean 
      depth of coverage of greater than 120x. A rare non-synonymous coding
      single-nucleotide variant (SNV) in TP53 was identified in the germline. There
      were 10 somatic cancer protein-damaging variants that were not observed in the
      unaffected mother genome. ExomeCNV comparing tumor to the patient's germline,
      identified abnormal copy number, spanning 6,946 genes. CONCLUSION: We present an 
      unusual case of Li-Fraumeni detected by whole exome sequencing. There were also
      likely driver somatic mutations in the gastric adenocarcinoma. These results
      highlight the need for more thorough and broad scale germline and cancer analyses
      to accurately inform patients of inherited risk to cancer and to identify somatic
      mutations.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of postoperative use of non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on anastomotic leakage requiring reoperation
      after colorectal resection. DESIGN: Cohort study based on data from a prospective
      clinical database and electronically registered medical records. SETTING: Six
      major colorectal centres in eastern Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: 2766 patients (1441
      (52%) men) undergoing elective operation for colorectal cancer with colonic or
      rectal resection and primary anastomosis between 1 January 2006 and 31 December
      2009. Median age was 70 years (interquartile range 62-77). INTERVENTION:
      Postoperative use of NSAID (defined as at least two days of NSAID treatment in
      the first seven days after surgery). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of clinical
      anastomotic leakage verified at reoperation; mortality at 30 days. RESULTS: Of
      2756 patients with available data and included in the final analysis, 1871 (68%) 
      did not receive postoperative NSAID treatment (controls) and 885 (32%) did. In
      the NSAID group, 655 (74%) patients received ibuprofen and 226 (26%) received
      diclofenac. Anastomotic leakage verified at reoperation was significantly
      increased among patients receiving diclofenac and ibuprofen treatment, compared
      with controls (12.8% and 8.2% v 5.1%; P<0.001). After unadjusted analyses and
      when compared with controls, more patients had anastomotic leakage after
      treatment with diclofenac (7.8% (95% confidence interval 3.9% to 12.8%)) and
      ibuprofen (3.2% (1.0% to 5.7%)). But after multivariate logistic regression
      analysis, only diclofenac treatment was a risk factor for leakage (odds ratio 7.2
      (95% confidence interval 3.8 to 13.4), P<0.001; ibuprofen 1.5 (0.8 to 2.9),
      P=0.18). Other risk factors for anastomotic leakage were male sex, rectal (v
      colonic) anastomosis, and blood transfusion. 30 day mortality was comparable in
      the three groups (diclofenac 1.8% v ibuprofen 4.1% v controls 3.2%; P=0.20).
      CONCLUSIONS: Diclofenac treatment could result in an increased proportion of
      patients with anastomotic leakage after colorectal surgery. Cyclo-oxygenase-2
      selective NSAIDs should be used with caution after colorectal resections with
      primary anastomosis. Large scale, randomised controlled trials are urgently
      needed.

TI  - Overexpression of galectin-3 enhances migration of colon cancer cells related to 
      activation of the K-Ras-Raf-Erk1/2 pathway.
PG  - 350-9
LID - 10.1007/s00535-012-0663-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Galectin-3 has been independently correlated with malignant behavior 
      in human colon cancer. The involvement of galectin-3 in the invasiveness of colon
      cancer cells remains to be determined. We investigated whether galectin-3 was
      involved in the colon cancer cell migration mediated by certain kinase pathways. 
      METHODS: We studied 2 colon cancer cell lines (DLD-1 and Caco2) and clinical
      samples. Immunostaining and Western blotting were used to analyze the expression 
      of galectin-3 in vitro and in the clinical samples. Short hairpin RNA and
      overexpression of galectin-3 were used to study loss- and gain-of-function in a
      wound-healing assay and a Transwell migration assay, and Western blotting was
      used to study the Ras-Raf signaling pathway. RESULTS: Galectin-3 was expressed at
      lower levels in DLD-1 than in Caco2 cells. The lower galectin-3 level in DLD-1
      cells was associated with decreased cell migration, in comparison with that of
      Caco2 cells. Overexpression of galectin-3 increased the migration rate of DLD-1, 
      while knockdown of galectin-3 decreased the migration. Overexpression of
      galectin-3 was correlated with increased lamellipodia formation and distal lung
      localization in a mouse model. The galectin-3 enhancement of DLD-1 cell migration
      was mediated by K-Ras, Raf and Erk1/2 pathway activation, but not the H-Ras, p38,
      or JNK activation. CONCLUSIONS: Galectin-3 plays an important role in regulating 
      colon cancer cell migration and potential distal localization. The galectin-3
      enhancement of cell migration is mediated through the K-Ras-Raf-Erk1/2 pathway.
      Specific targeting of the K-Ras-Raf-Erk1/2 pathway may be useful for treating
      colon cancers associated with increased galectin-3 expression.

AB  - The association between polymorphism of human papillomavirus type 52 (HPV52) and 
      high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2,3) was investigated in
      Canadian women. HPV-52-positive endocervical specimens collected from 216 women
      selected from a total of 3,614 participants recruited in two case-control and two
      cohort studies conducted in Canada, were further analyzed by PCR-sequencing of
      the LCR and E6 gene. Overall, the HPV52 LCR prototype was detected more
      frequently in Caucasian women (69 of 132, 52.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI):
      43.8%-60.6%) than in non-Caucasian women (15 of 48, 31.3%, 95% CI 19.9%-45.4%).
      In two cohort studies, HPV52 prototype was detected in seven of 15 (46.7%, 95% CI
      24.8-69.9) HPV52 persistent infections and 14 of 35 (40.0%, 95% CI 25.5-56.5)
      transient infections (p = 0.76). In two case-control studies, 30 participants did
      not have CIN, 18 had low-grade CIN (CIN1), 64 had CIN2,3, seven had cervical
      cancer and the diagnosis was undefined for 27 women. Variant MTL-52-LCR-02 was
      detected more frequently in women with cancer (28.6%, 95% CI 7.6%-64.8%) than in 
      women without cancer or CIN2,3 (0%, 95% CI 0.0%-9.2%; p = 0.015). CIN2,3 risk was
      significantly associated with a deletion at nucleotide position 7695 in the LCR
      (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.2-20.8), the T7744C variation in the LCR (OR 5.7, 95% CI
      1.1-32.0), and the K93R variation in E6 (OR 6.9, 95% CI 1.3-36.8), after
      adjusting for age, detection of HPV16 or 18 and study site. These findings
      indicate that HPV52 polymorphism influences risk of CIN-2,3 and possibly invasive
      cancer.

TI  - Overexpression of LSD1 in hepatocellular carcinoma: a latent target for the
      diagnosis and therapy of hepatoma.
PG  - 173-80
LID - 10.1007/s13277-012-0525-x [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of LSD1 in human
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and HCC samples. In this study, we
      examined LSD1 expression in 60 paired liver cancer tissues and adjacent
      noncancerous tissues by Western blot. In addition, we analyzed LSD1 expression in
      198 HCC samples by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between LSD1 expression
      and clinicopathological features was investigated. The HCC cell line SMMC-7721
      was transfected with LSD1 siRNA expressing plasmids. We subsequently examined in 
      vitro cell growth using the MTT assay and anchorage-independent growth through a 
      soft-agar colony-formation assay. In addition, the expression levels of Bcl-2 and
      c-Myc were also examined. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting consistently 
      confirmed LSD1 overexpression in HCC tissues compared with adjacent
      non-neoplastic tissues (P < 0.01). Additionally, immunostaining showed more
      LSD1-positive cells in the higher tumor stage (T3-4) and tumor grade (G3) than in
      the lower tumor stage (T1-2, P < 0.001) and tumor grade (G1-2, P < 0.001).
      Knockdown of LSD1 expression in HCC cells led to decreased cell proliferation.
      The expression of Bcl-2 and c-Myc were down-regulated after transfection of LSD1 
      siRNA into HCC cell line SMMC-7721. In conclusion, because LSD1 was overexpressed
      in HCC and has an important role in the development of HCC, LSD1 could be a
      latent target in the diagnosis and therapy of HCC.

TI  - Menstrual and reproductive factors in women, genetic variation in CYP17A1, and
      pancreatic cancer risk in the European prospective investigation into cancer and 
      nutrition (EPIC) cohort.
PG  - 2164-75
LID - 10.1002/ijc.27875 [doi]
AB  - Menstrual and reproductive factors and exogenous hormone use have been
      investigated as pancreatic cancer risk factors in case-control and cohort
      studies, but results have been inconsistent. We conducted a prospective
      examination of menstrual and reproductive factors, exogenous hormone use and
      pancreatic cancer risk (based on 304 cases) in 328,610 women from the EPIC
      cohort. Then, in a case-control study nested within the EPIC cohort, we examined 
      12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP17A1 (an essential gene in sex
      steroid metabolism) for association with pancreatic cancer in women and men (324 
      cases and 353 controls). Of all factors analyzed, only younger age at menarche
      (<12 vs. 13 years) was moderately associated with an increased risk of pancreatic
      cancer in the full cohort; however, this result was marginally significant (HR = 
      1.44; 95% CI = 0.99-2.10). CYP17A1 rs619824 was associated with HRT use (p value 
      = 0.037) in control women; however, none of the SNPs alone, in combination, or as
      haplotypes were associated with pancreatic cancer risk. In conclusion, with the
      possible exception of an early age of menarche, none of the menstrual and
      reproductive factors, and none of the 12 common genetic variants we evaluated at 
      the CYP17A1 locus makes a substantial contribution to pancreatic cancer
      susceptibility in the EPIC cohort.

TI  - Use of Joint Commission International standards to evaluate and improve pediatric
      oncology nursing care in Guatemala.
PG  - 810-5
LID - 10.1002/pbc.24318 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inadequate nursing care is a major impediment to development of
      effective programs for treatment of childhood cancer in low-income countries.
      When the International Outreach Program at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital 
      established partner sites in low-income countries, few nurses had pediatric
      oncology skills or experience. A comprehensive nursing program was developed to
      promote the provision of quality nursing care, and in this manuscript we describe
      the program's impact on 20 selected Joint Commission International (JCI) quality 
      standards at the National Pediatric Oncology Unit in Guatemala. We utilized JCI
      standards to focus the nursing evaluation and implementation of improvements.
      These standards were developed to assess public hospitals in low-income countries
      and are recognized as the gold standard of international quality evaluation.
      METHODS: We compared the number of JCI standards met before and after the nursing
      program was implemented using direct observation of nursing care; review of
      medical records, policies, procedures, and job descriptions; and interviews with 
      staff. RESULTS: In 2006, only 1 of the 20 standards was met fully, 2 partially,
      and 17 not met. In 2009, 16 were met fully, 1 partially, and 3 not met. Several
      factors contributed to the improvement. The pre-program quality evaluation
      provided objective and credible findings and an organizational framework for
      implementing change. The medical, administrative, and nursing staff worked
      together to improve nursing standards. CONCLUSION: A systematic approach and
      involvement of all hospital disciplines led to significant improvement in nursing
      care that was reflected by fully meeting 16 of 20 standards.

      distant metastasis. In the present study, we further demonstrated that forced
      NCAM-140 isoform expression in human thyroid cancer cells could lead to
      aggressive growth by enhancing migration and anchorage-independent growth, and
      exhibiting partial features of epithelial mesenchymal transition. More extensive 
      distant metastasis was also noted in an animal xenograft model when
      NCAM-expressing thyroid cancer cells were introduced into mice intravascularly.
      Bioinformatic analysis of NCAM-associated expression profiles predicted a highly 
      interactive protein network, which further implies potential molecular mechanisms
      underlying the metastatic processes of thyroid cancer.

AB  - Herein we report the design, preparation, and properties of a supramolecular
      system based on a tailored nitric oxide (NO) photodonor and a rhodamine-labeled
      beta-cyclodextrin conjugate. The combination of spectroscopic and photochemical
      experiments shows the absence of significant interchromophoric interactions
      between the host and the guest in the excited states. As a result, the complex is
      able to release NO under the exclusive control of visible light, as unambiguously
      demonstrated by direct detection of this transient species through an
      amperometric technique, and exhibits the typical red fluorescence of the
      rhodamine appendage. The supramolecular complex effectively internalizes in HeLa 
      cancer cells as proven by fluorescence microscopy, shows a satisfactory
      biocompatibility in the dark, and induces about 50% of cell mortality upon
      irradiation with visible light. The convergence of all these properties in one
      single complex makes the present host-guest ensemble an appealing candidate for
      further delevopment of photoactivatable nanoscaled systems addressed to
      photostimulated NO-based therapy.

TI  - Overcoming autopsy barriers in pediatric cancer research.
PG  - 204-9
LID - 10.1002/pbc.24320 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: More than 13,000 children annually in the United States and Canada
      under the age of 20 will be diagnosed with cancer at a mortality approaching 20% 
      1,2. Tumor samples obtained by autopsy provide an innovative way to study tumor
      progression, potentially aiding in the discovery of new treatments and increased 
      survival rates. The purpose of this study was to identify barriers to autopsies
      and develop guidelines for requesting autopsies for research purposes. PROCEDURE:
      Families of children treated for childhood cancer were referred by patient
      advocacy groups and surveyed about attitudes and experiences with research
      autopsies. From 60 interviews, barriers to autopsy and tumor banking were
      identified. An additional 14 interviews were conducted with medical and
      scientific experts. RESULTS: Ninety-three percent of parents of deceased children
      did or would have consented to a research autopsy if presented with the option;
      however, only half of these families were given the opportunity to donate autopsy
      tissue for research. The most significant barriers were the physicians'
      reluctance to ask a grieving family and lack of awareness about research
      opportunities. CONCLUSIONS: The value of donating tumor samples to research via
      an autopsy should be promoted to all groups managing pediatric cancer patients.
      Not only does autopsy tumor banking offer a potentially important medical and
      scientific impact, but the opportunity to contribute this Legacy Gift of autopsy 
      tumor tissue also creates a positive outlet for the grieving family. Taking these
      findings into account, our multidisciplinary team has developed a curriculum
      addressing key barriers.

TI  - Bone formation and resorption markers as diagnostic tools for bone metastases
      evaluation.
PG  - e395-9
LID - 10.5301/JBM.2012.9579 [doi]
AB  - Bone metastases are a frequent complication of several types of cancers. Since
      bone metastases are difficult to diagnose with the current available approaches, 
      there is a demand for new methods for assessing bone response. In this context,
      biochemical markers of bone remodeling may provide useful information on bone
      turnover that, in turn, may reflect disease activity in bone. In this study we
      tested a panel of bone remodeling markers (distinguishing between bone formation 
      and bone resorption ones) in different groups of cancer patients, so as to
      evaluate the potential clinical role of the examined bone remodeling markers in
      the early diagnosis of metastases formation and progression. Among the bone
      resorption markers, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP5b) resulted the 
      most specific for the metastatic tumor stage. Both the bone formation markers we 
      analyzed displayed a direct correlation (positive for bone-specific alkaline
      phosphatase [BAP] and negative for osteocalcin [OC]) with tumor disease
      progression, ranging from healthy controls to primary tumor and, ultimately, to
      the metastatic stage. Taken together our results suggest that these markers can
      be valuable tools to be used, in parallel with traditional methods of metastases 
      diagnosis, in order to monitor more in detail the pathological effect of
      metastases progression in bone tissue.

      patients treated with preoperative chemotherapy.
PG  - 17-23
LID - 10.5301/JBM.2012.9580 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To explore the significance of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) detection in
      the course of preoperative chemotherapy (PC) and their effect on the outcomes.
      METHODS: Fifty-five patients with stage II/III invasive breast cancer were
      enrolled into a preoperative clinical trial. Patients were given PC with
      sequential single-agent doxorubicin and paclitaxel vs paclitaxel followed by
      doxorubicin. Blood samples (8 mL) were collected from patients before PC, after
      each phase, and at 6 months intervals during follow-up. Peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells were isolated and enriched for epithelial cells. Quantitative
      RT-PCR was used to determine the presence of cytokeratin 19 (CK19) mRNA. Samples 
      were considered positive when the PCR curve crossed the standard threshold curve.
      RESULTS: After the first phase of chemotherapy, there was a 59% overall reduction
      in the median tumor volume. The percentage of volume reduction did not differ
      between patients who presented with detectable CTCs at baseline and those who did
      not (p=0.89). After the second phase of chemotherapy, there was a further
      decrease in the median tumor volume to 93% from baseline. There was no
      correlation between the lack of response and the presence of CTCs either after
      the first (p=0.36) or second (p=0.5391) phases of PC. The presence of CTCs was a 
      predictor of local or distant relapse (p=0.0411). The detection of CTCs did not
      affect overall survival (p=0.2569). CONCLUSION: CTCs can be used as predictors of
      relapse after definitive treatment of locally advanced breast cancer; however,
      CTCs detection in peripheral blood during the course of PC does not implicate a
      particular pattern of response to treatment.

      prostate cancer.
PG  - 43-8
LID - 10.5301/JBM.2012.9585 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The endothelial form of nitric oxide synthases (eNOS) seems to have
      an important role in vascular development, maintenance of the vascular tone and
      tumor growth in human prostate cancer (PC). The purpose of this study was to
      investigate the association between grade and stage of disease, age of diagnosis,
      vascular or perineural invasion, pre-diagnostic plasma prostate-specific antigen 
      (PSA) levels, prostate cancer risk and Glu298Asp polymorphism of the eNOS gene.
      METHODS: Ninety-five prostate cancer patients and 111 benign prostate hyperplasia
      subjects were included. The Glu298Asp polymorphism of the eNOS gene was
      determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length
      polymorphism RESULTS: The odds ratio (OR) between the GT and GG polymorphism was 
      0.76, indicating that the presence of the GT polymorphism decreased the risk of
      prostate cancer of more than 20% compared to the GG polymorphism. This
      difference, however, was not statistically significant. The GT polymorphism had
      an inverse association with cancer grade compared to the reference group
      (OR=0.47, p value=0.2). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that prostate cancer
      development is not associated with the Glu298Asp polymorphism of the endothelial 
      nitric oxide synthase gene in our population. Further studies in larger samples
      are needed to confirm our results and characterize the molecular mechanisms by
      which eNOS is involved in the susceptibility to prostate cancer.

LID - 10.5301/JBM.2012.9582 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: E-selectin is an adhesion molecule expressed on activated endothelial
      cells. E-selectin plays an important role in the process of inflammation and is
      also involved in the mechanism of cancer metastasis regulating the adhesion of
      circulating cancer cells to the blood vessels. The aim of our study was to
      determine whether an association exists between its most common gene
      polymorphism, S128R, and gastric cancer (GC). METHODS: We performed a
      case-control study of 88 GC cases and 480 controls to analyze the association
      between E-selectin S128R gene polymorphism and GC susceptibility. The genotyping 
      analysis was done by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method.
      RESULTS: The E-selectin S128R C allele, CA and CC genotypes were over-represented
      among the GC cases. No statistically significant association was observed between
      E-selectin S128R polymorphisms and tumor characteristics. However, carrying the C
      allele was associated with poor survival. CONCLUSIONS: The E-selectin S128R C
      allele may confer an increased susceptibility to gastric cancer development and
      correlate with a poor prognosis.

AB  - p63 is highly expressed in some malignant tumors and is associated with
      tumorigenesis, invasion and metastasis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the 
      clinical significance of p63 in colorectal cancer (CRC). p63 expression was
      detected by immunohistochemistry in 66 CRC patients. Correlations between p63
      expression and clinicopathological factors, progression-free survival (PFS) and
      overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Among the 66 CRC cases, 31 cases (47%)
      exhibited a high score of p63 expression, while 35 cases (53%) were marked with a
      low score. The p63 level correlated with peritumoral deposits (p=0.021). The
      5-year OS rates in the low p63 score and high p63 score groups were,
      respectively, 49% and 74% (p&lt;0.001). The 5-year PFS rates in the low p63 score
      and high p63 score groups were, respectively, 44% and 71% (p&lt;0.001).
      Univariate analysis revealed that p63 expression was correlated with OS and PFS. 
      Multivariate analysis suggested that p63 expression was an independent prognostic
      factor for OS (p=0.035). In conclusion, p63 was negatively correlated with
      peritumoral deposits and positively associated with OS and PFS in CRC. The data
      suggest that p63 is a potential prognostic factor for CRC.

TI  - Thymidylate synthase expression and prognosis in colorectal cancer: a
      meta-analysis of colorectal cancer survival data.
PG  - e203-11
LID - 10.5301/JBM.2012.9584 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although many studies have investigated the prognostic effect of
      thymidylate synthase (TS) in colorectal cancer, no consensus has been reached.
      The aim of this meta-analysis was to obtain a more precise estimate of the
      prognostic significance of TS expression in localized cancers treated by curative
      resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Seventeen eligible
      studies reporting survival in 2,893 patients stratified by TS expression were
      pooled using a fixed- or random-effects model. The main outcome measure was
      hazard ratio (HR). RESULTS: The overall HR for overall survival was 1.01 (95% CI 
      0.74-1.39, p=0.947), with an I2 of 64.4%. The total HR for disease-free survival 
      was 1.36 (95% CI 0.97-1.89, p=0.072), with an I2 of 75.8%. In the TS
      protein-tested subgroup, the total HR for disease-free survival was 1.72 (95% CI 
      1.02-2.89, p=0.042), with an I2 of 81.3%. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis showed
      that, in the adjuvant setting, TS expression does not predict a poorer
      disease-free survival or a worse overall survival. Therefore, we believe that it 
      is inappropriate to regard TS expression as a prognostic factor for patients with
      stage II and stage III colorectal cancer treated by surgery and adjuvant
      chemotherapy.

TI  - Microsatellite polymorphisms in the EGFR, NOTCH4 and E2F4 genes and their
      association with breast cancer risk.
PG  - e219-26
LID - 10.5301/JBM.2012.9583 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The sequences of many human genes that encode proteins involved in
      cancer contain polymorphic microsatellites. Variations in microsatellite length
      may constitute risk factors in several human diseases, a possibility that has
      been little explored in breast cancer. Among the genes that contain polymorphic
      microsatellites are EGFR, NOTCH4 and E2F4. The length of some of these
      microsatellites has been associated with breast cancer risk. PURPOSE AND METHODS:
      To determine whether the length of the microsatellites (CA)n in EGFR, (CTG)n in
      NOTCH4 and (AGC)n in E2F4 was associated with breast cancer risk, we genotyped
      these 3 microsatellites in 212 women with breast cancer and a control group of
      308 women from the general population who did not have this disease. RESULTS AND 
      CONCLUSIONS: The allelic distribution observed for the 3 microsatellites matched 
      that found in other white populations, with the exception of some (AGC)n alleles 
      in E2F4, which have not been described previously. The length of (CA)n in EGFR
      and (CTG)n in NOTCH4 was not associated with breast cancer (OR=0.99; 95% CI
      0.59-1.37; p=0.619 and OR=1.08; 95% CI 0.71-1.65; p=0.725, respectively). Short
      alleles (<13 repeats) of (AGC)n in E2F4 were less frequent in women with cancer
      than in the control sample.

TI  - A mixed method approach to describe the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
      families of children with cancer.
PG  - 438-45
LID - 10.1002/pbc.24324 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Families of children with cancer are confronted with a broad range of
      direct costs (out-of-pocket expenses), but the nature of these costs is poorly
      understood. This study aimed to disaggregate and describe these costs. PROCEDURE:
      A prospective, mixed method, cost-of-illness design was utilized. Starting in the
      fourth week following their child's diagnosis, parents recorded resources
      consumed, and costs incurred for 1 week per month for 3 consecutive months. Any
      additional costs not captured in this typical 1 week period were added for the
      remainder of the month. Parents also discussed their costs in an audio-taped
      interview at the end of the 3 months. Descriptive statistics and qualitative
      content analyses were performed to disaggregate and describe families' costs.
      RESULTS: In total, 99 families reported utilizing 16 cost categories and 74 cost 
      items. Nearly three quarters of these costs were attributed to travel (56%) and
      food (18%). Costly items included acquisition of a car ($CAD35,000), relocation
      of a family ($CAD6,000), and purchase of a wheelchair ($CAD6,800). Parents
      described facing significant out-of-pocket expenses to ensure that their children
      had access to cancer treatment, to cope with the clinical treatment side effects 
      of treatment, and to maintain the family household. CONCLUSION: Families of
      children with cancer experience a wide range of costs. Our understanding of the
      nature of their costs and resource use may formulate the basis for future cost
      assessments and provide insight into practice and policy changes aimed at
      lessening the economic impact of this burden.

TI  - Acute onset of ovarian dysfunction in young females after start of cancer
      treatment.
PG  - 676-81
LID - 10.1002/pbc.24327 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Female childhood cancer survivors are at risk of ovarian failure and 
      premature ovarian insufficiency. We hereby present an interim analysis of a
      prospective observational study of ovarian function during cancer treatment of
      young females in relation to clinical factors. PROCEDURE: Thirty-four consecutive
      female cancer patients aged 0-18 year were included after informed consent.
      Serum/Plasma levels of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), inhibin B, FSH, LH, and
      oestradiol (E2) were measured at diagnosis and every 3-4 months during and after 
      treatment. RESULTS: All patients had detectable AMH levels at diagnosis. Eleven
      patients had reached menarche (mean age 14(1/2) years) and the remaining patients
      had a mean age of 6(1/2) years. They all showed a rapid decline in AMH after 3
      months of treatment, regardless of AMH at diagnosis, age, menarche, or treatment 
      given. Those given radiotherapy below the diaphragm and/or stem cell
      transplantation (SCT) (n = 9) had no ovarian recovery during or 1(1/2)-year after
      treatment. However, recovery was observed in those given standard treatment for
      acute lymphatic leukemia (n = 7) already during maintenance chemotherapy. For the
      remaining patients, longer follow-up is required for analysis of ovarian recovery
      after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid ovarian dysfunction is observed in all
      females after initiation of cancer treatment as measured by AMH and inhibin B.
      Our data regarding those who require abdominal radiotherapy and/or SCT confirms
      the recommendations in the Nordic countries where these patients are eligible for
      cryopreservation of ovarian cortical tissue before start of cancer treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ensuring adequate parental consent is a key issue of ethical practice
      in pediatric oncology. In Germany, however, knowledge about parental
      comprehension and satisfaction with the informed consent procedure is limited,
      and representative data on parents' perspectives are still missing. Based on data
      collected by means of a population-based survey, we evaluated the parental recall
      of the informed consent process for pediatric clinical trials, and how they rated
      the consent process retrospectively. PROCEDURE: A standardized survey was carried
      out among 1,465 parents whose children were first diagnosed in 2005 with a
      disease defined by ICCC-3 in the German Childhood Cancer Registry (response:
      55.1%). The survey's primary objective was to assess how well parents were able
      to recall of the informed consent process. To evaluate the results, we set up a
      second survey among 581 parents who had given consent recently for their child's 
      participation in a clinical trial (response: 53.5%). RESULTS: Approximately 81%
      of the parents in the population-based survey correctly remembered whether or not
      their child had been enrolled in a clinical trial or treated off-trial. The
      ability to recall accurately is significantly lower if the parents have a
      migration background or if their child was not a trial participant. However,
      parents who recalled the child's trial participation status incorrectly felt as
      adequately informed as parents who recalled it correctly. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      results identified weak points and vulnerable subgroups in the parental consent
      process in pediatric oncology in Germany.

TI  - Sarcoidlike reaction of neoplasia causing hypermetabolic thoracic adenopathy in
      setting of extrathoracic malignancy: report of two cases and a review of the
      differential diagnostic considerations.
PG  - 231-5
LID - 10.2967/jnmt.112.102814 [doi]
AB  - The development of noncaseating granulomas in a patient with underlying
      malignancy and no symptoms or signs suggestive of systemic sarcoid is often
      referred to as a sarcoidlike reaction and is estimated to occur in a small but
      significant portion of cancer patients. The pathogenesis is poorly understood,
      but the entity is hypothesized to be an immune phenomenon representing a host
      defense mechanism against the spread of tumor cells. Sarcoidlike reactions can
      occur at any time from the time of diagnosis to several years afterward and may
      occur in lymph nodes draining a malignant tumor, in the tumor itself, and even in
      nonregional tissues. Like sarcoid, sarcoidlike reactions of neoplasia can
      demonstrate hypermetabolic lymph nodes on (18)F-FDG PET imaging and thus be
      readily confused with metastatic disease. We describe 2 cases of a sarcoidlike
      reaction of neoplasia presenting as hypermetabolic thoracic lymph nodes on
      (18)F-FDG PET/CT obtained for follow-up of extrathoracic malignancies: one a
      73-y-old woman with a history of stage III head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
      and the other a 34-y-old woman with recurrent giant cell tumor of the sacrum. In 
      both instances, the differential diagnosis for the finding of hypermetabolic
      thoracic lymph nodes included the possibility of a sarcoidlike reaction, though
      tissue sampling was pursued to exclude the more worrisome presence of metastatic 
      disease or, less likely, a new primary malignancy. We review the topic of
      sarcoidlike reactions of neoplasia as well as the analytic approach to
      hypermetabolic mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes encountered on (18)F-FDG PET/CT.

TI  - Histologic scoring of gastritis and gastric cancer in mouse models.
PG  - 189-203
AB  - Histopathology is a defining endpoint in mouse models of experimental gastritis
      and gastric adenocarcinoma. Presented here is an overview of the histology of
      gastritis and gastric cancer in mice experimentally infected with Helicobacter
      pylori or H. felis. A modular histopathologic scoring scheme is provided that
      incorporates relevant disease-associated changes. Whereas the guide uses
      Helicobacter infection as the prototype challenge, features may be applied to
      chemical and genetically engineered mouse models of stomach cancer as well.
      Specific criteria included in the combined gastric histologic activity index
      (HAI) include inflammation, epithelial defects, oxyntic atrophy, hyperplasia,
      pseudopyloric metaplasia, and dysplasia or neoplasia. Representative
      photomicrographs accompany descriptions for each lesion grade. Differentiation of
      genuine tumor invasion from pseudoinvasion is highlighted. A brief comparison of 
      normal rodent versus human stomach anatomy and physiology is accompanied by an
      introduction to mouse-specific lesions including mucous metaplasia and
      eosinophilic droplets (hyalinosis). In conjunction with qualified pathology
      support, this guide is intended to assist research scientists, postdoctoral
      fellows, graduate students, and medical professionals from affiliated disciplines
      in the interpretation and histologic grading of chronic gastritis and gastric
      carcinoma in mouse models.

AB  - The redistribution and trafficking patterns of cells to different anatomic sites 
      throughout the body is important during cancer development and metastasis.
      Interest in the origin and fate of gastric cancer stem cells has recently arisen,
      as it may explain the underlying mechanism of cancer development. The ability to 
      monitor the migration patterns of cancer stem cells is imperative to
      understanding the functional changes associated with the migration and
      proliferation of these cells. Here we detail a collection of techniques that
      include fluorescent in vivo imaging, X/Y FISH, and beta-galactosidase detection
      that are used for following labeled cells in vivo after adoptive transfer or
      transplant of donor cells for identifying the migration and engraftment of donor 
      cells within the recipient.

TI  - Increasing prevalence of comorbidity in patients with colorectal cancer in the
      South of the Netherlands 1995-2010.
PG  - 2157-63
LID - 10.1002/ijc.27871 [doi]
AB  - Comorbidity has large impact on colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment and outcomes
      and may increase as the population ages. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and 
      time trends of comorbid diseases in patients with CRC from 1995 to 2010. The
      Eindhoven Cancer Registry registers comorbidity in all patients with primary CRC 
      in the South of the Netherlands. We analyzed the prevalence of serious comorbid
      diseases in four time frames from 1995 to 2010. Thereby, we addressed its
      association with age, gender and socio-economic status (SES). The prevalence of
      comorbidity was registered in 27,339 patients with primary CRC. During the study 
      period, the prevalence of comorbidity increased from 47% to 62%, multimorbidity
      increased from 20% to 37%. Hypertension and cardiovascular diseases were most
      prevalent and increased largely over time (respectively 16-29% and 12-24%).
      Pulmonary diseases increased in women, but remained stable in men. Average age at
      diagnosis increased from 68.3 to 69.5 years (p = 0.004). A low SES and male
      gender were associated with a higher risk of comorbidity (not changing over
      time). This study indicates that comorbidity among patients with CRC is common,
      especially in males and patients with a low SES. The prevalence of comorbidity
      increased from 1995 to 2010, in particular in presumably nutritional diseases.
      Ageing, increased life expectancy and life style changes may contribute to more
      comorbid diseases. Also, improved awareness among health care providers on the
      importance of comorbidity may have resulted in better registration. The
      increasing burden of comorbidity in patients with CRC emphasizes the need for
      more focus on individualized medicine.

AB  - We report cancer incidence and mortality among Indigenous children in Australia
      and compare the results with corresponding data for non-Indigenous children. This
      information is important in understanding the overall burden of cancer in this
      population, and where disparities exist, to plan what action is required.
      Age-standardized rates, and indirectly standardized incidence and mortality
      ratios (SIRs and SMRs) were calculated for the years 1997-2008. There were 224
      cancers identified among Indigenous children (99.5 per million per year) and 52
      Indigenous children died from cancer during the study period (22.9 per million
      per year). The SIR for all cancers was 0.64 (95% CI = 0.56-0.73; P < 0.001) while
      the SMR was 0.81 (95% CI = 0.61-1.07). These results provide a baseline with
      which to monitor cancer among Indigenous children over time.

TI  - Both low and high serum IGF-I levels associate with cancer mortality in older
      men.
PG  - 4623-30
LID - 10.1210/jc.2012-2329 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although recent population-based studies suggest a U-shaped
      relationship between serum IGF-I concentration and all-cause mortality, the
      distribution of death causes underlying this association remains unclear. We
      hypothesized that high IGF-I levels associate with increased cancer mortality,
      whereas low IGF-I levels associate with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD)
      mortality. METHODS: Serum IGF-I levels were measured in 2901 elderly men (mean
      age 75.4, range 69-81 yr) included in the prospective population-based
      Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (Sweden) study. Mortality data were obtained 
      from central registers with no loss of follow-up. The statistical analyses
      included Cox proportional hazards regressions with or without a spline approach. 
      RESULTS: During the follow-up (mean 6.0 yr), 586 of the participants died (cancer
      deaths, n = 211; CVD deaths, n = 214). As expected, our data revealed a U-shaped 
      association between serum IGF-I levels and all-cause mortality. Low as well as
      high serum IGF-I (quintile 1 or 5 vs. quintiles 2-4) associated with increased
      cancer mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) =
      1.34-2.58; and HR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.37-2.65, respectively]. Only low serum IGF-I
      associated with increased CVD mortality (quintile 1 vs. quintiles 2-4, HR = 1.48,
      95% CI = 1.08-2.04). These associations remained after adjustment for multiple
      covariates and exclusion of men who died during the first 2 yr of follow-up.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that both low and high serum IGF-I levels
      are risk markers for increased cancer mortality in older men. Moreover, low IGF-I
      levels associate with increased CVD mortality.

TI  - Treatment patterns and clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic colorectal
      cancer initially treated with FOLFOX-bevacizumab or FOLFIRI-bevacizumab: results 
      from ARIES, a bevacizumab observational cohort study.
PG  - 1486-95
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2012-0190 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Avastin Registry: Investigation of Effectiveness and Safety
      (ARIES) study is a prospective, community-based observational cohort study that
      evaluated the effectiveness and safety of first-line treatment patterns,
      assessing the impact of chemotherapy choice and treatment duration. METHODS: The 
      ARIES study enrolled patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) receiving 
      first-line chemotherapy with bevacizumab and followed them longitudinally. The
      protocol did not specify treatment regimens or assessments. Analyses included all
      patients who initiated bevacizumab in combination with either first-line
      oxaliplatin with infusional 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFOX) or irinotecan 
      with infusional 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFIRI). Progression-free
      survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) times were estimated using Kaplan-Meier 
      methods. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with multivariate Cox regression
      analysis, adjusting for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: In total, 1,550
      patients with first-line mCRC were enrolled (median follow-up, 21 months) and
      most received FOLFOX-bevacizumab (n = 968) or FOLFIRI-bevacizumab (n = 243) as
      first-line therapy. The baseline characteristics and median treatment duration
      were generally similar between subgroups. There were no significant differences
      in the median PFS (10.3 months vs. 10.2 months) or OS (23.7 months vs. 25.5
      months) time between the FOLFOX-bevacizumab and FOLFIRI-bevacizumab subgroups,
      respectively, by unadjusted analyses. Multivariate analyses showed
      FOLFIRI-bevacizumab resulted in a similar PFS (HR, 1.03; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 0.88-1.21) and OS (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.78-1.16) outcome as with
      FOLFOX-bevacizumab. The incidence proportions of bevacizumab-associated adverse
      events were similar for FOLFOX- and FOLFIRI-based therapies. CONCLUSIONS: In
      first-line mCRC patients, the FOLFOX-bevacizumab and FOLFIRI-bevacizumab regimens
      were associated with similar treatment patterns and clinical outcomes.

TI  - Dry storage and transport of a cervicovaginal self-sample by use of the Evalyn
      Brush, providing reliable human papillomavirus detection combined with comfort
      for women.
PG  - 3937-43
LID - 10.1128/JCM.01506-12 [doi]
AB  - Primary screening using high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) detection has been
      suggested as a way of improving cervical cancer prevention. Women currently not
      attending screening (nonresponders) are more likely to participate when given the
      opportunity of self-sampling for hrHPV testing. The Evalyn Brush is a new
      cervicovaginal self-sampling device, developed specifically to meet women's
      demands, which is user-friendly and easy to use. The aims of this study were to
      investigate agreement of hrHPV detection by two PCR methods between the Evalyn
      Brush and physician-obtained samples and to study women's acceptance of this
      self-sampling device. Each of 134 women visiting the gynecology outpatient clinic
      collected a self-obtained sample (self-sample) and completed a questionnaire. The
      brush was stored dry. After self-sampling, a trained physician obtained a
      conventional cervical cytology specimen in ThinPrep medium. HrHPV detection was
      performed using the SPF(10)-DEIA-LiPA(25) and GP5+/6+-LQ-test. The overall
      agreement for hrHPV detection using SPF(10)-DEIA-LiPA(25) between the self-sample
      and the physician-taken sample was 85.8% (kappa value, 0.715; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 0.597 to 0.843; P = 1.000). The overall agreement for hrHPV
      detection using GP5+/6+-LQ between the self-sample and the physician-taken sample
      was 86.6% (kappa value, 0.725; 95% CI, 0.607 to 0.843; P = 0.815). Ninety-eight
      percent of the women rated their experience as good to excellent. Moreover, 95%
      of women preferred self-sampling to physician sampling. Self-sampling using the
      dry Evalyn Brush system is as good as a physician-taken sample for hrHPV
      detection and is highly acceptable to women. To validate this self-sampling
      device for clinical use, a large screening cohort should be studied.

TI  - Chemistry of the nudibranch Aldisa andersoni: structure and biological activity
      of phorbazole metabolites.
PG  - 1799-811
AB  - The first chemical study of the Indo-Pacific dorid nudibranch Aldisa andersoni
      resulted in the isolation of five chlorinated phenyl-pyrrolyloxazoles belonging
      to the phorbazole series. Two new molecules, 9-chloro-phorbazole D and
      N1-methyl-phorbazole A, co-occurring with known phorbazoles A, B and D, have been
      characterized. Phorbazoles were found to be present mainly in the external part
      of the mollusc. The structures of the new compounds were determined by
      interpretation of spectroscopic data, mainly NMR and mass spectrometry and by
      comparison with the literature data. Evaluation of feeding-deterrence activity as
      well as in vitro growth inhibitory properties in human cancer cells was also
      carried out.

TI  - Cellular mechanisms of zinc dysregulation: a perspective on zinc homeostasis as
      an etiological factor in the development and progression of breast cancer.
PG  - 875-903
AB  - Worldwide, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women and is
      the leading cause of female cancer deaths. Zinc (Zn) functions as an antioxidant 
      and plays a role in maintaining genomic stability. Zn deficiency results in
      oxidative DNA damage and increased cancer risk. Studies suggest an inverse
      association between dietary and plasma Zn levels and the risk for developing
      breast cancer. In contrast, breast tumor biopsies display significantly higher Zn
      levels compared with normal tissue. Zn accumulation in tumor tissue also
      correlates with increased levels of Zn importing proteins. Further, aberrant
      expression of Zn transporters in tumors correlates with malignancy, suggesting
      that altered metal homeostasis in the breast could contribute to malignant
      transformation and the severity of cancer. However, studies have yet to link
      dysregulated Zn transport and abnormal Zn-dependent functions in breast cancer
      development. Herein, we summarize studies that address the multi-modal role of Zn
      dyshomeostasis in breast cancer with respect to the role of Zn in modulating
      oxidative stress, DNA damage response/repair pathways and cell
      proliferation/apoptosis, and the relationship to aberrant regulation of Zn
      transporters. We also compare Zn dysregulation in breast tissue to that of
      prostate, pancreatic and ovarian cancer where possible.

TI  - PSA-based screening for prostate cancer. Too many adverse effects.
PG  - 215-7
AB  - Has the evaluation of PSA screening for prostate cancer progressed since 2009? We
      examined the recent literature on the value of this test, using the standard
      Prescrire methodology. Five randomised trials have yielded conflicting results.
      One trial was too flawed to be conclusive. In two trials, the Erspc and
      Gothenburg studies, PSA-based screening appeared to prevent about 1 death from
      prostate cancer per 300 to 1400 men screened. However, two other trials,
      including the PLCO study that enrolled 77 000 men, showed no statistically
      significant benefit from screening. Two meta-analyses showed that PSA screening
      did not reduce mortality from prostate cancer among 340 000 and 390 000 men
      followed for 9 to 15 years. About 70% of men with PSA levels above 4 ng/l do not 
      have prostate cancer. These false-positive results unnecessarily expose patients 
      to the adverse effects of prostate biopsy, which include haematuria, pain,
      infections and septicaemia. Between 30% and 80% of cancers diagnosed by screening
      would never have compromised patients' health if they had remained undetected.
      This over-diagnosis unnecessarily exposes patients to the adverse effects of
      treatment, which include urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and
      psychological effects. In early 2012, the clinical utility of PSA-based screening
      for prostate cancer has not been demonstrated. Patients should be informed of the
      natural history of localised prostate cancer and the adverse effects of
      screening.

AB  - To determine the characteristics and regularity of multi-detector CT (MDCT) in
      breast cancer with skeletal thorax metastasis, we retrospectively analyzed the
      imaging findings of MDCT in 72 cases of breast cancer with bone metastasis before
      treatment. There were totally 455 metastasis involved sites. The most common
      metastatic site was thoracic vertebra. And the fourth left rib was most common
      lesion in rib metastasis. Right breast cancer was more likely to take place at
      the bilateral ribs (65%) and pectoral girdle (54.5%) metastasis. The lesions in
      28 cases demonstrated osteolytic destruction (38.9%), while 30 cases showed
      osteogenic appearance (41.7%). In conclusion, the development of breast cancer
      with skeletal thorax metastasis has certain characteristics and regularity.

      cervico-thoracic junctional region].
PG  - 624-8
AB  - To determine the relevance between MDCT features and anatomic-pathological basis 
      of lymphoid neoplasm in cervico-thoracic junctional region, we performed a
      retrospective analysis of 69 patients with lymphoid neoplasm (lymphoma: 41
      patients; metastatic tumor: 28 patients) involving the cervico-thoracic
      junctional region for MDCT features and distribution of lesions. The relevance
      between MDCT features and the anatomic-pathological basis in this region were
      evaluated. Among all the 41 patients with lymphoma, 29 with NHL (70.7%), 12 with 
      HD (29.3%). The lymphomatous lymphadenopathy mainly located in superficial
      lateral cervix (51.2%, 21/41) ,deep jugular chain (65.9%, 27/41), supraclavicular
      fossa (75.6%, 31/41), paratrachea space in anterior mediastinum (46.3%, 19/41),
      around aortic arch (56.1%, 23/41), aortopulmonary window (53.7%, 22/41), upper
      anterior mediastinum (41.5%, 17/41), subcarinal space (26.8%, 11/41) and
      paraesophageal space (17.1%, 7/41). 28 patients had metastatic lymphoid tumor.
      The primary tumor were nasopharynx tumor (5 patients), thyroid cancer (7
      patients), lung cancer (10 patients), and esophageal cancer (6 patients). Most
      metastasis took stage by stage in the way of lymphatic return, but a minority of 
      cases migrated jumpily. The main metastatic sites were: beside jugular chain
      (82.1%), supraclavicular fossa (75%), paratracheal in anterior mediastinum
      (60.7%), upper anterior mediastinum (64.3%), beside aortic arch (35.7%),
      aortopulmonary window (39.2%), and paraesophageal space (28.6%). So lymphoid
      neoplasms in cervico-thoracic junctional region were involving both lower cervix 
      and upper thorax simultaneously. The MDCT features and main distribution of
      lesions correlated with the anatomic-pathological characteristics in this region.

PG  - 737-44
AB  - This experimental study was aimed to construct the recombinant bisbicistronic
      eukaryotic expression vector containing endocrine and exocrine protein (EECP)
      gene associated with breast cancer and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) 
      gene. And then we transfected it into breast cancer cells MCF-7 to detect the
      expression of EECP protein and study preliminary biological function of EECP
      gene. The EECP sequence was cloned to pBluescript II SK (+) plasmid. After
      restriction endonuclease reaction of pBluescript II SK(+) plasmid, the EECP
      fragment was cloned to pIRES2-EGFP vector forming a recombinant eukaryotic
      expression vector named pEECP-IRES2-EGFP. The potential vector was identified by 
      restriction endonuclease digestion and sequencing. Correct plasmid was extracted 
      and transfected into breast cancer cells MCF-7. The expression of EECP protein
      was detected by western blot analysis. Its biological function was studied by MTT
      and Flow-cytometry. It turns out that the recombinant eukaryotic expression
      vector containing EECP gene and EGFP gene was constructed successfully, and it
      could transfect MCF-7 cells efficiently. It can get higher expression of EECP
      protein and higher cell proliferation, thus providing an important and convenient
      tool for studying the function of EECP gene in vitro and in vivo.

TI  - [Review on the research progress of the role of miRNAs in gastric cancer].
PG  - 780-3, 802
AB  - MicroRNAs, known as small noncoding MiRNAs, 19 to 24 nt in length, are important 
      gene regulators and recognized as key players in carcinogenesis. The mechanism
      lies in that the MiRNAs can conjugate with their targeted mRNA and then lead to
      the targeted mRNA degradation or repress their translation. Bioinformatic
      analysis indicates that each MiRNA can regulate hundreds of gene targets and
      could serve functionally as "oncogenes" or "tumor suppressor genes", and
      therefore regulate multiple cellular processes relevant to carcinogenesis and
      cancer progression. Up to now, there have been a lot of studies about the MiRNAs 
      which may play an important role in stomach neoplasms. The purpose of this paper 
      is to have a review of the present studies on the MiRNAs related to stomach
      neoplasms, in order set basis for further study and their clinical application.

TI  - [The application of stereology in radiology imaging and cell biology fields].
PG  - 793-7
AB  - Stereology is an interdisciplinary method for 3D morphological study developed
      from mathematics and morphology. It is widely used in medical image analysis and 
      cell biology studies. Because of its unbiased, simple, fast, reliable and
      non-invasive characteristics, stereology has been widely used in biomedical areas
      for quantitative analysis and statistics, such as histology, pathology and
      medical imaging. Because the stereological parameters show distinct differences
      in different pathology, many scholars use stereological methods to do
      quantitative analysis in their studies in recent years, for example, in the areas
      of the condition of cancer cells, tumor grade, disease development and the
      patient's prognosis, etc. This paper describes the stereological concept and
      estimation methods, also illustrates the applications of stereology in the fields
      of CT images, MRI images and cell biology, and finally reflects the universality,
      the superiority and reliability of stereology.

TI  - Preparation, characterization and anticancer activity of norcantharidin-loaded
      poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(caprolactone) amphiphilic block copolymer micelles.
PG  - 781-8
AB  - In this study, a novel amphiphilic block copolymer biomaterial - poly (ethylene
      glycol)-poly (caprolactone) (PEG-PCL), was used to entrap norcantharidin (NCTD), 
      taking advantage of self-assembly theory. Dialysis and volatilization dialysis
      were used to prepare copolymer micelles. Drug-loaded micelles were compared with 
      blank micelles in terms of their particle diameter, morphology and IR spectral
      characteristics. The results revealed that there was no significant difference in
      respect of morphology and IR spectrum, but particle size differed. Drug-loaded
      micelles had a smaller particle size than blank micelles. Three important factors
      influencing particle size, the drug loading content (LC) and the drug entrapment 
      efficiency (EE) of the NCTD-loaded micelles, were studied. The results indicated 
      that the method of preparation and the type of organic solvent had a significant 
      influence on the size of the micelles. LC and EE were greatly affected by the
      ratio of NCTD to copolymer. In vitro release of NCTD from the conjugate micelles 
      showed that its release rate depended on the pH of the phosphate buffer solution 
      (PBS). The amount released was higher at lower pH than under neutral conditions. 
      In vitro antitumor activity of the NCTD conjugate against human hepatoma (HepG2) 
      cell line and human lung cancer (A549) cell line was evaluated by the MTT method.
      Micelles loaded with NCTD demonstrated greater and more satisfactory cell
      viability inhibition than the free drug. In vivo antitumor activity of
      drug-loaded micelles was investigated in mice bearing S180 mouse sarcoma.
      NCTD-loaded micelles displayed tumor inhibition effects, better than the free
      drug. As a new drug delivery system, copolymer micelles present many advantages
      including easy formulation, good water solubility, low toxicity and high
      treatment efficacy, and show great potential as carriers of hydrophobic drugs.

TI  - A new method for lung cancer prognosis via centrosome image feature analysis.
PG  - 180-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To predict survival of resected stage I non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) patients through quantitative analysis and classification of centrosome
      features. STUDY DESIGN: Disordered centrosome amplification leads to the loss of 
      regulated chromosome segregation, aneuploidy and chromosome instability and may
      be a biomarker of cancer prognosis. Resected, stage I NSCLC tissues from survivor
      and fatal cases were immunostained with gamma-tubulin and scanned by confocal
      microscopy. Regions of interest were selected to include 1 cell and at least 1
      centrosome. Four hundred forty-six regions were imaged, including 903 centrosomes
      whose features were extracted and measured. After segmentation, 12 centrosome
      features were measured. After optimization, 6 non-redundant features were
      selected for statistical analysis and classification. RESULTS: Two statistical
      methods showed that for each feature, centrosomes from survivors differed
      significantly from centrosomes of fatalities. Centrosomes were classified into
      survival or fatal outcomes by centrosome features using linear discriminant
      analysis, support vector machines (SVMs) and further optimized using SVMs with
      bagging. Ten-fold cross-validation was applied. Classification accuracies were
      74%, 79% and 85%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Centrosome features can be a
      prognostic biomarker for resected stage I NSCLC and may indicate patients who
      would benefit from additional adjuvant therapy.

PG  - 189-94
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study elderly women > or = 60 years of age diagnosed with breast
      cancer and analyze this cohort according to death from breast cancer and death
      due to comorbidities. Patients aged 60-69 years of age were included in routine
      mammography screening, but not women aged > or = 70 years. This enabled a
      comparison between the 2 groups regarding screening effect, tumor size and
      survival in breast cancer. STUDY DESIGN: A consecutive sample of 311 breast
      cancer patients > or = 60 years of age from 1991 were analyzed according to tumor
      size at diagnosis, frequencies of lymph node metastasis, tumor histological grade
      and stage, ploidy, proliferation index, stem-line-scatter index and survival rate
      in breast cancer and other causes of death. Tumor size was compared to a patient 
      group aged 60-69 from 1987, before the introduction of mammography screening in
      Sweden. RESULTS: In the screening group a significant reduction in tumor size was
      found at diagnosis compared to the sample from 1987 (p < 0.001) and to the older 
      group > or = 70 years (p < 0.02). In the latter group a higher death rate
      appeared for breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Older women would have a better outcome
      if included in the mammography screening program.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Study Type - Therapy (phase 1) Level of Evidence 2a What's known on
      the subject? and What does the study add? High-risk and locally advanced prostate
      cancers are difficult to cure with the standard regimen of radiation therapy (RT)
      with concurrent androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Multiple studies have
      explored the addition of docetaxel chemotherapy in attempt to improve patient
      outcomes. Prior Phase I studies have shown that docetaxel 20 mg/m(2) is a safe
      dose, when given concurrently with 70 Gy of radiation. But current standard RT
      for prostate cancer uses higher doses, and it is unclear if concurrent
      chemotherapy is safe with modern RT. This is a Phase I study that explored the
      addition of concurrent docetaxel chemotherapy to modern RT (intensity-modulated
      RT to 78 Gy) plus ADT. The study showed that weekly docetaxel at 20 mg/m(2) is
      safe with modern RT. At a median follow-up of 2.2 years, biochemical
      progression-free survival was 94%. This triple-therapy regimen is safe and
      promising for further evaluation in prospective trials. OBJECTIVE: * To evaluate 
      in a phase I trial, the feasibility of adding concurrent weekly docetaxel
      chemotherapy to high-dose intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and
      androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for treatment of high-risk prostate cancer.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: * Patients with high-risk prostate cancer were treated with
      a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist (starting 2-3 months before IMRT 
      and lasting 2 years), IMRT of 78 Gy to the prostate and seminal vesicles, and
      weekly docetaxel during RT. * All patients had computed tomography and bone scans
      to exclude metastatic disease. * A standard 3 + 3 design was used for docetaxel
      dose escalation. Successive patients were treated on dose levels of 10, 15, and
      20 mg/m(2) of weekly docetaxel. RESULTS: * In all, 18 patients participated in
      the study: 15 (83%) had Gleason 8-10 disease; the other three had either clinical
      T3 disease and/or a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of >20 ng/mL. * Grade 3
      diarrhoea (a defined dose-limiting toxicity, DLT) occurred in one patient in each
      of the first two dose levels. However, when the cohorts were expanded, no further
      DLT was seen. * Weekly docetaxel at 20 mg/m(2) (dose level 3) was successfully
      given without DLT. * No patient had grade 4 or 5 toxicity. * At a median
      follow-up of 2.2 years, all patients achieved a PSA nadir of <1 ng/mL, including 
      13 patients who had an undetectable PSA level. The 2-year biochemical
      progression-free survival was 94%. CONCLUSION: * A dose of 20 mg/m(2) of weekly
      docetaxel given concurrently with high-dose IMRT and ADT appears safe for further
      study in patients with high-risk prostate cancer.

PG  - 1315-29
AB  - Various types of cancers (including gliomas, melanomas, and esophageal, pancreas 
      and non-small-cell lung cancers) display intrinsic resistance to pro-apoptotic
      stimuli, such as conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and/or the
      activation of a multidrug resistance phenotype, which are major barriers to
      effective treatment and lead to poor patient prognosis. The DYRK1A kinase is
      directly implicated in the resistance of cancer cells to pro-apoptotic stimuli
      and drives several pathways that enhance proliferation, migration, and the
      reduction of cell death, leading to very aggressive biological behavior in cancer
      cell populations. The DYRK1A kinase is also implicated in neurological diseases
      and in neoangiogenic processes. Thus, the DYRK1A kinase is of great interest for 
      both cancer and neuroscience research. During the last decade, numerous compounds
      that inhibit DYRK1A have been synthesized. The present review discusses the
      available molecules known to interfere with DYRK1A activity and the implications 
      of DYRK1A in cancer and other diseases and serves as a rational analysis for
      researchers who aim to improve the anti-DYRK1A activity of currently available
      compounds.

TI  - Enzyme induction with antiepileptic drugs: cause for concern?
PG  - 11-27
LID - 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2012.03671.x [doi]
AB  - Several commonly prescribed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)-including phenobarbital,
      phenytoin, and carbamazepine-stimulate the synthesis of a broad range of
      monooxygenase and conjugating enzymes. These agents are well known to reduce the 
      duration and action of many lipid- and non-lipid-soluble drugs, including
      anticoagulants, cytotoxics, analgesics, antiretrovirals, glucocorticoids,
      statins, antihypertensives, oral contraceptives, psychoactive drugs,
      immunosuppressants, and of course, other AEDs. This process, therefore, may be
      associated with a number of clinical problems including higher cancer mortality, 
      progressive AIDS, transplant rejection, and unwanted pregnancy. Withdrawal of
      enzyme-inducing AEDs will increase the concentration of induced drugs, bringing
      with it substantial risk of toxicity if doses are not concomitantly reduced. Yet 
      the potential widespread adverse health consequences of these interactions, both 
      with AED initiation and withdrawal, remain largely underappreciated. Furthermore,
      induction also affects enzymes involved in endogenous metabolic pathways, and can
      alter bone biochemistry, gonadal steroids, and lipid markers. Therefore,
      enzyme-inducing AEDs may contribute to the development of a number of
      comorbidities, including osteoporosis, sexual dysfunction, and vascular disease. 
      This process continues as long as the patient takes the inducer. Modern AEDs that
      do not possess this property have similar efficacy for the common epilepsies.
      Accordingly, perhaps consideration should be given to starting treatment with, or
      even switching patients to, non-enzyme-inducing AEDs.

AB  - Medical imaging tests of breast cancer patients can be used to detect and provide
      information on the location of multiple malignant lesions within a patient.
      Within this context, it is often the case that one needs to evaluate the accuracy
      of an imaging test for finding the multiple lesions in a patient rather than
      simply detecting that a patient has disease. A natural way to approach this task 
      is to estimate the accuracy of the test using a lesion-level analysis.
      Sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are 
      analytic measures that are frequently used to quantify the accuracy of medical
      tests. When the test or radiologist must first locate the lesions, however, it is
      not possible to directly estimate the specificity or an ROC curve keeping the
      individual lesions as the unit of analysis. The goal of this study is to
      demonstrate to clinicians conducting or reviewing studies evaluating breast
      imaging tests what measures of accuracy can and cannot be calculated in different
      types of studies and to describe in detail the difficulty with calculating
      specificity and ROC curves in a lesion-level analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the differential response to systemic chemotherapy in
      patients undergoing simultaneous orchidectomy and retroperitoneal lymph node
      dissection (RPLND) after chemotherapy for metastatic testicular cancer. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: Patients who underwent simultaneous RPLND and orchidectomy after
      chemotherapy were identified from our clinical databases. Postoperative
      pathological findings and patient characteristics were reviewed. RESULTS: In all,
      42 patients were identified. After chemotherapy, necrosis, teratoma and cancer
      were identified in 25 (59.5%), 14 (33.3%) and three (7.1%) RPLN specimens and 15 
      (35.7%), 15 (35.7%) and 12 (28.6%) orchidectomy specimens respectively. Of the 25
      patients with necrotic RPLN specimens 12 (48.0%) had active disease within the
      orchidectomy specimen (eight invasive cancer and four mature teratoma). The
      overall histological discordance rate was 38.1%. Findings in the orchidectomy
      specimens were more aggressive than those in the RPLN specimens (i.e. cancer
      worse than teratoma, which is worse than necrosis) in 33.3%. CONCLUSIONS: There
      is significant disparity between orchidectomy and RPLND findings with viable
      tumour appearing frequently in the testis despite tumour-free RPLNs. These
      findings support completion orchidectomy as part of advanced testicular germ cell
      treatment.

AB  - Significant advances in our understanding of the biology of renal cell carcinoma 
      (RCC) have been achieved in recent years. These insights have led to the
      introduction of novel targeted therapies, revolutionising the management of
      patients with advanced disease. Nevertheless, there are still no biomarkers in
      routine clinical use in RCC. Tools used routinely to determine prognosis have not
      changed over the past decade; classification remains largely morphology based;
      and patients continue to be exposed to potentially toxic therapy with no
      indication of the likelihood of response. Thus the need for biomarkers in RCC is 
      urgent. Here, we focus on recent advances in our understanding of the genetics
      and epigenetics of RCC, and the potential for such knowledge to provide novel
      markers and therapeutic targets. We highlight on-going research that is likely to
      deliver further candidate markers as well as generating large, well-annotated
      sample banks that will facilitate future studies. It is imperative that promising
      candidates are validated using these resources, and in subsequent prospective
      clinical trials, so that future biomarkers may be used in the clinic to
      personalize patient care.

TI  - Antiangiogenic function of antithrombin is dependent on its conformational
      variation: implication for other serpins.
PG  - 403-11
AB  - Endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor that specifically decreases tumor cell
      proliferation can be used to treat cancer since angiogenesis is required at every
      step of tumor progression and metastasis. Endothelial cells are the main target
      for the antiangiogenic therapy because they are non-transformed and easily
      accessible to angiogenic inhibitors. Antithrombin functions as a principal plasma
      protein inhibitor of blood coagulation proteinases and belongs to the family of
      serine protease inhibitors (serpins) which have common mechanism of inhibition.
      Antithrombin acquires a potent antiangiogenic activity upon conversion of the
      native molecule to cleaved or latent conformation. Cleaved and latent
      preparations of bovine and human plasma derived antithrombin inhibits capillary
      endothelial cell proliferation and the growth of human SK-NAS neuroblastoma and
      Lewis lung carcinoma tumors in mice but not the native antithrombin's. The native
      form of antithrombin binds with high affinity to vascular heparan sulfate
      proteoglycans containing a specific pentasaccharide sequence and it is this
      cofactor interaction that activates antithrombin to maximal rate of thrombin
      inhibition. Upon inhibitory complex formation with target proteinases the
      antithrombin undergoes stressed to relaxed transformation and lose their high
      affinity for pentasacchride. Low affinity relaxed conformation with reduced
      heparin binding like cleaved and latent are antiangiogenic but native high
      affinity heparin binding stressed conformation is not, indicating the critical
      importance of heparin affinity in antithrombin antiangiogenic function. Based on 
      evidence of interactions of the endothelial cell growth factors bFGF (basic
      fibroblast growth factor) and VEGF (vascular endothelial cell growth factor) with
      heparin like molecule in matrix, the possibility of antiangiogenic antithrombin
      to interfere with endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis through heparin
      mediated mechanism deserves serious consideration and investigation. It is also
      possible that cleaved and latent conformations with reduced affinity for heparins
      can also induce conformational change in the antithrombin which can open an
      epitope on the antithrombin surface for appropriate interactions on the
      endothelial surface for better antiangiogenic activity. This review illustrates
      the potential of antithrombin and other serpin family members as endogenous
      antiangiogenic proteins.

TI  - Chemopreventive properties of Peptide Lunasin: a review.
PG  - 424-32
AB  - Cancer has become one the most common causes of death in developed countries and 
      has been defined as the medical challenge of our times. Accumulating evidence
      support the notion that prevention can be a major component of cancer control.
      Chemoprevention, a relatively new and promising strategy to prevent cancer, is
      defined as the use of natural and/or synthetic substances to block, reverse, or
      retard the process of carcinogenesis. Plant-based foods, containing significant
      amounts of bioactive phytochemicals, may provide desiderable health benefits
      beyond basic nutrition to reduce the process of cancer. In the last few years,
      proteins and peptides have become one group of nutraceuticals that show potential
      results in preventing the different stages of cancer including initiation,
      promotion, and progression. Lunasin is a 43- amino acid peptide identified in
      soybean and other plants whose anti-carcinogenic activity has been demonstrated
      both in in vitro and in vivo assays. Moreover, this peptide has been found to
      exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that could contribute to its
      chemopreventive effects. Lunasin's bioactivity and its molecular mechanism(s) of 
      actions are summarized in this review.

TI  - Synergistic enhancement of cancer therapy using a combination of fusion protein
      MG7-scFv/SEB and tumor necrosis factor alpha.
PG  - 467-72
AB  - The fusion protein MG7-scFv/SEB has shown anti-tumor activity on gastric cancer
      in vitro and in vivo. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a cytokine
      exerting anti-tumor effectiveness in various models and modes of applications. In
      this study, we explored the combination effects of MG7-scFv/SEB and TNF-alpha in 
      experimental gastric cancer. Both MG7-scFv/SEB and TNF-alpha could effectively
      result in a significant inhibition of tumor growth in our experimental models
      when administered alone. What's more, MG7-scFv/SEB synergized with TNF-alpha in
      further reducing the growth of gastric tumors in gastric-tumor-bearing rats as
      compared to mono therapy. Additionally, the survival rate of gastric-tumorbearing
      rats administrated with combined therapy was significantly higher than that of
      rats treated with MG7-scFv/SEB or TNF-alpha. These results indicate that combined
      therapy with MG7-scFv/SEB and TNF-alpha is a promising strategy for human cancer 
      therapy.

TI  - Isolation of a phytase with distinctive characteristics from an edible mushroom, 
      Pleurotus eryngii.
PG  - 459-66
AB  - From the fresh fruiting bodies of the mushroom Pleurotus eryngii a phytase with a
      molecular mass of 14 kDa was isolated. The isolation protocol entailed ion
      exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and CM-cellulose, affinity
      chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, and ion exchange chromatography on
      Q-Sepharose. The phytase was unadsorbed on DEAE-cellulose, CM-cellulose and
      Affi-gel blue gel, and adsorbed on Q-Sepharose. It appeared as a single band in
      SDSPAGE. It exhibited maximal activity at around 37 degrees C. Its activity
      underwent little changes over the range of pH 3.0 to 9.0. The aforementioned
      characteristics are different from those of animal, plant and bacterial phytases.
      The low molecular mass and pH stability of P. eryngii phytase also distinguish it
      from mushroom phytases and other fungal phytases reported earlier. The purified
      enzyme exhibited a broad substrate specificity on a range of phosphorylated
      compounds, and the phytase demonstrated the N-terminal sequence ADNVYRHDNN which 
      shows little homology to known phytases. It inhibited proliferation of human
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma CNE2 cells, hepatoma HepG2 cells and breast cancer MCF7 
      cells with an IC(50) of 1.9 muM, 2.9 muM, and 1.0 muM, respectively.

TI  - Anticancer peptides and proteins: a panoramic view.
PG  - 380-91
AB  - Despite progress in understanding carcinogenesis, cancer is still a major cause
      of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Treatment is complicated by the resistance 
      to chemotherapeutics acquired by tumors, ability to repair damaged DNA,
      alteration of the interaction between drug and its target, and defects in the
      machinery that leads to apoptosis. The development of novel therapies based on
      biologically active peptides, especially antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), and
      proteins has emerged as a new strategy to defeat cancer.

TI  - Type I interferons: ancient peptides with still under-discovered anti-cancer
      properties.
PG  - 412-23
AB  - Type I interferons (IFNs) represent a group of cytokines that act through a
      common receptor composed by two chains (IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2). Several in vitro
      and in vivo studies showed a potent antitumor activity induced by these
      cytokines. IFN-alpha, the first cytokine to be produced by recombinant DNA
      technology, has emerged as an important regulator of cancer cell growth and
      differentiation, affecting cellular communication and signal transduction
      pathways. IFN-alpha, is currently the most used cytokine in the treatment of
      cancer. However, the potential anti-tumour activity of IFN-alpha is limited by
      the activation of tumour resistance mechanisms. This article reviews the current 
      knowledge about the antitumor activity of type I IFNs, focusing on new potential 
      strategies able to strengthen the antitumor activity of these cytokines.

TI  - lGnRH-III -- a promising candidate for anticancer drug development.
PG  - 439-49
AB  - Lamprey gonadotropin-releasing hormone-III (lGnRH-III;
      Glp-His-Trp-Ser-His-Asp-Trp-Lys-Pro-Gly-NH2), a native isoform of human GnRH
      (GnRH-I), was initially isolated from the brain of the sea lamprey (Petromyzon
      marinus). It is a weak GnRH agonist, which exerts a direct antiproliferative
      effect on cancer cells and has an insignificant LH and FSH releasing potency in
      mammals. These features reveal the advantages of lGnRH-III and its derivatives
      for use in cancer therapy. Here we give an overview of various strategies to
      increase the antitumor activity of lGnRH-III, such as amino acid replacement,
      cyclization, dimerization and conjugation to polymers or to chemotherapeutic
      agents. In vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of lGnRH-III based compounds was 
      demonstrated both on hormone dependent and independent tumors.

TI  - Phosphonic esters and their application of protease control.
PG  - 1154-78
AB  - alpha-Aminoalkylphosphonate diaryl esters are potent, irreversible, and highly
      selective site-directed inhibitors of serine proteases. The structure of the
      phosphonate group resembles the transition state observed during a peptide bond
      hydrolysis and therefore phosphonates are referred as transition state analogues.
      They react with the hydroxyl group of the active site serine residue leading to
      formation of a stable enzyme-inhibitor complex. Moreover, incorporation of a
      peptidyl chain at the N-terminus as well as an introduction of electron
      withdrawing or electron donating substituents within the ester ring structure
      allows for a generation of specific inhibitors that react only with target serine
      protease. The great advantage of the aminophosphonate diaryl esters over other
      classes of inhibitors is their stability in aqueous solutions, no toxicity and
      lack of reactivity with cysteine, threonine, aspartyl and metalloproteinases. The
      above resulted in their application as convenient tools to study proteases
      function and activity using in vivo and in vitro assays of different pathological
      disorders (diabetes, cancer metastasis, pulmonary diseases or hypertension); to
      determine the cellular localization of the proteinases (activity based probes),
      to be used in proteomic approach or as the reactive antigens to develop a
      catalytic function within the antibodies binding site. Herein we present the
      development of alpha-aminoalkylphosphonate diaryl esters as inhibitors of several
      serine proteases including dipeptidyl peptidase IV, cathepsin G, human neutrophil
      elastase, mast cell chymase and urokinase-type plasminogen activator. We have
      provided a historical perspective as well as a comprehensive report of the most
      recent studies in this field.

TI  - HtrA protease family as therapeutic targets.
PG  - 977-1009
AB  - The HtrA proteases degrade damaged proteins and thus control the quality of
      proteins and protect cells against the consequences of various stresses; they
      also recognize specific protein substrates and in this way participate in
      regulation of many pathways. In many pathogenic bacteria strains lacking the HtrA
      function lose virulence or their virulence is decreased. This is due to an
      increased vulnerability of bacteria to stresses or to a decrease in secretion of 
      virulence factors. In some cases HtrA is secreted outside the cell, where it
      promotes the pathogen's invasiveness. Thus, the HtrA proteases of bacterial
      pathogens are attractive targets for new therapeutic approaches aimed at
      inhibiting their proteolytic activity. The exported HtrAs are considered as
      especially promising targets for chemical inhibitors. In this review, we
      characterize the model prokaryotic HtrAs and HtrAs of pathogenic bacteria,
      focusing on their role in virulence. In humans HtrA1, HtrA2(Omi) and HtrA3 are
      best characterized. We describe their role in promoting cell death in stress
      conditions and present evidence indicating that HtrA1 and HtrA2 function as tumor
      suppressors, while HtrA2 stimulates cancer cell death induced by chemotherapeutic
      agents. We characterize the HtrA2 involvement in pathogenesis of Parkinson's and 
      Alzheimer's diseases, and briefly describe the involvement of human HtrAs in
      other diseases. We hypothesize that stimulation of the HtrA's proteolytic
      activity might be beneficial in therapies of cancer and neurodegenerative
      disorders, and discuss the possibilities of modulating HtrA proteolytic activity 
      considering the present knowledge about their structure and regulation.

TI  - In search of legitimacy--registered nurses' experience of providing palliative
      care in a municipal context.
PG  - 651-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1471-6712.2012.01074.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The palliative care approach was originally developed for hospice
      care and for persons with cancer diseases, but has gradually expanded to embrace 
      other contexts and people of all ages, with various life-threatening diseases.
      The palliative care concept thus also applies to older people and the context of 
      municipal care, where Registered Nurses (RNs) hold key care provision positions. 
      The municipal context is not, however, focused primarily on advanced nursing
      care, and it is important to highlight RNs' prerequisites for care provision.
      AIM: The study's aim was to describe RNs' experience of providing palliative care
      for older people in a municipal context. Data were collected through focus group 
      discussions with 20 RNs from four different municipalities in southern Sweden and
      were analysed using conventional content analysis. FINDINGS: The results showed
      that the nurses experienced that it was they who cushioned the effects of unclear
      responsibilities between different organizations, but had limited legitimacy in
      the municipal context and in relation to other care providers. The results also
      showed that nurses lacked proper support and prerequisites for providing
      high-quality palliative care to older dying patients. CONCLUSION: The results
      pinpoint the importance of increased acknowledgement of nurses' knowledge and
      skills and a critical view on the effects of moving towards an organization
      composed of different consultants, which can lead to even more unclear
      responsibility for nursing care provision.

TI  - Diagnostic tests for the detection of human papillomavirus-associated cervical
      lesions.
PG  - 1358-70
AB  - Current diagnostic approaches for primary cervical cancer screening, work-up of
      equivocal or positive screening results or follow- up after treatment of
      precancerous lesions primarily rely on the morphologic interpretation of squamous
      epithelial cells (Pap cytology), in some setting accompanied by the detection of 
      human papillomavirus DNA and have largely contributed to remarkable reduction of 
      disease incidence in countries with implemented screening programs. However,
      these approaches are limited by a poor sensitivity and reproducibility of Pap
      cytology and low specificity for high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of
      HPV DNA detection assays. Early detection might be improved by complementing or
      even replacing these tests by markers which are more directly related to
      molecular events triggering HPV-induced carcinogenesis and thereby might deliver 
      more accurate diagnostic performance. The delineation of molecular changes which 
      occur during different stages of HPV infections and the identification of changes
      which induce neoplastic alterations allow for the detection of markers that
      specifically highlight the transforming stage of the infection where viral
      oncogenes are overexpressed and therefore allow for a more specific diagnosis of 
      lesions that require treatment. The evaluation of such markers in clinical
      studies revealed that some indeed show an improved diagnostic performance
      compared to Pap cytology or HPV DNA tests only.

PG  - 1371-8
AB  - Cervical cancer is a major health problem and almost all of these cancers are
      related to a high risk Human Papillomavirus cervical infection. The Human
      Papillomavirus transforming potential has long been probed and is mainly
      characterized by the integration of the virus in the host genomes and the
      expression of the viral oncoproteins such as the E6 and E7 mRNAs. The vast
      majority of the HPV infections are transient and resolve and just a few
      percentages of patients are noted to develop a persistent infection. Therefore,
      there is the need of identifying appropriate biomarkers that can predict and
      differentiate transient vs persistent and clinical relevant HPV cervical
      infections. To date, two categories of commercial assays have been introduced,
      mainly aiming to the detection of the E6 and E7 mRNAs and of the surrogates of
      the E7 activity (p16ink4A protein). The aim of the present study is to analyse
      the basis of the HPV-related carcinogenesis and to discuss the commercial
      biomarkers developed to-date, reviewing those studies that used the
      above-mentioned assays in a clinical setting.

AB  - Cervical cancer is the second most common malignancy among women worldwide. While
      more than 90% of cervical cancers carry one or more high risk HPV types, the
      exact relationship between HPV oncoproteins and signaling pathways alterations in
      cervical cancer remains to be clarified. Vaccines and targeted therapies are
      today considered of great potential for the improvement of patients' outcome.
      This review will focus on the interaction of HPV with cervical cancer pathway

      and protein profiling as well as innovative logistics, necessary for the
      implementation of the personalized care of cervical cancer patients will be
      discussed.

TI  - Liquid-based cytology with HPV triage of low-grade cytological abnormalities
      versus conventional cytology in cervical cancer screening.
PG  - 1406-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Liquid-based cytology with supplementary human papillomavirus triage
      (LBC+HPV triage) of low-grade cytological abnormalities may improve the detection
      of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) compared with conventional cytology. 
      To investigate this subject, LBC+HPV triage and conventional cytology were
      alternated in a population-based screening setting. Cases with abnormal cytology 
      were referred for colposcopy. METHODS: We compared the performance of LBC+HPV
      triage [n=4059] and conventional cytology [n=4261] in detecting CIN2 or worse
      [CIN2+] and CIN3 or worse [CIN3+]. We used logistic regression to assess CIN
      detection rates and abnormal cytology rates, which yielded unadjusted odds ratios
      (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). We computed adjusted ORs
      from a multivariate logistic regression model that included potential confounders
      such as age, screening centre and time period. RESULTS: We found similar
      detection rates of CIN2+ by LBC+HPV triage and conventional cytology; the
      adjusted OR for the comparison of CIN detection rates was 0.87 (95% CI:
      0.60-1.26) for CIN2+ and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.64-1.58) for CIN3+. We also found
      similar positive predictive values between methods. Thus, there was no advantage 
      in using LBC+HPV triage as compared to conventional cytology in terms of
      sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value to detect
      histologically confirmed CIN2+ and CIN3+. CONCLUSIONS: LBC+HPV triage may lead to
      a reduction in unnecessary work-ups for women with abnormal cytological lesions
      who are negative for high-risk HPV. It is important to continuously monitor
      abnormal cytology rates, both when testing a new method, and after the new method
      has become routine.

AB  - Cervical cancer (CC) is caused by a persistent infection by certain human
      papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes. Although Papanicolaou (Pap) Test is considered
      the most cost-effective test for reducing CC mortality, a considerable number of 
      high-grade precursor lesions of CC could pass unnoticed with the Pap. The
      addition of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype detection in cervical
      cytology has improved the sensitivity, but due to its low specificity, further
      biomarkers of malignancy have been searched for. Given the fact that the
      oncogenic role of HPV is exerted primarily by affecting cell cycle control it is 
      not surprising that most of the useful biomarkers of HPV-related uterine lesions 
      are cell cycle proteins, with p16 and Ki67 the most widely used. More recently,
      molecular profiling and marker combination tests have identified the utility of
      antibody cocktails such as p16/Ki67 dual and ProEx C, which detect both TOP2A and
      MCM2 cell cycle proteins. In this article we revise the rationale for the use of 
      the most common cell cycle biomarkers, also including p53 and cyclin D1, and
      their clinical utility drawing attention to novel biomarkers and how HPV
      vaccination could influence their use.

AB  - Invasive cervical cancer is a common problem worldwide and while rates of
      squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix (SCC) have been declining with the
      implementation of community screening programs, adenocarcinoma of the cervix
      (ADC) has not shown a similar response to screening. At this time, the two
      entities are tested for and treated with the same clinical algorithms, namely
      gynecologic cytology and molecular testing for HPV DNA. However, ADC arises more 
      proximally within the cervical canal and frequently occurs below the superficial 
      mucosal lining, precluding it from being easily diagnosed with cytologic
      examination. Furthermore, ADC has a more aggressive course than SCC and is
      significantly less responsive to radiotherapy. These factors combine to produce a
      lesion that is diagnosed at a higher stage and has an overall poorer prognosis
      than SCC. While both lesions have pathogenic origins with the high-risk species
      of Human papilloma viruses (HPV), the high association of ADC with HPV 18, a
      virus with a higher genome integration rate, suggests that the transformation
      pathway of ADC differs from SCC. Modern methods of molecular analysis can produce
      gene expression profiles of various cell types and preliminary studies have shown
      that SCC and ADC do, indeed, produce a distinct genetic signature and can be
      reproducibly segregated. This technology has promise for clinical applicability
      in the diagnosis, the prognostic stratification, formation of a treatment care
      plan and post-therapeutic monitoring of ADC.

TI  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines as an option for preventing cervical
      malignancies: (how) effective and safe?
PG  - 1466-87
AB  - We carried out a systematic review of HPV vaccine pre- and post-licensure trials 
      to assess the evidence of their effectiveness and safety. We find that HPV
      vaccine clinical trials design, and data interpretation of both efficacy and
      safety outcomes, were largely inadequate. Additionally, we note evidence of
      selective reporting of results from clinical trials (i.e., exclusion of vaccine
      efficacy figures related to study subgroups in which efficacy might be lower or
      even negative from peer-reviewed publications). Given this, the widespread
      optimism regarding HPV vaccines long-term benefits appears to rest on a number of
      unproven assumptions (or such which are at odd with factual evidence) and
      significant misinterpretation of available data. For example, the claim that HPV 
      vaccination will result in approximately 70% reduction of cervical cancers is
      made despite the fact that the clinical trials data have not demonstrated to date
      that the vaccines have actually prevented a single case of cervical cancer (let
      alone cervical cancer death), nor that the current overly optimistic surrogate
      marker-based extrapolations are justified. Likewise, the notion that HPV vaccines
      have an impressive safety profile is only supported by highly flawed design of
      safety trials and is contrary to accumulating evidence from vaccine safety
      surveillance databases and case reports which continue to link HPV vaccination to
      serious adverse outcomes (including death and permanent disabilities). We thus
      conclude that further reduction of cervical cancers might be best achieved by
      optimizing cervical screening (which carries no such risks) and targeting other
      factors of the disease rather than by the reliance on vaccines with questionable 
      efficacy and safety profiles.

PG  - 1490-7
AB  - The identification of HPV as the cause of cervical cancer has changed the
      information required for surveillance. HPV prevalence and screening uptake
      worldwide are now necessary to describe the epidemiology of this cancer. In
      low-income countries cervical cancer incidence varies from low to very high
      levels and is strongly influenced by virus prevalence. In high-income countries, 
      instead, incidence is low and little influenced by the virus prevalence, thanks
      to screening. The European Guidelines currently recommend Pap test every 3-5
      years starting at age 22-30 and stopping at age 60-65. HPV testing is now limited
      to triage of borderline lesions? and to post-CIN follow up. Pilot studies
      evaluating HPV testing as primary test are recommended. Future governmental
      agency Guidelines in Europe will probably include HPV testing as viable for
      primary screening, with cytology triage for HPV-positive women (those positive to
      cytology will be directly referred to colposcopy, those negative will repeat HPV 
      at one year. Persistence of HPV positivity will refer to colposcopy directly,
      clearance to regular screening). The interval after an HPV-negative test should
      be at least 5 years and starting age should be age 30/35. Pap test is still
      recommended for women under 30.

AB  - Persistent infection of High Risk (HR) Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection can
      lead to cervical cancer. The HPV genotypes are found worldwide, but important
      regional variations have been found. For a population-based HPV type prevalence
      study to assess the effect of existing and new prevention methods, frequently
      updated information on the burden of cervical cancer is essential. We evaluated
      the prevalence of HPV genotypes in a volunteer population screened for cervical
      cancer at the Local Health Unit (LHU) of Lecce. A total of 9,720 women were
      studied. The tests were performed by INNO-Lipa HPV Genotyping and LINEAR ARRAY
      HPV Genotyping Test. The overall HPV prevalence was 29.7% (95% CI, 28.8-30.6) for
      any HPV DNA. The prevalent type for all age groups was HPV 16 (7.4%; CI, 6.9-7.9)
      followed by HPV 31 (3.4%; CI, 3.0-3.7), 51 (3.0%; CI, 2.6-3.3), 52 (2.7%; CI,
      2.3-3.0) and 58 (2.4%; CI, 2.1-2.7). HPV 53 was the most common low-risk HPV type
      with prevalence rate of 3.5 (CI, 3.1-3.8), followed by HPV 66 (3.0; CI, 2.6-3.3),
      6 (2.9; CI, 2.6-3.2) and 42 (2.5; CI, 2.2-2.8). Multiple infections were present 
      in 13.6% of HPV-tested women (CI, 12.9-14.3). Among these, the most common
      combination was of HPV 16 and HPV 52 genotypes. This study reports high
      prevalence of HPV infection and may serve as a valuable reference for assessing
      the impact of HPV vaccination programs. Furthermore, it supports the need for new
      vaccines that contain the most common HPV genotypes present in the population.

LID - 10.1186/1472-6963-12-342 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Older adults receive most of their end-of-life care in the community,
      but there are few published data to guide researchers on recruitment to studies
      in primary care. The aim of this study was to compare recruitment of patients and
      bereaved carers from general practices in areas with different research network
      support, and identify challenges in obtaining samples representative of those in 
      need of end-of-life care. METHODS: Comparative analysis of recruitment from
      general practices to two face-to-face interview studies concerned with 1) carers'
      perceptions of transitions between settings for decedents aged over 75 years and 
      2) the experiences of older patients living with cancer at the end-of-life.
      RESULTS: 33 (15% of invitees) patients and 118 (25%) carers were interviewed.
      Carers from disadvantaged areas were under-represented. Recruitment was higher
      when researchers, rather than research network staff, were in direct contact with
      general practices. Most practices recruited no more than one carer, despite a
      seven fold difference in the number of registered patients. The proportion
      identified as eligible for patient interviews varied by a factor of 38 between
      practices. Forty-four Primary Care Trusts granted approval to interview carers;
      two refused. One gave no reason; a second did not believe that general
      practitioners would be able to identify carers. CONCLUSION: Obtaining a
      representative sample of patients or carers in end-of-life research is a resource
      intensive challenge. Review of the regulatory and organisational barriers to
      end-of-life researchers in primary care is required. Research support networks
      provide invaluable assistance, but researchers should ensure that they are alert 
      to the ways in which they may influence study recruitment.

AB  - Inhibition of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) is a promising approach for the
      therapeutic treatment of cancer and other diseases. In this work, we review the
      recent progress on the molecular modeling and virtual screening toward the
      identification of key structural features associated with the enzyme inhibitory
      action of active compounds and to identify DNMT inhibitors with novel molecular
      scaffolds. We discuss the molecular modeling with the co-factor binding site
      using a recent crystallographic structure of the methyltransferase domain of
      human DNMT1. We also review the emerging synergy of molecular modeling and
      chemoinformatic approaches applied to epigenetic therapies targeting DNMTs.

      relevance, structural data and drug discovery perspectives.
PG  - 578-613
AB  - Research on cancer epigenetics has flourished in the last decade. Nevertheless
      growing evidence point on the importance to understand the mechanisms by which
      epigenetic changes regulate the genesis and progression of cancer growth. Several
      epigenetic targets have been discovered and are currently under validation for
      new anticancer therapies. Drug discovery approaches aiming to target these
      epigenetic enzymes with small-molecules inhibitors have produced the first
      pre-clinical and clinical outcomes and many other compounds are now entering the 
      pipeline as new candidate epidrugs. The most studied targets can be ascribed to
      histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases, although several other classes
      of enzymes are able to operate post-translational modifications to histone tails 
      are also likely to represent new frontiers for therapeutic interventions. By
      acknowledging that the field of cancer epigenetics is evolving with an impressive
      rate of new findings, with this review we aim to provide a current overview of
      pre-clinical applications of smallmolecules for cancer pathologies, combining
      them with the current knowledge of epigenetic targets in terms of available
      structural data and drug design perspectives.

TI  - Anti-cancer drug development: computational strategies to identify and target
      proteins involved in cancer metabolism.
PG  - 532-77
AB  - Cancer remains a fundamental burden to public health despite substantial efforts 
      aimed at developing effective chemotherapeutics and significant advances in
      chemotherapeutic regimens. The major challenge in anti-cancer drug design is to
      selectively target cancer cells with high specificity. Research into treating
      malignancies by targeting altered metabolism in cancer cells is supported by
      computational approaches, which can take a leading role in identifying candidate 
      targets for anti-cancer therapy as well as assist in the discovery and
      optimisation of anti-cancer agents. Natural products appear to have privileged
      structures for anti-cancer drug development and the bulk of this particularly
      valuable chemical space still remains to be explored. In this review we aim to
      provide a comprehensive overview of current strategies for computer-guided
      anti-cancer drug development. We start with a discussion of state-of-the art
      bioinformatics methods applied to the identification of novel anti-cancer
      targets, including machine learning techniques, the Connectivity Map and
      biological network analysis. This is followed by an extensive survey of molecular
      modelling and cheminformatics techniques employed to develop agents targeting
      proteins involved in the glycolytic, lipid, NAD+, mitochondrial (TCA cycle),
      amino acid and nucleic acid metabolism of cancer cells. A dedicated section
      highlights the most promising strategies to develop anti-cancer therapeutics from
      natural products and the role of metabolism and some of the many targets which
      are under investigation are reviewed. Recent success stories are reported for all
      the areas covered in this review. We conclude with a brief summary of the most
      interesting strategies identified and with an outlook on future directions in
      anti-cancer drug development.

TI  - Exploring patterns of epigenetic information with data mining techniques.
PG  - 779-89
AB  - Data mining, a part of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases process (KDD), is the
      process of extracting patterns from large data sets by combining methods from
      statistics and artificial intelligence with database management. Analyses of
      epigenetic data have evolved towards genome-wide and high-throughput approaches, 
      thus generating great amounts of data for which data mining is essential. Part of
      these data may contain patterns of epigenetic information which are mitotically
      and/or meiotically heritable determining gene expression and cellular
      differentiation, as well as cellular fate. Epigenetic lesions and genetic
      mutations are acquired by individuals during their life and accumulate with
      ageing. Both defects, either together or individually, can result in losing
      control over cell growth and, thus, causing cancer development. Data mining
      techniques could be then used to extract the previous patterns. This work reviews
      some of the most important applications of data mining to epigenetics.

TI  - microRNA biogenesis pathway as a therapeutic target for human disease and cancer.
PG  - 745-64
AB  - The deregulation of microRNAs expression and activity is frequently observed in a
      wide variety of human pathologies including cancer. Accordingly, growing evidence
      indicates that the targeting of microRNAs biogenesis and pathways is emerging as 
      a central tool for the development of novel RNA-based drugs and therapies to
      defeat diseases in humans. In this review we describe the various strategies that
      can be used to target microRNAs and specific RNA-binding proteins, involved in
      the regulation of their production, localization, stability and activity, in
      human cancer and cardiovascular diseases. We also focus on the efforts that are
      currently made to enhance the potency and stability of these therapeutic agents
      and their delivery to modulate in vivo microRNAs pathways. Finally, we present
      structural data on proteins that belong to the microRNA pathway for small
      molecules-based target therapy design.

TI  - Rejuvenating sirtuins: the rise of a new family of cancer drug targets.
PG  - 614-23
AB  - Sirtuins are a family of NAD+-dependent enzymes that was proposed to control
      organismal life span about a decade ago. While such role of sirtuins is now
      debated, mounting evidence involves these enzymes in numerous physiological
      processes and disease conditions, including metabolism, nutritional behavior,
      circadian rhythm, but also inflammation and cancer. SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3, SIRT6,
      and SIRT7 have all been linked to carcinogenesis either as tumor suppressor or as
      cancer promoting proteins. Here, we review the biological rationale for the
      search of sirtuin inhibitors and activators for treating cancer and the
      experimental approaches to their identification.

TI  - ADP-ribosylated proteins as old and new drug targets for anticancer therapy: the 
      example of ARF6.
PG  - 624-33
AB  - Post-translational modifications of cellular proteins by mono- or
      poly-ADP-ribosylation are associated with numerous cellular processes.
      ADP-ribosylation reactions are important in the nucleus, and in mitochondrial
      activity, stress response signaling, intracellular trafficking, and cell
      senescence and apoptosis decisions. These reversible reactions add ADP-ribose to 
      target proteins via specific enzymes to form the ADP-ribosylated protein; the
      cleaveage of this covalent bond is performed via hydrolases. Deficiencies in
      these enzymatic activities lead to cell death or tumor formation, thus defining
      their functional roles and impact on human disease. Unlike mono-
      ADP-ribosyltransferases, poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) have been at the
      frontline of drug discovery since the 1980s. PARP1 is a valuable therapeutic
      target, with a central role in responses to DNA damage. With
      mono-ADP-ribosylation now linked to human diseases, such as inflammation,
      diabetes, neurodegeneration and cancer metastasis, novel and equally important
      functions of mono-ADPribosylation in cell signaling pathways can now be defined. 
      Recently, we reported mono-ADP-ribosylation of ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), 
      a small G-protein of the Ras superfamily. In addition to its involvement in actin
      remodeling, plasma membrane reorganization and vesicular transport, ARF6
      contributes to cancer progression through activation of cell motility and
      invasion. Consequently, targeting this modification will counteract the
      pro-invasive effects of ARF6, providing innovative anti-tumor therapy. This
      review summarizes our present knowledge of the enzymes and targets involved in
      ADP-ribosylation reactions, and describes in silico approaches to visualize their
      site of interaction and to identify the precise site for ADP-ribosylation. This
      should ultimately improve pharmacological strategies to enhance both anti-tumor
      efficacy and treatment of a number of inflammatory and neurodegenerative
      disorders.

TI  - Immunoproteasome in cancer and neuropathologies: a new therapeutic target?
PG  - 702-18
AB  - Immunoproteasome is an emerging biological target that constitutes a key element 
      not only in antigen presentation but also in T cell and cytokine regulation as
      well as cellular homeostasis. Respect to standard proteasome, the inducible
      expression and different sensitivity towards activity modulators of
      immunoproteasome render it a potential therapeutic target for tumours and central
      nervous system diseases. In this review we report the cutting edge studies for
      understanding when immunoproteasome expression is induced and how it regulates
      pivotal pathways involved in tumours and neuropathologies, including apoptosis
      and inflammation. We emphasize its role as a new pharmacological target by
      describing the recent medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at design selective
      small-molecule modulators of both standard- and immuno-proteasome forms. Finally,
      we also present an in silico model of the human immunoproteasome structure by the
      major molecular differences with the 20S standard proteasome and discuss the
      perspective for the design of novel specific smallmolecule modulators for the

TI  - Accessing cancer metabolic pathways by the use of microarray technology.
PG  - 790-805
AB  - Cancer metabolism is currently re-evaluated by the research community with the
      aim to investigate possible opportunities for the development of targeted
      therapies. Firstly discovered by Warburg et al. in the beginning of the last
      century, it is now a widely accepted hypothesis that cancer cells possess a
      severely deregulated form of glycolysis also under aerobic conditions.
      Accompanied by a deregulated glycolysis is an increasing dependence on glucose
      and glutamine, this characteristic offers a striking opportunity for new kinds of
      anti-cancer drugs. A feasible approach in this endeavour is the combined use of
      metabolic and transcriptomic information. Microarrays provide nowadays a reliable
      way for accessing the transcriptomic layer, even higher layers of biological
      information are in the scope. In this review we present the possibilities and
      also the limitations of this technique starting from the early phase of the
      microarray to the modern concepts of bioinformatics and systems biology. By
      highlighting also clinicopathological possibilities it is demonstrated that
      microarray technology is able to integrate various layers of biological
      information. Case studies incorporating aspects of cancer metabolism into therapy
      relevant applications and some potential new targets of cancer metabolism for
      novel cancer therapies are pointed out. These new cancer therapies can lead to
      the establishment of personalized medicine by use of custom based microarray
      platforms introducing treatment options in clinical decision making.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitors.
PG  - 687-701
AB  - Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) play an important role in embryonic
      development, angiogenesis, wound healing, cell proliferation and differentiation.
      The fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) isoforms have been under intense
      scrutiny for effective anticancer drug candidates. The fibroblast growth factor
      (FGF) and its receptor (FGFR) provide another pathway that seems critical to
      monitoring angiogenesis. Recent findings suggest that FGFR mediates signaling,
      regulates the PKM2 activity, and plays a crucial role in cancer metabolism. The
      current review also covers the recent findings on the role of FGFR1 in cancer
      metabolism. This paper reviews the progress, mechanism, and binding modes of
      recently known kinase inhibitors such as PD173074, SU series and other inhibitors
      still under clinical development. Some of the structural classes that will be
      highlighted in this review include Pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines, Indolin- 2-one,
      Pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine, Pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one, and 1,6-
      Naphthyridin-2(1H)-ones.

TI  - Colorectal cancer microenvironment: among nutrition, gut microbiota, inflammation
      and epigenetics.
PG  - 765-78
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major health problem causing significant morbidity
      and mortality. During the last decade, results from different studies indicate
      that the pathogenetic mechanisms of CRC encompass tumour microenvironment,
      emphasizing a tight correlation with aging, inflammation, nutrition, gut
      microbiome composition and epigenetic modifications. Aging is one of the most
      important risk factors for the development of a wide range of neoplasies,
      including CRC, as it represents the general framework in which the tumor
      environment evolves. Together, these elements likely contribute to the
      carcinogenic process with specific effects, impacts and roles in the different
      stages of the tumor progression. CRCs evolve through loops of deregulated
      inflammatory stimuli which are sustained by DNA damage signaling pathways,
      dysbiosis of gut microbiota (GM) and epigenetic re-modelling (DNA methylation).
      To date no studies address those elements simultaneously. The synergic analysis
      of such parameters could provide new biological insights and effective biomarkers
      that could have applications in prevention, molecular diagnosis, prognosis and
      treatment of CRC.

TI  - Novel HSP90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922 enhances the anti-tumor effect of temsirolimus
      against oral squamous cell carcinoma.
PG  - 289-99
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTOR) are involved in the molecular pathogenesis of advanced oral
      squamous cell carcinoma. HSP90 inhibitors are capable of effectively interfering 
      with multiple signaling pathways, including the mTOR signaling pathway. However, 
      the combined effects of HSP90 and mTOR inhibitors on oral squamous cell carcinoma
      are still unknown. In this study, we investigated the dual treatment of the novel
      HSP90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922 and temsirolimus against oral squamous cell carcinoma.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of the combination of NVP-AUY922 and
      temsirolimus on oral squamous cell carcinoma in vitro and in vivo was determined 
      by MTS assay and mouse xenograft models. The effect of the combination on
      angiogenesis was determined by tube formation assay and angioreactor. RESULTS:
      The combination treatment of NVP-AUY922 and temsirolimus significantly inhibited 
      the proliferation of SAS oral squamous cell carcinoma cells in vitro and
      suppressed the growth of oral squamous cell carcinoma xenografts in vivo. We have
      clearly shown that the combination treatment of NVP-AUY922 and temsirolimus
      inhibited vascular formation both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the combination
      treatment of NVP-AUY922 and temsirolimus prolonged the survival rate in mice
      xenografted with oral squamous cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we showed the
      activity of a combination of mTOR and HSP90 inhibitors for the treatment of
      advanced oral squamous carcinoma.

TI  - Targeting tyrosine kinase receptors in hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 300-12
AB  - The recent discoveries of genomic and molecular markers in hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) have improved the understanding about the complexity of the
      signal transduction pathways as well as their relevance in normal and liver
      cancer cells. The identification of the functional repercussions of punctual
      mutations and crosstalk among cell signaling will promote the identification of
      specific combinatorial targeted molecular therapies to specific subsets of
      patients which will allow the development of personalized-based therapy and
      increase the survival of patients. Numerous molecular targets are in the
      cross-road between oncogenic and anti-apoptotic programs, genetic or epigenetic
      alterations, which overall may have a similar cellular phenotype. The standard
      antineoplastic chemotherapeutic regimes based on cytotoxic agents leads to
      significant side effect and modest response rates, marginal changes in natural
      history, and toxicities that may impact the quality of life of patients.
      Different strategies involving gene therapy, targeted antibodies or small
      molecules have been used to regulate cell death/proliferation signals, as well as
      angiogenesis in liver tumors. In this sense, Sorafenib recently approved for
      renal cell carcinoma, represents the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
      licensed for the treatment of patients with advanced HCC. This review summarizes 
      the current status of molecular receptor TKI-based targeted therapy in HCC
      driving different pathways involved in cell survival, proliferation, migration,
      angiogenesis and metastasis, which include the regulation of Raf/MEK/ERK,
      PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and Jak/STAT cell signaling. The study also provides information
      about cell signaling crosstalk relevant in tyrosine kinase receptors (TKR)-based 
      systemic therapy in HCC.

TI  - The preoperative sexual functioning and quality of sexual life in colorectal
      cancer: a study among patients and their partners.
PG  - 3247-54
LID - 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2012.02938.x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Even though the body of literature on sexual functioning is
      growing, information on the preoperative sexual functioning and the quality of
      sexual life after colorectal cancer is lacking. Research focusing on female
      patients and on partners is also rather scarce. AIM: This cross-sectional study
      aimed to describe the preoperative sexual functioning, quality of sexual life,
      and relationship functioning for male and female colorectal cancer patients and
      their partners. In addition, the mean scores of the patients and partners were
      compared with mean norm scores. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with colorectal
      cancer (N = 136) and their partners (N = 106) were recruited before surgical
      treatment in six Dutch hospitals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Men completed the
      International Index of Erectile Functioning, while women completed the Female
      Sexual Function Index. All partnered participants completed the Golombok-Rust
      Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction and the Maudsley Marital Questionnaire. The mean
      scores were compared with mean norm scores derived from the manuals of the
      questionnaires. RESULTS: All participants were in a heterosexual relationship.
      Female patients reported a lower quality of sexual life compared with male
      patients. Male partners reported a lower sexual functioning and a lower quality
      of sexual life compared with male patients. Colorectal cancer patients and
      partners (both sexes) reported a lower sexual functioning and a lower quality of 
      sexual life compared with norm populations but scored similar on relationship
      functioning. CONCLUSION: A lower sexual functioning and a lower quality of sexual
      life are already reported preoperatively; however, relationship functioning was
      comparable with a norm population. Therefore, all the impairment seen after
      treatment should not be solely attributed to the effects of treatment.

TI  - The utility of hyperthermia for local recurrence of breast cancer.
PG  - 201
LID - 10.1186/1477-7819-10-201 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperthermia has long been used in combination with chemotherapy or
      radiation therapy for the treatment of superficial malignancies, in part due to
      its sensitizing capabilities. Patients who suffer from superficial recurrences of
      breast cancer have poor clinical outcomes. Skin metastases may particularly
      impair the quality of life due to the physical appearance, odor and bleeding.
      CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old woman underwent mastectomy and axillary lymph
      node dissection for breast cancer. Nine years post-operatively, local metastases 
      developed in the left axillary area (measuring 5 cm in diameter). Initially the
      tumor did not respond to radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Therefore, we added 
      hyperthermia combined with them. Eight weeks later, the tumor became nearly flat 
      and the patient noted improved activity in her daily life. CONCLUSION:
      Hyperthermia may accelerate the antitumor effects of radiation therapy and
      chemotherapy. This treatment provides an alternative for unresectable breast
      cancer skin metastases.

TI  - Radiosensitization by the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat under hypoxia 
      and with capecitabine in experimental colorectal carcinoma.
PG  - 165
LID - 10.1186/1748-717X-7-165 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat is a candidate
      radiosensitizer in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Radiosensitivity is
      critically influenced by hypoxia; hence, it is important to evaluate the efficacy
      of potential radiosensitizers under variable tissue oxygenation. Since
      fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the only clinically validated
      regimen in LARC, efficacy in combination with this established regimen should be 
      assessed in preclinical models before a candidate drug enters clinical trials.
      METHODS: Radiosensitization by vorinostat under hypoxia was studied in four
      colorectal carcinoma cell lines and in one colorectal carcinoma xenograft model
      by analysis of clonogenic survival and tumor growth delay, respectively.
      Radiosensitizing effects of vorinostat in combination with capecitabine were
      assessed by evaluation of tumor growth delay in two colorectal carcinoma
      xenografts models. RESULTS: Under hypoxia, radiosensitization by vorinostat was
      demonstrated in vitro in terms of decreased clonogenicity and in vivo as
      inhibition of tumor growth. Adding vorinostat to capecitabine-based CRT increased
      radiosensitivity of xenografts in terms of inhibited tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS:
      Vorinostat sensitized colorectal carcinoma cells to radiation under hypoxia in
      vitro and in vivo and improved therapeutic efficacy in combination with
      capecitabine-based CRT in vivo. The results encourage implementation of
      vorinostat into CRT in LARC trials.

TI  - Statin use and the risk of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after
      definitive local therapy: a meta-analysis of eight cohort studies.
PG  - E71-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2012.11527.x [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Over the
      last few years, several observational studies examined the association of statin 
      use with the risk of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after definitive
      local therapy. The objective of our present study was to summarise available
      evidence on this subject using the method of meta-analysis. Combined evidence
      from eight cohort studies did not definitively support the hypothesis that
      statins influence the risk of biochemical recurrence. However, there was
      considerable disagreement between individual studies in reported findings and
      conclusions. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of
      clinical studies with statin use as the exposure variable and biochemical
      recurrence after definitive local therapy for prostate cancer as the outcome.
      METHODS: Relevant publications were identified through PubMed/Medline/Embase
      databases. Pooled estimates of the hazard ratios (HRs) were computed using the
      inverse-variance weighting approach. Heterogeneity was assessed using the
      Cochran's Q test. RESULTS: We identified a total of eight eligible studies, all
      based on the retrospective cohort design. Five of these were based on radical
      prostatectomy (RP) series and three on radiotherapy (RT) series. There was
      evidence of heterogeneity in the entire set of eight studies (P = 0.002) as well 
      as in the RP series (P = 0.05) and in the RT series (P = 0.01), when these were
      considered separately. Based on the random effects inverse-variance weighting
      approach, pooled estimates of the HRs for the risk of biochemical recurrence in
      statin users v non-users were 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72-1.13) for
      the entire set of eight studies, 1.02 (95% CI 0.80-1.29) for the RP series and
      0.71 (95% CI 0.44-1.16) for the RT series. CONCLUSION: The pooled estimates of
      the HRs were not significantly different from the null value in this
      meta-analysis; however, evidence of heterogeneity between the studies was
      present.

AB  - Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSC) are immature myeloid cells that are
      potent inhibitors of immune cell function and which accumulate under conditions
      of inflammation, especially cancer. MDSC are suggested to promote the growth of
      cancer by both enhancement of tumor angiogenesis and metastasis and also
      inhibition of antitumor immune responses. The presence of deficient and/or
      defective antitumor adaptive and innate immune responses, coincident with
      accumulation of MDSC in lymphoid organs and tumor parenchyma, supports the notion
      of a causal relationship. The potent ability of MDSC to inhibit several
      components and phases of immune response highlights the likelihood that targeting
      the inhibitory functions of MDSC may maximize the therapeutic potential of
      antitumor immunotherapy. In order to guide the rational development of
      immunotherapeutic strategies that incorporate inhibition of MDSC activity and
      enzymatic functions, thorough understanding of the role of MDSC in antitumor
      immune responses is required. In this manuscript we review the multifaceted
      inhibitory functions of MDSC and consider the role of MDSC-induced inhibition of 
      antitumor T cell effector phase. Support for this research is from NIH R01
      CA108573.

AB  - Patients with cancer have an impaired T cell response that can decrease the
      potential therapeutic benefit of cancer vaccines and other forms of
      immunotherapy. The establishment of a chronic inflammatory environment in
      patients with cancer plays a critical role in the induction of T cell
      dysfunction. The accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in tumor
      bearing hosts is a hallmark of malignancy-associated inflammation and a major
      mediator of the induction of T cell suppression in cancer. Recent findings in
      tumor bearing mice and cancer patients indicate that the increased metabolism of 
      L-Arginine (L-Arg) by MDSC producing Arginase I inhibits T cell lymphocyte
      responses. Here, we discuss some of the most recent concepts of how MDSC
      expressing Arginase I may regulate T cell function in cancer and suggest possible
      therapeutic interventions to overcome this inhibitory effect.

AB  - Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were initially reported as suppressor of
      the adaptive immune responses against cancer and other diseases. However,
      emerging evidence suggest that MDSCs may also support anti-tumor immune responses
      under certain conditions or may inhibit tumor growth. In the present mini-review,
      we suggest that such opposing functions of MDSCs are due to phenotypic plasticity
      of the myeloid cells, allowing them to produce a diverse form of morphology,
      physiological state, and function in response to environmental conditions.
      Therefore, they can be manipulated by means of immune modulators to overcome
      their immune suppressive function.

LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-12-434 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nucleoside analogs used in the chemotherapy of solid tumors, such as 
      the capecitabine catabolite 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5'-DFUR) trigger a
      transcriptomic response that involves the aquaglyceroporin aquaporin 3 along with
      other p53-dependent genes. Here, we examined whether up-regulation of aquaporin 3
      (AQP3) mRNA in cancer cells treated with 5'-DFUR represents a collateral
      transcriptomic effect of the drug, or conversely, AQP3 participates in the
      activity of genotoxic agents. METHODS: The role of AQP3 in cell volume increase, 
      cytotoxicity and cell cycle arrest was analyzed using loss-of-function
      approaches. RESULTS: 5'-DFUR and gemcitabine, but not cisplatin, stimulated AQP3 
      expression and cell volume, which was partially and significantly blocked by
      knockdown of AQP3. Moreover, AQP3 siRNA significantly blocked other effects of
      nucleoside analogs, including G1/S cell cycle arrest, p21 and FAS up-regulation, 
      and cell growth inhibition. Short incubations with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) also
      induced AQP3 expression and increased cell volume, and the inhibition of AQP3
      expression significantly blocked growth inhibition triggered by this drug. To
      further establish whether AQP3 induction is related to cell cycle arrest and
      apoptosis, cells were exposed to long incubations with escalating doses of 5-FU. 
      AQP3 was highly up-regulated at doses associated with cell cycle arrest, whereas 
      at doses promoting apoptosis induction of AQP3 mRNA expression was reduced.
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, we propose that the aquaglyceroporin AQP3 is
      required for cytotoxic activity of 5'-DFUR and gemcitabine in the breast cancer
      cell line MCF7 and the colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29, and is implicated in 
      cell volume increase and cell cycle arrest.

AB  - UNLABELLED: What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Men
      diagnosed with prostate cancer are increasingly involved in making their own
      treatment decisions and the current recommendations for treatment are based on
      informed choice. The absence of scientific evidence regarding optimum treatment
      choices underlines the importance of understanding which factors influence the
      selection of treatment by men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Previous studies
      have found that men diagnosed with prostate cancer were more likely to choose
      radiation therapy over radical prostatectomy if they were older and had a higher 
      PSA level. This is the first large-scale prospective study conducted outside the 
      USA to quantify the factors associated with treatment decisions for men diagnosed
      with prostate cancer. It found that men who chose surgery were younger, above
      average physical health, and had lower grade cancers on the Gleason scale; men
      who had radiation therapy were older and had reduced physical health, with ADT
      added when men had more advanced disease. About two-thirds of the men said they
      primarily made the decision about treatment themselves, with the remaining men
      either sharing the decision-making process with their doctor or else leaving the 
      decision more or less completely up to their doctor. These results highlight the 
      importance of having quality up-to-date information readily available to guide
      these decisions. OBJECTIVE: * To examine demographic, clinical and
      quality-of-life indicators for the treatments received by men diagnosed with
      prostate cancer in Australia. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: * This prospective trial
      included men diagnosed with prostate cancer (n= 1064, response rate = 82%)
      between 2005 and 2007 in Queensland, Australia, sampled from urologists and
      hospital outpatient clinics. * Data were collected through telephone interviews
      and self-administered questionnaires. * Treatment received was categorized into
      five groups: radical prostatectomy; radiation therapy with neoadjuvant androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT); radiation therapy alone; ADT alone; and monitoring.
      RESULTS: * Sharp contrasts in the choice between radical prostatectomy (47% of
      men) vs radiation therapy with ADT (30%) were evident among age at diagnosis,
      travel time to facilities offering radiation treatment, Gleason score, stage,
      body mass index and physical health. * Men who underwent surgery were younger and
      of above average physical health, and had lower grade cancers; men who underwent 
      radiation therapy were older and less fit. ADT, in both neoadjuvant and
      definitive forms, was administered for high-risk and more advanced disease. *
      Two-thirds (66%) of men stated that they made the final treatment selection
      themselves. CONCLUSIONS: * These results suggest that men's baseline health and
      tumour characteristics influence treatment choices. * Distance from tertiary
      treatment centres also influenced the treatment received and access to specialist
      urologists may play a role. * With most men indicating high levels of decisional 
      control, the importance of having quality up-to-date information readily
      available to guide their decisions cannot be overstated.

TI  - Is Helicobacter pylori the infectious target to prevent gastric cancer? An
      interdisciplinary point of view.
PG  - 340-5
AB  - Gastric carcinogenesis, which may well extend over decades, is characterized by a
      slow stepwise evolution from superficial gastritis to glandular atrophy,
      intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and finally, adenocarcinoma. This sequence
      provides an excellent opportunity for the prevention or early detection of the
      events preceding development of the neoplasm. In 1994, the International Agency
      for Research on Cancer defined Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) as a group I
      carcinogen for gastric cancer (GC). Evidence supporting a causal association has 
      been demonstrated by epidemiological data as well as by experimental animal
      models. A meta-analysis has shown an higher risk (odds ratio: 1.92) of
      progression to GC in infected compare to uninfected subjects, that increased to a
      value > 8 considering the surveys having a follow-up of more than 8 years. A
      crucial question remains whether and when precancerous lesions can reverse after 
      H. pylori eradication. While several prospective studies have cast doubts about
      this reversibility others obtained opposing results. Currently, H. pylori is
      recognized as a necessary but insufficient cause of GC. The most accepted model
      of gastric carcinogenesis provides, like for other cancers, a multifactorial
      pathogenesis, linked with a number of initiators and other continuator agents.
      This review presents a multidisciplinary point of view to approaching the
      relationship between H. pylori infection and GC, focusing on the potential
      benefits of bacterial eradication in slowing down or in inducing regression of
      precancerous lesions.

TI  - Attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors of secondary school adolescents regarding
      protection from sun exposure: a survey in Bangkok, Thailand.
PG  - 200-6
LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0781.2012.00671.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sun protection behavior is a proven intervention for aging skin and
      skin cancer prevention, especially if training on prolonged sun exposure can be
      performed early in life. Despite the fact that there are several study reports
      from multicenters in the West, there are limited data on sun protection in
      tropical countries where the prevalence of sunburn as well as sun protection
      behavior and knowledge are low. In Bangkok, sun protection behavior among
      adolescents is different from the studies performed in the West. Schools are key 
      institutions in encouraging students to prevent themselves from acquiring
      problems of long-time sun exposure. OBJECTIVE: To assess the amount of time
      exposed to the sun, sun protection behavior, attitudes, and knowledge about sun
      exposure protection among secondary school adolescents in Bangkok, Thailand.
      METHODS: This is a nonrandomized, cross-sectional survey. All students from seven
      secondary schools in Bangkok (public/private, male/female/coed) were recruited in
      to the study. RESULTS: A total of 10,387 students were enrolled in to the study; 
      6176 (59.5%) and 4211 (40.5%) students were from grades 7 to 9 and 10 to 12,
      respectively. Male students significantly lacked proper sun-protecting behaviors 
      when compared to the female students in the use of sunscreen (9.4% vs. 28.0%, P <
      0.001), staying under the shade (55.5% vs. 65.2%, P < 0.001), and use of
      umbrellas (5.2% vs. 12.1%, P < 0.001). Proper attitudes and sun-protecting
      behaviors among junior high school students were deficient when compared to high 
      school students in the use of sunscreen (57.1% vs. 60.6%, P < 0.001), types of
      clothing (10.5% vs. 15.3%, P < 0.001), and hat (3.2% vs. 3.9%, P < 0.001).
      CONCLUSION: Sun protection behavior among adolescents in Bangkok was poor
      compared to Western countries. The attitudes and general knowledge about sun
      protection were significantly different among male and female students from
      grades 7 to 9 and 10 to 12. LIMITATION: The limitation of the study is the use of
      self-reported questionnaires in assessing sun exposure and protection.

TI  - Cervical cancer screening in Middle Eastern and Asian migrants to Australia: a
      record linkage study.
PG  - e394-400
LID - 10.1016/j.canep.2012.08.009 [doi]
LID - S1877-7821(12)00118-X [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Australia's organized cervical screening program recommends
      two-yearly screening for women aged 18-69 years and reminder letters are sent at 
      27 months. Cervical screening registers hold comprehensive information on
      screening, but not country of birth. A linkage study was performed in order to
      assess cervical screening behavior in migrants. METHODS: To assess screening
      participation, we linked year 2000 records for 12,541 Middle Eastern/Asian-born
      women 20-54 years of age, and an age and area matched random sample of 12,143
      Australian-born women in the New South Wales (NSW) Midwives Data Collection
      (MDC), which records country of birth, to screening register records. Screening
      behavior after 2000 was assessed in women without a recorded prior cervical
      abnormality. RESULTS: The odds ratios for being screened at least once within a 3
      year period, with reference to Australian-born women and adjusted for age,
      parity, socioeconomic status and smoking, were 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81-0.97) and 0.74 
      (95% CI: 0.70-0.79) in women born in the Middle East and Asia, respectively.
      Screening increased with increasing socioeconomic status (SES), absence of
      smoking and greater parity in Australian-born women but little, if at all, in
      migrant women. In a sensitivity analysis in which hospital admitted patients were
      the source of population samples, some patterns were sufficiently different to
      suggest that selection for illness can affect the strength and direction of
      associations in linked data. CONCLUSION: Migrant women from Asian and
      Middle-eastern countries are less likely than Australian-born women to
      participate in cervical screening at the recommended interval. Their likelihood
      of screening is also less related to socioeconomic status, smoking and parity
      than that in Australian-born women.

AB  - Perinuclear reorganization via phosphorylation of specific serine residues in
      keratin is involved in the deformability of metastatic cancer cells. The level of
      leukotriene B(4) is high in pancreatic cancers. However, the roles of LTB(4) and 
      its cognate receptors in keratin reorganization of pancreatic cancers are not
      known. LTB(4) dose-dependently induced phosphorylation and reorganization of
      Keratin 8 (K8) and these processes were reversed by LY255283 (BLT2 antagonist).
      BLT2 agonists such as Comp A and 15(S)-HETE also induced phosphorylation of
      serine 431 in K8. Moreover, Comp A-induced K8 phosphorylation and reorganization 
      were blocked by LY255283. Gene silencing of BLT2 suppressed Comp A-induced K8
      phosphorylation and reorganization in PANC-1 cells. Over-expression of BLT2
      promoted K8 phosphorylation. Comp A promoted the migration of PANC-1 cells in a
      dose-dependent manner, and LY255283 blocked Comp A-induced migration,
      respectively. PD98059 (ERK inhibitor) suppressed Comp A-induced phosphorylation
      of serine 431 and reorganization of K8. Gene silencing of BLT2 suppressed the
      expression of pERK, and over-expression of BLT2 increased the expression of pERK 
      even without Comp A. Comp A induced the expression of active ERK (pERK) and BLT2.
      These inductions were blocked by PD98059. Comp A decreased PP2A expression and
      hindered the binding of PP2A to the K8, leading to the activation of ERK. PD98059
      suppressed the Comp A-induced migration of PANC-1 cells and BLT2
      over-expression-induced migration of PANC-1 cells. Overall, these results suggest
      that BLT2 is involved in LTB(4)-induced phosphorylation and reorganization
      through ERK activation by PP2A downregulation, leading to increased migration of 
      PANC-1 cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPN) in colorectal
      cancer (CRC) is challenging, with no clear guidance for management. We aimed to
      study whether certain patient and disease based factors can be used to give
      guidance about further investigation, treatment and outcome of these lesions.
      METHODS: Data was collected via a 2-year retrospective case-note review of
      patients discussed at the multi-disciplinary meeting with a confirmed diagnosis
      of CRC and IPN on CT scan. Further studies were identified by a Pubmed search
      with no limitations and a review of references within those papers. Pooled
      analysis was performed where the data was available. RESULTS: Over the two year
      period, 539 new cases of CRC were discussed locally. Of these, 28 (5.2%) were
      found to have IPN. Malignancy was more likely when multiple nodules were detected
      at presentation (p<0.05). Pooled analysis of a further 7 studies was performed
      where data was available. This confirmed the significance of multiple nodules in 
      terms of predicting malignancy (p<0.01) and additionally demonstrated the
      significance of nodal disease (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the
      difficulties of determining the nature of IPN using either patient or tumour
      characteristics. Significant factors appear to be the presence of multiple
      nodules and nodal disease. In such cases we recommend further imaging at time of 
      detection. If absent, we recommend an interval CT scan at six months.

AB  - Three commercially grown native herbs unique to Australia, Tasmannia pepper leaf 
      (Tasmannia lanceolata R. Br., Winteracea; TPL), anise myrtle (Syzygium anisatum
      Vickery, Craven & Biffen, Myrtaceae; AM) and lemon myrtle (Backhousia citriodora 
      F. Muell, Myrtaceae; LM) as well as a reference sample bay leaf (Laurus nobilis
      L., Lauraceae; BL) were examined for potential cytoprotective properties. All
      native herbs exhibited greater cellular antioxidant activity as measured by the
      cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) assay than bay leaf and reduced the hydrogen 
      peroxide (H(2)O(2)) induced death of hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells by
      25-50%. All herb extracts reduced the proliferation of colon (HT-29;
      IC(50)=0.75-1.39mg/ml), stomach (AGS; IC(50)=0.59-1.88mg/ml), bladder (BL13;
      IC(50)=0.56-1.12mg/ml) and liver (HepG2; IC(50)=0.38-1.36mg/ml) cancer cells. No 
      significant reduction of cell viability of non-transformed colon (CCD-18Co;
      IC(50)>2.0mg/ml) and mixed stomach and intestine (Hs 738.St/Int; IC(50)>2.0mg/ml)
      cells was observed. Flow cytometry analysis and the results of the cytokinesis
      block micronucleus cytome (CBMNCyt) assay conducted with respectively,
      promyelocytic leukaemia (HL-60) and colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29) cells suggest an
      increase in apoptosis following treatment with the herb extracts. The occurrence 
      of apoptotic cells coincided with an increase in caspase-3 enzyme activity. The
      results of the CBMNCyt assay suggested no direct DNA damage in colon
      adenocarcinoma (HT-29) cells as a result of treatment with all extracts, applied 
      at final concentrations of 0.5 and 1.0mg/ml.

      cells and induces apoptosis by modulating the AKT/mTOR signalling pathway.

AB  - Pulsatilla koreana has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of
      several diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine if SB365, Pulsatilla
      saponin D isolated from the root of P. koreana inhibits the progression of colon 
      cancer. We found that SB365 strongly suppressed the growth and proliferation of
      colon cancer cells and induced their apoptosis. Also, SB365 showed
      anti-angiogenic activity by decreasing the expression of HIF-1alpha and VEGF.
      These results were confirmed by an in vivo study showing that SB365 significantly
      inhibited tumor growth by the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of
      angiogenesis with stronger anticancer activity than 5-FU. When further examined
      for its anticancer mechanism, SB365 effectively suppressed the AKT/mTOR pathway
      both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our study demonstrated that SB365
      inhibits the AKT/mTOR pathway, leading to the suppression of tumor growth and
      angiogenesis together with induction of apoptosis. Therefore, SB365 is a good
      candidate as a natural product for use in the treatment of colon cancer.

AB  - The goal of this study was to monitor the anti-proliferative activity of
      Rosmarinus officinalis and Salvia officinalis extracts against cancer cells and
      to correlate this activity with their phytochemical profiles using liquid
      chromatography/diode array detection/electrospray ion trap tandem mass
      spectrometry (LC/DAD/ESI-MS(n)). For the quantitative estimation of triterpenic
      acids in the crude extracts an NMR based methodology was used and compared with
      the HPLC measurements, both applied for the first time, for the case of betulinic
      acid. Both extracts exerted cytotoxic activity through dose-dependent impairment 
      of viability and mitochondrial activity of rat insulinoma m5F (RINm5F) cells.
      Decrease of RINm5F viability was mediated by nitric oxide (NO)-induced apoptosis.
      Importantly, these extracts potentiated NO and TNF-alpha release from macrophages
      therefore enhancing their cytocidal action. The rosemary extract developed more
      pronounced antioxidant, cytotoxic and immunomodifying activities, probably due to
      the presence of betulinic acid and a higher concentration of carnosic acid in its
      phytochemical profile.

AB  - PURPOSE: We determined the risk of disease specific mortality in patients with
      primary, low risk, noninvasive (G1pTa) bladder cancer and compared it to disease 
      specific mortality in age and gender matched general populations. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: We identified all patients with primary low risk cancer at our
      institution. We excluded those with adverse pathological features and then
      matched histopathology, pharmacy, hospital episode and Cancer Registry records.
      We reviewed case notes on patients with subsequent muscle invasion (progression) 
      or disease specific mortality. Patients underwent post-resection surveillance and
      treatment using standard regimens. National and regional disease specific
      mortality rates were calculated from appropriate data. RESULTS: A total of 699
      patients met study inclusion criteria. Median followup was 61 months (IQR
      24-105). Of the patients 17 (2.4%) died of bladder cancer, including 13 of 14
      with progression to muscle invasion and 4 of 19 with grade progression to high
      grade, nonmuscle invasive disease. On Cox regression analyses low grade dysplasia
      in the initial resection specimen and tumor weight were associated with disease
      specific mortality (p <0.003). Disease specific mortality in these patients was 5
      times the background rate in matched populations. Limitations of this study
      include its retrospective nature and the low frequency of adverse events.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low risk bladder cancer rarely progress to muscle
      invasion but they are at higher risk for disease specific mortality than the
      general population. Current surveillance regimens appear ineffective for
      detecting progression in time to alter prognosis.

AB  - PURPOSE: Few studies have evaluated changes in erectile function with time before
      and after prostate brachytherapy using the International Index of Erectile
      Function-15, a sensitive, validated tool for assessing male sexual dysfunction.
      In this prospective study we evaluated the natural history of erectile function
      after prostate brachytherapy without supplemental therapy (external beam
      radiotherapy, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors or androgen deprivation therapy)
      using the International Index of Erectile Function-15. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      identified 119 patients who were followed at least 12 months after prostate
      brachytherapy between 2004 and 2010. Sexual and erectile function status were
      assessed before brachytherapy (baseline), and 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months
      postoperatively using the International Index of Erectile Function-15. RESULTS:
      Mean total International Index of Erectile Function-15 score, and scores on the
      erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire and intercourse satisfaction 
      domains 3 months after brachytherapy were significantly lower than at baseline (p
      <0.05). They remained lower until 36 months after prostate brachytherapy.
      Erectile function was maintained 12 months after brachytherapy in 16 of the 48
      men (33.3%) with a baseline erectile function domain score of 11 or greater.
      There was no significant difference in clinical features except the age of
      patients who maintained the erectile function domain score and their counterparts
      12 months after brachytherapy. Multivariate analysis revealed that age 70 years
      or greater was the only predictive factor for deteriorating erectile function
      after brachytherapy (p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate a global decrease
      in all domains of the International Index of Erectile Function-15 score 12 months
      after prostate brachytherapy. Also, patient age may influence the preservation of
      brachytherapy related potency.

AB  - PURPOSE: We determined the clinical and pathological features associated with
      nephrectomy at post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the testis cancer database from 1980 to 
      2007 to identify all patients treated with post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal
      lymph node dissection. Patients with pure seminoma and nongerm cell histology
      were excluded from study. A total of 1,807 patients were identified, of whom 17
      without recorded mass size were excluded from further study. Pathological and
      clinical variables were assessed by bivariate analysis. Multivariate logistic
      regression was used to determine predictors of nephrectomy at post-chemotherapy
      retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. RESULTS: The overall incidence of
      nephrectomy at post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection was 14.8% 
      (265 of 1,790 cases). The incidence of nephrectomy was 17.0%, 18.9%, 13.6% and
      8.0% in 1980 to 1988 (group 1), 1989 to 1997 (group 2), 1998 to 2002 (group 3)
      and 2002 to 2007 (group 4) (p = 0.0001). The nephrectomy rate for tumors less
      than 2, 2 to 5, 5 to 10 and greater than 10 cm was 6.0%, 5.8%, 13.9% and 31.9%,
      respectively (p = 0.0001). The incidence of nephrectomy based on retroperitoneal 
      histology was 10.3% for fibrosis, 14.5% for teratoma and 20.4% for cancer (p =
      0.0001). The strongest predictor of nephrectomy at post-chemotherapy
      retroperitoneal lymph node dissection was retroperitoneal mass size greater than 
      10 cm (OR 9.30, 95% CI 3.8-22.7). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of nephrectomy at
      post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection has decreased in the last
      3 decades. A higher incidence was observed in patients with larger volume tumors,
      those who received salvage chemotherapy, those with a left primary testicular
      tumor and those with increased markers at post-chemotherapy surgery.

AB  - PURPOSE: Prostate specific antigen and digital rectal examination have low
      specificity for detecting prostate cancer and they poorly predict the presence of
      aggressive disease. Urine is readily available and noninvasive, and it represents
      a promising source of biomarkers for the early detection and prediction of
      prostate cancer prognosis. We identified promising biomarkers for urine based
      prostate cancer, examined trends and outlined potential pitfalls. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: We performed PubMed(R) and Web of Science(R) database searches of the
      peer reviewed literature on urine based testing for prostate cancer. Original
      studies of this subject as well as a small number of reviews were analyzed,
      including the strengths and weaknesses. We provide a comprehensive review of
      urine based testing for prostate cancer that covers the technical aspects,
      including the methodology of urine collection, as well as recent developments in 
      biomarkers spanning the fields of genomics, epigenetics, transcriptomics,
      proteomics and metabolomics. RESULTS: The process of urine collection is subject 
      to variability, which may result in conflicting clinical results. Detecting
      prostate cancer in urine is technically feasible, as demonstrated by numerous
      proof of principle studies, but few markers have been validated in multiple large
      sample sets. Biomarker development using urine has been accelerating in recent
      years with numerous studies identifying DNA, RNA, protein and metabolite based
      biomarkers in urine. Advanced clinical studies have identified PCA3 and
      TMPRSS2:ERG fusion transcripts as promising RNA markers for cancer detection and 
      possibly prognosis. DNA methylation analysis of multiple genes improves
      specificity and represents a promising platform for developing clinical grade
      assays. CONCLUSIONS: Urine based testing is noninvasive and represents a rich
      source of novel biomarkers for prostate cancer. Although urine shows promise for 
      detecting cancer, the ability to identify aggressive subsets of prostate cancer
      needs further development.

AB  - PURPOSE: Urinary incontinence is a frequent complication of radical prostatectomy
      with a detrimental impact on quality of life. We identified predictors and trends
      in the use of procedures for post-prostatectomy incontinence. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Using SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) cancer registry 
      data linked with Medicare claims, we identified men 66 years old or older who
      were treated with radical prostatectomy in 2000 to 2007. The primary outcome was 
      performance of an incontinence procedure. Demographic and clinical predictors of 
      incontinence surgery were evaluated by multivariable regression analysis.
      RESULTS: Of 16,348 men treated with radical prostatectomy 1,057 (6%) had
      undergone at least 1 incontinence procedure by a median of 20 months after the
      procedure, including 61% who underwent the first incontinence procedure within 2 
      years of prostatectomy. Older age and residence in the South were associated with
      greater probability of an incontinence procedure. Black men and those living in
      nonmetropolitan areas were less likely than their peers to undergo an
      incontinence procedure. Of men treated with any incontinence procedure 15%
      underwent more than 1 type. Of those treated with bulking agents 39% also
      received a urethral sling or artificial urinary sphincter and 13% who received a 
      sling also had an artificial urinary sphincter. In 34% of the men who underwent
      any incontinence surgery artificial urinary sphincter placement was the only
      procedure performed. CONCLUSIONS: In this population based cohort of older men
      with prostate cancer only 6% underwent an incontinence procedure after
      prostatectomy. This low rate may reflect the underuse of potentially beneficial
      procedures.

AB  - PURPOSE: Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy for bladder cancer has 
      been reported with potential for improvement in perioperative morbidity compared 
      to the open approach. However, most studies are retrospective with significant
      selection bias. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pilot prospective randomized trial
      evaluating perioperative outcomes and oncologic efficacy of open vs robotic
      assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy for consecutive patients was performed
      from July 2009 to June 2011. RESULTS: To date 47 patients have been randomized
      with data available on 40 patients for analysis. Each group was similar with
      regard to age, gender, race, body mass index and comorbidities, as well as
      previous surgeries, operative time, postoperative complications and final
      pathological stage. We observed no significant differences between oncologic
      outcomes of positive margins (5% each, p = 0.50) or number of lymph nodes removed
      for open radical cystectomy (23, IQR 15-28) vs robotic assisted laparoscopic
      radical cystectomy (11, IQR 8.75-21.5) groups (p = 0.135). The robotic assisted
      laparoscopic radical cystectomy group (400 ml, IQR 300-762.5) was noted to have
      decreased estimated blood loss compared to the open radical cystectomy group (800
      ml, IQR 400-1,100) and trended toward a decreased rate of excessive length of
      stay (greater than 5 days) (65% vs 90%, p = 0.11) compared to the open radical
      cystectomy group. The robotic group also trended toward fewer transfusions (40%
      vs 50%, p = 0.26). CONCLUSIONS: Our study validates the concept of randomizing
      patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy to an open or robotic 
      approach. Our results suggest no significant differences in surrogates of
      oncologic efficacy. Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy demonstrates
      potential benefits of decreased estimated blood loss and decreased hospital stay 
      compared to open radical cystectomy. Our results need to be validated in a larger
      multicenter prospective randomized clinical trial.

      skin cancer one of the most highly curable malignancies. By simply becoming aware
      of common lesions and their phenotypic presentation, dental professionals are
      empowered to detect suspicious dermatologic lesions in unaware patients. This
      article serves as an introduction to skin cancer and benign skin lesions for
      dental professionals.

AB  - Because Romania has the highest incidence of cervical cancer in Europe, in 2008 a
      HPV vaccination campaign was introduced targeting 10-11 year old girls. However, 
      only 2.5% of the eligible girls were given parental for vaccination. Campaign
      failure makes it important to look for possible reasons and investigate mothers' 
      attitudes and perceptions of the HPV vaccine. Three focus groups and 11
      interviews were conducted with mothers from urban areas. Data were transcribed
      verbatim and analysed with thematic analysis. Results show as main reasons for
      not vaccinating their daughters perceiving the vaccine as risky, the belief that 
      the vaccine represents an experiment that uses their daughters as guinea pigs,
      the belief that the vaccine embodies a conspiracy theory that aims to reduce the 
      world's population and general mistrust in the ineffective health system. Mothers
      stated they would need clear, factual information about the HPV vaccine and its
      link to cervical cancer in order to motivate them to accept it for their
      daughters. The study offers insight into the beliefs and attitudes towards the
      vaccine and provides ideas for structuring future health communication campaigns 
      regarding the HPV vaccine.

TI  - The identification of plasma proteins associated with cancer-related fatigue
      syndrome (CRFS) in disease-free breast cancer patients using proteomic analysis.

AB  - CONTEXT: Cancer-related fatigue syndrome (CRFS) affects a significant minority of
      women successfully treated for breast cancer, with symptoms lasting up to several
      years after finishing therapy. OBJECTIVES: This analysis was conducted to
      identify plasma proteins associated with CRFS in disease-free breast cancer
      patients. METHODS: Women were divided into those meeting the CRFS criteria
      (cases) and a control group on the basis of a diagnostic interview. Plasma
      samples were collected from 45 cases and 45 controls. Proteomic analysis was
      conducted using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization, a mass spectrometry
      (MS) technique. This was followed by further sample processing using
      one-dimensional gels and trypsin digest for protein identification using liquid
      chromatography and database searching. RESULTS: CRFS was associated with a
      statistically significant increase in the intensity of seven MS spectra. A
      subsequent search of proteins corresponding to the MS spectra identified four
      acute phase proteins associated with a nonspecific immune response (serum amyloid
      A, collectin, and subunits of immunoglobulin G and complement C1Q). CONCLUSION:
      These novel results (using a technique not previously used in fatigue research)
      add further weight to the hypothesis that CRFS may be precipitated and prolonged 
      by a nonspecific sustained inflammatory response. Importantly, this has been
      identified from a global analysis of plasma, which was conducted with no prior
      assumptions. Although these results need confirmation, we would suggest that
      future treatments for CRFS should consider focusing on the modulation of this
      presumed prolonged immune response.

AB  - CONTEXT: Prescription Monitoring Programs (PMPs) are being developed and
      implemented in many states to deter abuse, diversion, and overdose, and
      physicians may use PMPs to help guide their treatment choices for individual
      patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the changes in prescribing practices and pain
      score outcomes in patients with cancer before and after an initial consult in an 
      outpatient palliative care clinic. METHODS: This is a retrospective study with a 
      sample of 60 consecutive patients who had been referred by oncologists for
      difficult-to-manage pain and whose initial palliative care consult was with
      either of the two physicians in the outpatient palliative care clinic. For each
      patient, lists were compiled of all prescriptions for controlled medications and 
      filled for the 90-day periods immediately before and after the initial consult.
      Data from patient charts were combined with information from the Virginia PMP,
      which included prescriptions written before and after the initiation of
      palliative care, written by prescribers both inside and outside the palliative
      care clinic. RESULTS: After the palliative care consult, the proportion of
      patients on long-acting opioids increased from 45% to 73%. Self-reported pain
      outcomes, which were compiled for the subset of patients who continued palliative
      care for at least 60 days, showed a median decrease of two units on a 0-10 scale.
      A decrease was seen in the use of medications that compound acetaminophen with
      opioids. CONCLUSION: Data from a PMP proved useful in understanding the changes
      in a population of patients. Favorable changes were observed in prescribing
      practices and pain outcomes.

AB  - CONTEXT: Understanding the types and extent of need is critical to informing
      needs-based care for people with chronic heart failure (CHF). OBJECTIVES: To
      explore the psychometric quality of a newly developed rapid screening measure to 
      assess the supportive and palliative care needs of people with CHF. METHODS: A
      convenience sample of multidisciplinary health professionals working in heart
      failure care was invited to comment, via an online survey and consultation, on
      suitability and required modifications to a validated cancer care needs
      assessment measure to inform the support and palliative care needs of patients
      with CHF and their caregivers. Psychometric testing was then undertaken with 52
      patients with CHF recruited from a multidisciplinary heart failure service to
      explore inter-rater reliability and concurrent validity of the newly adapted
      Needs Assessment Tool: Progressive Disease-Heart Failure (NAT: PD-HF). RESULTS:
      Health professionals (n=21) rated the tool as easy to administer, comprehensive, 
      and relevant for the CHF population. Prevalence- and bias-adjusted kappa values
      indicated good agreement between pairs of raters for each item in the NAT: PD-HF 
      (range 0.54-0.90). Participants indicating a higher severity of concern in the
      NAT: PD-HF physical, daily living, and spiritual items reported significantly
      higher Heart Failure Needs Assessment Questionnaire physical and existential
      scores. CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence for the NAT: PD-HF
      as a potential strategy for identifying and informing the management of physical 
      and psychosocial issues experienced by people with CHF. Further work is needed to
      examine additional psychometrics, benefits relating to unnecessary symptom
      burden, futile treatments, and admissions to hospital.

AB  - CONTEXT: Previous studies have revealed inconsistent findings about the
      longitudinal evolution of cancer-related symptoms. In addition, the contribution 
      of medical factors (e.g., cancer site, and treatments) in explaining the changes 
      in these symptoms is yet to be established. OBJECTIVES: This prospective study
      investigated longitudinal changes of five symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety,
      insomnia, fatigue, and pain) in patients scheduled to undergo surgery for cancer 
      (N=828). METHODS: The patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
      Scale, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, and a
      pain questionnaire at baseline and after 2, 6, 10, 14 and 18 months. RESULTS:
      Several time changes were statistically significant but effect sizes only
      revealed one change of a medium magnitude, that is, a reduction of anxiety from
      T1 to T2 (d=-0.58). Women with breast or gynecological cancer were the only
      subgroups to exhibit significant changes (i.e., reduction of a small magnitude of
      anxiety symptoms from T1 to T2; ds=-0.27 and -0.30, respectively). However,
      numerous differences were found across adjuvant treatments, including greater
      variations in depression and insomnia scores in the chemotherapy group (ds=-0.71 
      to 0.20) and a transient increase in fatigue symptoms in patients receiving "all"
      adjuvant treatments (ds=-0.24 to 0.37). CONCLUSION: The severity of
      cancer-related symptoms varies during the cancer care trajectory, especially
      anxiety scores, which importantly decrease during the first few months after the 
      surgery. This study also suggests that treatment regimens better account for
      individual differences than cancer site in the evolution of symptoms.

AB  - CONTEXT: To improve the management of cancer-related symptoms, systematic
      screening is necessary, often performed by using 0-10 numeric rating scales. Cut 
      points are used to determine if scores represent clinically relevant burden.
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review was to explore the evidence on cut 
      points for the symptoms of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale. METHODS:
      Relevant literature was searched in PubMed, CINAHL(R), Embase, and PsycINFO(R).
      We defined a cut point as the lower bound of the scores representing moderate or 
      severe burden. RESULTS: Eighteen articles were eligible for this review. Cut
      points were determined using the interference with daily life, another
      symptom-related method, or a verbal scale. For pain, cut point 5 and, to a lesser
      extent, cut point 7 were found as the optimal cut points for moderate pain and
      severe pain, respectively. For moderate tiredness, the best cut point seemed to
      be cut point 4. For severe tiredness, both cut points 7 and 8 were suggested
      frequently. A lack of evidence exists for nausea, depression, anxiety,
      drowsiness, appetite, well-being, and shortness of breath. Few studies suggested 
      a cut point below 4. CONCLUSION: For many symptoms, there is no clear evidence as
      to what the optimal cut points are. In daily clinical practice, a symptom score
      >/=4 is recommended as a trigger for a more comprehensive symptom assessment.
      Until there is more evidence on the optimal cut points, we should hold back using
      a certain cut point in quality indicators and be cautious about strongly
      recommending a certain cut point in guidelines.

AB  - CONTEXT: Hot flashes (HFs) and sexual dysfunction often affect breast cancer (BC)
      survivors and compromise their quality of life. Bupropion is an antidepressive
      medication used for smoking cessation and also has been previously studied for
      the treatment of sexual dysfunction. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate bupropion's
      efficacy in controlling HFs in BC survivors. METHODS: This was a randomized,
      double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled pilot study that enrolled 55 BC
      survivors who reported more than seven HFs per week. Subjects were randomized to 
      receive either bupropion 150mg twice daily for four weeks followed by one week of
      washout and four more weeks of placebo twice daily or vice versa. The primary end
      point was average daily HF activity (number of HFs and a score combining number
      and severity) reported while on bupropion or on placebo. Secondary end points
      were sexual dysfunction, depression, and quality of life evaluated with the
      Arizona Sexual Experience Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and European
      Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life
      Questionnaire-C30, respectively. RESULTS: Bupropion reduced HFs by 1.26 per day
      and the HF score by 6.31%, whereas placebo reduced HFs by 2.11 per day (P>0.05)
      and the HF score by 30.47% (P>0.05). There were no statistically significant
      differences between bupropion and placebo in the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale,
      Beck Depression Inventory, and European Organization for Research and Treatment
      of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30. At the end of the study, 47% of the 
      patients preferred bupropion, whereas 53% preferred placebo. There were no
      statistically significant differences in side effects between the study groups.
      CONCLUSION: Compared with placebo, bupropion did not control HFs in this group of
      BC survivors.

AB  - CONTEXT: The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck is a
      well-validated assessment of quality of life used with patients diagnosed with
      head and neck cancers (HCNs). The present study is an attempt to evaluate and
      modify this instrument as necessary in light of the recent regulatory guidelines 
      from the Food and Drug Administration on the use of patient-reported outcomes in 
      clinical trials. OBJECTIVES: Overall, the goal was to identify patients' highest 
      priority cancer symptoms, compare these symptoms with those suggested by oncology
      experts, and construct a brief symptom index to assess these symptoms and
      categorize them as treatment-related, disease-related, or related to general
      function and well-being. METHODS: Patients (N=49) with advanced (Stages III and
      IV) HCNs were recruited from participating National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
      institutions and community cancer support organizations in the Chicago area.
      Patients completed open-ended interviews and symptom checklists. Participating
      oncology physician experts also rated symptoms. Content validity was obtained by 
      evaluating results alongside items in the Functional Assessment of Chronic
      Illness Therapy system. Eleven oncologists categorized symptoms in terms of
      importance and also whether the symptoms were primarily related to disease,
      treatment, or functional well-being. RESULTS: HCN-related symptoms endorsed as
      high priority by both patients and oncology experts were selected for the new
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network-Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-Head and Neck Cancer Symptom Index-22. The final version includes 22
      items, which are broken down into disease-related symptoms, treatment side
      effects, or general function and well-being. The new scale has acceptable
      internal consistency (Cronbach's coefficient alpha=0.86), content validity for
      use in chemotherapy trials of patients with advanced disease, and concurrent
      validity as demonstrated by moderate-to-strong correlations with the existing
      Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy measure. CONCLUSION: The
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network-Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-Head and Neck Cancer Symptom Index-22 adequately reflects symptom and
      side effect concerns of advanced HCN patients as well as oncology physicians.
      This instrument can be used to evaluate the most important disease-related
      symptoms, treatment side effects, and function/well-being in patients with
      advanced HCNs in clinical practice and research.

AB  - CONTEXT: Exercise benefits patients with cancer, but studies of home-based
      approaches, particularly among those with Stage IV disease, remain small and
      exploratory. OBJECTIVES: To conduct an adequately powered trial of a home-based
      exercise intervention that can be facilely integrated into established delivery
      and reimbursement structures. METHODS: Sixty-six adults with Stage IV lung or
      colorectal cancer were randomized, in an eight-week trial, to usual care or
      incremental walking and home-based strength training. The exercising participants
      were instructed during a single physiotherapy visit and subsequently exercised
      four days or more per week; training and step-count goals were advanced during
      bimonthly telephone calls. The primary outcome measure was mobility assessed with
      the Ambulatory Post Acute Care Basic Mobility Short Form. Secondary outcomes
      included ratings of pain and sleep quality as well as the ability to perform
      daily activities (Ambulatory Post Acute Care Daily Activities Short Form),
      quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General), and fatigue
      (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue). RESULTS: Three participants
      dropped out and seven died (five in the intervention and two in the control
      group, P=0.28). At Week 8, the intervention group reported improved mobility
      (P=0.01), fatigue (P=0.02), and sleep quality (P=0.05) compared with the usual
      care group, but did not differ on the other measures. CONCLUSION: A home-based
      exercise program seems capable of improving the mobility, fatigue, and sleep
      quality of patients with Stage IV lung and colorectal cancer.

AB  - CONTEXT: Data regarding prognostication of life expectancy in patients with
      advanced cancer are of paramount importance to patients, families, and
      clinicians. However, data regarding patients followed at home are lacking.
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between various
      factors recorded at the beginning of home care assistance and survival. METHODS: 
      A sample of consecutive patients admitted to two home care programs was surveyed.
      A preliminary consensus was achieved as to the possible variables easy to be
      recorded at home. These included age at the time of home care admission, gender, 
      residence, marital status, primary cancer diagnosis, Karnofsky Performance Status
      (KPS) score, measures of systolic blood pressure and heart rate, cyanosis, use of
      oxygen, and body temperature. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System was used to 
      record the intensity of each symptom. Patients were divided into two groups:
      patients with a survival of less than 10 days (short survival) and patients with 
      a survival of 10 days or more (medium-long survival). RESULTS: Three hundred
      seventy-four consecutive patients admitted to home care programs were surveyed,
      of which 187 were male. The mean+/-SD age was 72.1+/-12.7 years. The mean
      survival was 56.2+/-65 days. Mean survival was 71.5+/-67 days (287 patients) and 
      5.6+/-2.7 days (87 patients) in the short and medium-long survival groups,
      respectively. No association between type of tumor and survival was observed
      (P=0.162). Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that male gender
      (P=0.020), older age (P=0.012), lower KPS scores (P<0.0005), systolic blood
      pressure less than 100 mmHg (P=0.003), heart rate greater than 100 beats per
      minute (P=0.0006), delirium (P=0.004), the use of oxygen (P=0.002), intensity of 
      fatigue (P=0.006), drowsiness (P<0.0005), anorexia (P<0.0005), dyspnea
      (P<0.0005), poor sense of well-being (P<0.0005), and distress score (P<0.0005)
      were associated with a survival of less than 10 days. Marital status, residence, 
      cognitive function, fever, pain, depression, and anxiety were not found to be
      significantly correlated with survival. In a multiple logistic regression model, 
      low systolic blood pressure and high heart rate, gender, delirium, use of oxygen,
      KPS score, drowsiness, anorexia, and dyspnea were significantly correlated with a
      shorter survival. CONCLUSION: Low systolic blood pressure and high heart rate,
      male gender, poor KPS score, anorexia, and dyspnea were correlated with a shorter
      survival. Moreover, patients with low systolic blood pressure and high heart
      rate, male gender, poor KPS score, and greater intensity of anorexia and dyspnea 
      are more likely to die within one week. The combination of physical symptoms from
      the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System and other parameters included in this
      study, which are simple to assess and are repeatable at home, should be further
      explored in future studies to provide a simple tool for use with patients with
      advanced cancer admitted to a home care program.

AB  - CONTEXT: Prescription of opioid analgesics is a key component of pain management 
      among persons with cancer at the end of life. OBJECTIVES: To use a
      population-based method to assess the use of opioid analgesics within the
      community among older persons with colorectal cancer (CRC) before death and
      determine factors associated with the use of opioid analgesics. METHODS: Data
      were derived from a retrospective, linked administrative database study of all
      persons who were diagnosed with CRC between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2005
      in Nova Scotia, Canada. This study included all persons who 1) were 66 years or
      older at the date of diagnosis; 2) died between January 1, 2001 and April 1,
      2008; and 3) resided in health districts with formal palliative care programs
      (PCPs) (n=657). Factors associated with having filled at least one prescription
      for a so-called "strong" opioid analgesic in the six months before death were
      examined using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: In all, 36.7% filled at
      least one prescription for any opioid in the six months before death. Adjusting
      for all covariates, filling a prescription for a strong opioid was associated
      with enrollment in a PCP (odds ratio [OR]=3.18, 95% CI=2.05-4.94), residence in a
      long-term care facility (OR=2.19, 95% CI=1.23-3.89), and a CRC cause of death
      (OR=1.75, 95% CI=1.14-2.68). Persons were less likely to fill a prescription for 
      a strong opioid if they were older (OR=0.97, 95% CI=0.95-0.99), male (OR=0.59,
      95% 0.40-0.86), and diagnosed less than six months before death (OR=0.62, 95%
      CI=0.41-0.93). CONCLUSION: PCPs may play an important role in enabling access to 
      end-of-life care within the community.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Randomized controlled trials remain the gold standard for evaluating 
      cancer intervention efficacy. Randomized trials are not always feasible,
      practical, or timely and often don't adequately reflect patient heterogeneity and
      real-world clinical practice. Comparative effectiveness research can leverage
      secondary data to help fill knowledge gaps randomized trials leave unaddressed;
      however, comparative effectiveness research also faces shortcomings. The goal of 
      this project was to develop a new model and inform an evolving framework
      articulating cancer comparative effectiveness research data needs. STUDY DESIGN
      AND SETTING: We examined prevalent models and conducted semi-structured
      discussions with 76 clinicians and comparative effectiveness research researchers
      affiliated with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's cancer
      comparative effectiveness research programs. RESULTS: A new model was iteratively
      developed and presents cancer comparative effectiveness research and important
      measures in a patient-centered, longitudinal chronic care model better reflecting
      contemporary cancer care in the context of the cancer care continuum, rather than
      a single-episode, acute-care perspective. CONCLUSION: Immediately relevant for
      federally funded comparative effectiveness research programs, the model informs
      an evolving framework articulating cancer comparative effectiveness research data
      needs, including evolutionary enhancements to registries and epidemiologic
      research data systems. We discuss elements of contemporary clinical practice,
      methodology improvements, and related needs affecting comparative effectiveness
      research's ability to yield findings clinicians, policy makers, and stakeholders 
      can confidently act on.

PG  - 92-9
LID - 10.1684/bdc.2012.1636 [doi]
AB  - "Classic" Kaposi's sarcoma (CKS) not related to HIV is a multifocal
      angioproliferative neoplasm that is linked to human herpesvirus. CKS is a
      cutaneous cancer frequently occurring with an indolent course. However, it can
      compromise the quality of life by causing pain, disfigurement and functional
      disability. For this reason, the main treatment goals are not only to reduce the 
      cutaneous lesions but also to alleviate organ involvement and psychological
      stress by delaying disease progression and ultimately cure. This report
      summarizes systemic treatment options of CKS, including chemotherapy,
      immunotherapy and anti-HHV8 therapy. In addition, this review will focus on the
      recent understanding of carcinogenesis and consequently highlight potential
      "targeted" therapeutic interventions.

AB  - In the present study, we aimed to evaluate estrogen receptor ER-alpha status in
      61 breast cancer cases using Sp1 and 1D5 monoclonal antibodies. Tissue array
      platforms were generated containing samples of breast cancer and positive
      controls that were assayed by immunohistochemistry applying monoclonal primary
      antibodies anti-ER alpha, SP1 and 1D5. We noted a high concordance rate (96.7%)
      between the referred antibodies. Moreover, we calculated the Kappa factor
      (0.921), indicating that 1D5 and SP1 provided overlapping ERalpha expression
      results. Indeed, we observed controversial results only in 2 samples studied,
      which were ER-negative when stained with 1D5 and ER-positive when assessed with
      SP1. Total concordance of PS was obtained (Pearson and intraclass CF, 0.7351 and 
      0.6193, respectively). However, concordance between the antibodies seems to be
      more accurate in higher PS values. An excellent IS correlation between antibodies
      was observed throughout the population (Spearman's CF, rho=0.9150). Following the
      Allred score, 17 out of 42 positive BC samples diverged, with 1D5 always pointing
      to weaker staining than SP1. When calculating Spearman's CF of Total Score (TS)
      within the population, an excellent correlation between both the antibodies
      (rho=0.9238) was noted. Nonetheless, the results were less concordant among the
      BC-positive cases (rho=0.7743). Indeed, 20 samples were differentially classified
      using the antibodies (only 3 had higher TS with 1D5). Considering the mean TS of 
      all samples or of invasive ductal carcinoma, SP1 provided higher scores than 1D5 
      (p<0.05). We recommend the use of the anti-ER RMAb SP1 due to the high
      probability that the BC ERalpha status can be determined accurately as the
      reagent provides higher IS. Therefore, the A-score was higher than the MMAb 1D5. 
      Ultimately, higher IS and A-score decrease the possibility of ERalpha status
      misinterpretation and, consequently, inappropriate BC treatment that would
      compromise the patient's quality of life and overall survival. We recommend the
      use of anti-ER RMAb SP1 due to the high probability that the BC ER status can be 
      determined accurately as the reagent provides higher IS, therefore higher
      A-score, than the MMAb 1D5.

      cancer: the pilot phase of a randomised controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy and radiotherapy are more
      effective than similar postoperative treatment for oesophageal, gastric, and
      rectal cancers, perhaps because of more effective micrometastasis eradication and
      reduced risk of incomplete excision and tumour cell shedding during surgery. The 
      FOxTROT trial aims to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of
      preoperative chemotherapy for colon cancer. METHODS: In the pilot stage of this
      randomised controlled trial, 150 patients with radiologically staged locally
      advanced (T3 with >/=5 mm invasion beyond the muscularis propria or T4) tumours
      from 35 UK centres were randomly assigned (2:1) to preoperative (three cycles of 
      OxMdG [oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2), l-folinic acid 175 mg, fluorouracil 400 mg/m(2)
      bolus, then 2400 mg/m(2) by 46 h infusion] repeated at 2-weekly intervals
      followed by surgery and a further nine cycles of OxMdG) or standard postoperative
      chemotherapy (12 cycles of OxMdG). Patients with KRAS wild-type tumours were
      randomly assigned (1:1) to receive panitumumab (6 mg/kg; every 2 weeks with the
      first 6 weeks of chemotherapy) or not. Treatment allocation was through a central
      randomisation service using a minimised randomisation procedure including age,
      radiological T and N stage, site of tumour, and presence of defunctioning
      colostomy as stratification variables. Primary outcome measures of the pilot
      phase were feasibility, safety, and tolerance of preoperative therapy, and
      accuracy of radiological staging. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial 
      is registered, number ISRCTN 87163246. FINDINGS: 96% (95 of 99) of patients
      started and 89% (85 of 95) completed preoperative chemotherapy with grade 3-4
      gastrointestinal toxicity in 7% (seven of 94) of patients. All 99 tumours in the 
      preoperative group were resected, with no significant differences in
      postoperative morbidity between the preoperative and control groups: 14% (14 of
      99) versus 12% (six of 51) had complications prolonging hospital stay (p=0.81).
      98% (50 of 51) of postoperative chemotherapy patients had T3 or more advanced
      tumours confirmed at post-resection pathology compared with 91% (90 of 99) of
      patients following preoperative chemotherapy (p=0.10). Preoperative therapy
      resulted in significant downstaging of TNM5 compared with the postoperative group
      (p=0.04), including two pathological complete responses, apical node involvement 
      (1% [one of 98] vs 20% [ten of 50], p<0.0001), resection margin involvement (4%
      [four of 99] vs 20% [ten of 50], p=0.002), and blinded centrally scored tumour
      regression grading: 31% (29 of 94) vs 2% (one of 46) moderate or greater
      regression (p=0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Preoperative chemotherapy for
      radiologically staged, locally advanced operable primary colon cancer is feasible
      with acceptable toxicity and perioperative morbidity. Proceeding to the phase 3
      trial, to establish whether the encouraging pathological responses seen with
      preoperative therapy translates into improved long-term oncological outcome, is
      appropriate. FUNDING: Cancer Research UK.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study proposes to assess MBL serum concentrations in HPV positive
      women that developed high risk preinvasive lesions, CIN III. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A total of 90 consecutive women (mean age 32.2 years, range 18-45 years)
      with CIN III lesions confirmed by cone biopsy were enrolled as cases at the
      gynecology cancer department of the Erasto Gaertner Hospital, a center of
      reference for cancer treatment in Southern Brazil. All the patients were HPV
      positive. In addition, 81 healthy women, voluntary blood donors, were enrolled as
      healthy control subjects (mean age 33.3 years, range 14-71 years) with no
      evidence of HPV infection, tested by hybrid capture, or CIN lesions, from the
      same geographic area. RESULTS: The median concentration of MBL in the cases was
      912 ng/ml (IQR: 100-5820 ng/ml) and in the controls was 1207.3 ng/ml (IQR
      100-4320.6 ng/ml). No statistically significant difference was observed between
      cases and controls. CONCLUSION: This study reports data on MBL serum
      concentrations in HPV infected women for the first time. The analysis of our
      findings did not show a statistically significant difference between MBL serum
      concentrations in HPV women that developed CIN III lesions and healthy controls.

AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract is home to an extremely numerous and diverse
      collection of microbes, collectively termed the "intestinal microbiota". This
      microbiota is considered to play a number of key roles in the maintenance of host
      health, including aiding digestion of otherwise indigestible dietary compounds,
      synthesis of vitamins and other beneficial metabolites, immune system regulation 
      and enhanced resistance against colonisation by pathogenic microorganisms.
      Conversely, the intestinal microbiota is also a potent source of antigens and
      potentially harmful compounds. In health, humans can therefore be considered to
      exist in a state of natural balance with their microbial inhabitants. A shift in 
      the balance of microbiota composition such that it may become deleterious to host
      health is termed "dysbiosis". Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been implicated
      in numerous disorders, ranging from intestinal maladies such as inflammatory
      bowel diseases and colorectal cancer to disorders with more systemic effects such
      as diabetes, metabolic syndrome and atopy. Given the far reaching influence of
      the intestinal microbiota on human health a clear future goal must be to develop 
      reliable means to alter the composition of the microbiota and restore a healthy
      balance of microbial species. While it is clear that much fundamental research
      remains to be done, potentially important therapeutic options include narrow
      spectrum antibiotics, novel probiotics, dietary interventions and more radical
      techniques such as faecal transplantation, all of which aim to suppress clinical 
      dysbiosis, restore intestinal microbiota diversity and improve host health.

      antigen microarrays: application to the sensitive and specific detection of tumor
      markers from breast cancer sera.

AB  - There is an urgent need to identify relevant tumor markers showing high
      sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer.
      Protein microarrays have demonstrated to be cost-effective, high through-put and 
      powerful tools for screening and identifying tumor markers with only minute
      samples. Autoantibodies directed against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) were
      shown to be relevant tumor markers. However, due to the variability of immune
      response from one individual to another and depending on the type of cancer,
      detection of only one type of anti-TAA autoantibody is not sufficient to give a
      reliable and precise diagnosis. It is necessary to use a set of several TAAs for 
      determining specific autoimmune profiles. Therefore, combining various TAAs on
      different surfaces could improve sensitivity and specificity for anti-TAA
      autoantibody detection. Herein a panel of 10 proteins, including well-known
      tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and potential new biomarkers of breast cancer,
      were immobilized onto microstructured microarray under optimized conditions
      (spotting pH buffer, surface chemistry, blocking procedure), in order to
      determine an autoimmune signature of breast cancer. Sera from 29 breast cancer
      patients and 28 healthy donors were screened in sandwich immunoassays on the
      miniaturized system to detect the eventual presence of anti-TAAs autoantibodies. 
      Results indicated that the detection level of each anti-TAA autoantibody in a
      given serum sample was strongly dependant on the surface chemistry. Combining
      five TAAs (p53, Hsp60, Hsp70, Her2-Fc, NY-ESO-1) on two different surface
      chemistries (NHS and APDMES) allowed the significant detection of more than 82%
      breast cancer sera.

AB  - Obesity is a recognized breast cancer risk factor in postmenopausal women. A
      recent hypothesis suggests a major role for adipose tissue in carcinogenesis.
      During many years, the adipose tissue was only considered as a fat storage of
      energy. This tissue is now described as an endocrine organ secreting a large
      range of molecules called adipokines. Among these adipokines, adiponectin may
      play a major role in breast cancer. Plasma adiponectin levels were found to be
      decreased in cases of breast cancer and in obese patients. Adiponectin may act
      directly on breast cancer cells by inhibiting proliferation and angiogenesis or
      by stimulating apoptosis. Increasing adiponectin levels may be of major
      importance in the prevention and/or the treatment of breast cancer. This
      therapeutic approach may be of particular significance for obese patients. The
      beneficial effects of adiponectin and its possible therapeutic applications will 
      be discussed in this review.

AB  - Because of increasing breast cancer incidence and improvement in long-term
      prognosis, follow-up of patients cannot be carried out entirely in specialized
      cancer centres. The Reseau Gynecomed was created to transfer the follow-up of
      patients to primary care physicians (PCP). In 2009, to evaluate the quality of
      PCP follow-up, a satisfaction study was performed for the 1,245 women followed
      after breast cancer. Sixty-four percent of the women participate in the study.
      Before starting follow-up, 87% were informed about its purpose and 93% about its 
      schedule. The satisfaction score was excellent (91%). Old age, perception of a
      good health status, a high quality of information about and a confident
      relationship with their PCP were associated with a better satisfaction level.
      Forty-eight percent of patients thought easy to accept the PCP follow-up.
      Considering this data, PCP monitoring seems to provide a good follow-up and may
      be developed. Nonetheless, conditions of patients' choice should be improved and 
      particularly exclude patients with financial difficulties. It would facilitate
      the growing transfer of follow-up to the PCP.

      screening patients for clinical trials].
PG  - 1065-8
LID - 10.1684/bdc.2012.1643 [doi]
AB  - beta-HCG belongs to the glycoprotein hormone family and is usually assess to
      exclude pregnancy for patients potentially eligible to chemotherapy, especially
      during clinical trials. We studied non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients
      that were found with elevated serum beta-HCG level during clinical trial
      screening. The first case is a 45-year-old woman who presented with a stage IV
      undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung eligible for chemotherapy. When screening 
      the patient for a clinical trial combining platinum-based chemotherapy and
      targeted therapy, the plasma beta-HCG level was 19 IU/L (0-5 IU/L). The second
      case is a 64-year-old woman presented with stage IV poorly differentiated
      adenocarcinoma of the lung. When screening the patient for the same clinical
      trial combining platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy, the plasma
      beta-HCG level was beta-HCG 13 IU/L (0-5 IU/L). The serum dosages were
      double-checked and confirmed elevated beta-HCG level. The gynecological work-up
      definitely rules out an improbable pregnancy. The pathological examination was
      also checked and confirmed in the two cases a primary lung cancer. An
      immuno-histochemical reassessment of the pathological specimens with additional
      tests was performed: for one patient 25% of tumor cells expressed beta-HCG. As
      pregnancies were ruled out, the two cases were extensively discussed with the
      promoter and the patients finally treated within this clinical trial. The
      treatments are ongoing. beta-HCG is a specific marker for trophoblastic tumors of
      placenta and gestational tumors. Ectopic expression of beta-HCG was found in
      20-40% of all common epithelial carcinoma, especially for tumors of the stomach, 
      ovary, liver and lung. Only few cases have been reported in the literature.
      However, in a young patient with high serum levels of beta-HCG two questions
      arise: is there a place for pregnancy? Are the pathology results accurate? All
      this could delay the appropriate management of these patients and also
      potentially prevents the participation of innovative therapeutic strategies.
      Therefore, knowing this rare but possible expression of beta-HCG by lung tumors
      may speed out the gynecological work-up and the reevaluation of the histological 
      samples in order to minimize the delay in the care of these patients and give
      them a chance to have new innovative drugs within clinical trial.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the significance of
      parenchymal splenic metastasis (PSM) in ovarian (OC), fallopian tube (FTC), and
      primary peritoneal cancer (PPC). METHODS: All patients with stage IIIB-IV OC,
      FTC, and PPC undergoing primary cytoreduction from 2001 to 2010 at our
      institution were identified. In patients undergoing splenectomy, pathology was
      reviewed for the presence of PSM. Multivariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier
      survival analysis were used to evaluate factors associated with overall survival 
      (OS). RESULTS: Of 576 patients identified, stage was: IIIB - 23 (4%), IIIC - 468 
      (81.2%), and IV - 85 (14.8%). Optimal cytoreduction was achieved in 430 patients 
      (74.7%), including 85 of 97 patients (87.6%) undergoing splenectomy. PSM was
      identified in 20 patients (20.6%) undergoing splenectomy, including 3 of 5
      patients (60%) with radiographically identified parenchymal liver metastases and 
      17 of 92 patients (18.5%) without such radiographic findings (P=0.059). Age,
      preoperative albumin, residual disease, stage, bulky upper abdominal disease, IP 
      chemotherapy, and PSM were associated with OS on univariate analysis. Splenectomy
      was not associated with survival. Age, preoperative albumin, residual disease,
      stage, and PSM (HR=0.46; 95% CI, 0.27-0.77) were associated with OS on
      multivariate analysis. In the subset of patients undergoing splenectomy, OS was
      lower for patients with PSM versus those without PSM (28.5 v 51.2months,
      P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: PSM is independently associated with decreased OS in
      patients with advanced OC, FTC, and PPC. PSM occurs in the setting of other
      evidence of hematogenously disseminated disease, but also occurs outside this
      setting. PSM should be considered a criterion for stage IV disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study aims at identifying novel markers for circulating tumor
      cells (CTCs) in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), and at evaluating 
      their impact on outcome. METHODS: Microarray analysis comparing matched EOC
      tissues and peripheral blood leucocytes (N=35) was performed to identify novel
      CTC markers. Gene expression of these novel markers and of EpCAM was analyzed
      using RT-qPCR in blood samples taken from healthy females (N=39) and from EOC
      patients (N=216) before primary treatment and six months after adjuvant
      chemotherapy. All samples were enriched by density gradient centrifugation. CTC
      positivity was defined by over-expression of at least one gene as compared to the
      healthy control group. RESULTS: CTC were detected in 24.5% of the baseline and
      20.4% of the follow-up samples, of which two thirds were identified by
      overexpression of the cyclophilin C gene (PPIC), and just a few by EpCAM
      overexpression. The presence of CTCs at baseline correlated with the presence of 
      ascites, sub-optimal debulking, and elevated CA-125 and HE-4 levels, whereas CTC 
      during follow-up occurred more often in older and platinum resistant patients.
      PPIC positive CTCs during follow-up were significantly more often detected in the
      platinum resistant than in the platinum sensitive patient group, and indicated
      poor outcome independent from classical prognostic parameters. CONCLUSIONS:
      Molecular characterization of CTC is superior to a mere CTC enumeration or even
      be the rationale for CTC diagnostics at all. Ultimately CTC diagnostics may lead 
      to more personalized treatment of EOC, especially in the recurrent situation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2-3 (CIN2-3) are usually
      treated by cone excision, although only 30% progress to cancer and 6-50% regress 
      spontaneously. Biomarkers predicting CIN2-3 regression would be of great clinical
      value and could reduce unnecessary cone excision and associated complications.
      The aim of this study was to investigate whether punch-biopsy derived
      immunohistochemical biomarkers, local immune response, CIN lesion size and condom
      use are independently correlated to regression of CIN2-3. METHODS: A prospective 
      population-based cohort study of 162 women aged 25-40, with first-time onset
      diagnosis of CIN2-3 in colposcopy-directed biopsies was carried out. The median
      biopsy-cone interval was 16 weeks. Regression was defined as CIN1 or less in the 
      cone biopsy. RESULTS: The regression rate was 21% (34/162). pRb>30% in the lower 
      epithelial half was the strongest predictor for regression (30% regression,
      p<0.0001). If additionally a CIN-lesion was smaller than 2.5mm and CD4+ lymphoid 
      cells in the subepithelial stroma </= 195 per 1.04 mm basal membrane, the
      regression rate was 53%. In CIN-lesions>2.5mm and CD4+-stroma </=195, consistent 
      condom use increased the regression rate from 13% to 67% (p=0.003). If pRb was
      </=30%, the regression rate was low (6%). CONCLUSION: Biomarkers and CIN lesion
      length can predict CIN2-3 regression, and might be helpful to identify patients
      who can increase the regression rate of CIN lesions by consistent condom use.

TI  - MiR-135a promotes growth and invasion of colorectal cancer via metastasis
      suppressor 1 in vitro.
PG  - 838-46
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that participate in the
      spatiotemporal regulation of messenger RNA and protein synthesis. Aberrant miRNA 
      expression leads to developmental abnormalities and diseases. The miR-135a is
      considered to be oncogenic; however, the functions and mechanisms of miR-135a in 
      colorectal cancer (CRC) are largely unknown. Thus, we investigated the functions 
      and mechanisms of miR-135a, especially its relationship with the metastasis
      suppressor 1 (MTSS1) gene in CRC. The expression of miR-135a was determined by
      real-time polymerase chain reaction, while its effect on cell proliferation,
      migration, and invasion was determined by MTT, without and with matrigel,
      respectively. The expression of MTSS1 was detected by western blot analysis. It
      was found that miR-135a expression was higher in human CRC samples than in
      non-tumor control tissue. Using SW480 and SW620 CRC cell lines, increased
      proliferation was observed in response to miR-135a. We also demonstrated that
      miR-135a promoted mobility and invasion via transwell assay with and without
      Matrigel, respectively, of CRC cells. In contrast, inhibition of miR-135a reduced
      their proliferative and invasive capability. MTSS1 was identified as a candidate 
      target gene of miR-135a by luciferase report assay. Western blot analysis showed 
      that the expression of MTSS1 was regulated by miR-135a overexpression and
      knockdown. Similarly, miR-135a-mediated cell mobility and invasion were reduced
      after MTSS1 was knocked down by small interfering RNA. These data indicated that 
      miR-135a promotes the growth and invasion of CRC cells, at least partially,
      through targeting MTSS1.

AB  - PURPOSE: A barrier to the acceptance of active surveillance for men with prostate
      cancer is the risk of underestimating the cancer burden on initial biopsy. We
      assessed the value of endorectal magnetic resonance imaging in predicting
      upgrading on confirmatory biopsy in men with low risk prostate cancer. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: A total of 388 consecutive men (mean age 60.6 years, range 33 to 89)
      with clinically low risk prostate cancer (initial biopsy Gleason score 6 or less,
      prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml, clinical stage T2a or less)
      underwent endorectal magnetic resonance imaging before confirmatory biopsy. Three
      radiologists independently and retrospectively scored tumor visibility on
      endorectal magnetic resonance imaging using a 5-point scale (1-definitely no
      tumor to 5-definitely tumor). Inter-reader agreement was assessed with weighted
      kappa statistics. Associations between magnetic resonance imaging scores and
      confirmatory biopsy findings were evaluated using measures of diagnostic
      performance and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: On confirmatory
      biopsy, Gleason score was upgraded in 79 of 388 (20%) patients. Magnetic
      resonance imaging scores of 2 or less had a high negative predictive value
      (0.96-1.0) and specificity (0.95-1.0) for upgrading on confirmatory biopsy. A
      magnetic resonance imaging score of 5 was highly sensitive for upgrading on
      confirmatory biopsy (0.87-0.98). At multivariate analysis patients with higher
      magnetic resonance imaging scores were more likely to have disease upgraded on
      confirmatory biopsy (odds ratio 2.16-3.97). Inter-reader agreement and diagnostic
      performance were higher for the more experienced readers (kappa 0.41-0.61, AUC
      0.76-0.79) than for the least experienced reader (kappa 0.15-0.39, AUC
      0.61-0.69). Magnetic resonance imaging performed similarly in predicting low risk
      and very low risk (Gleason score 6, less than 3 positive cores, less than 50%
      involvement in all cores) prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Adding endorectal
      magnetic resonance imaging to the initial clinical evaluation of men with
      clinically low risk prostate cancer helps predict findings on confirmatory biopsy
      and assess eligibility for active surveillance.

TI  - Different effects of carbon ion beams and X-rays on clonogenic survival and DNA

AB  - PURPOSE: The effects of a carbon ion beam and X-rays on human pancreatic cancer
      stem-like cells were examined from the point of view of clonogenic survival and
      DNA repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human pancreatic cancer stem-like cells were
      treated with and without carbon ion and X-ray irradiation, and then colony,
      spheroid and tumor formation assays as well as gammaH2AX foci formation assay
      were performed. RESULTS: The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values of a 
      carbon ion beam relative to X-ray for the MIA PaCa-2 and BxPc-3 cells at the D10 
      values were 1.85-2.10. The ability for colony, spheroid formation, and
      tumorigenicity from cancer stem-like CD44(+)/CD24(+) cells is significantly
      higher than that from non-cancer stem-like CD44(-)/CD24(-)cells. FACS data showed
      that CD44(+)/CD24(+) cells were more highly enriched after X-rays compared to
      carbon ion irradiation at isoeffective doses. The RBE values for the carbon ion
      beam relative to X-ray at the D10 levels for CD44(+)/CD24(+) cells were 2.0-2.19.
      The number of gammaH2AX foci in CD44(-)/CD24(-) cells was higher than that of
      CD44(+)/CD24(+) cells after irradiation with either X-ray or carbon ion beam. The
      number of gammaH2AX foci in CD44(+)/CD24(+) cells was almost the same in the
      early time, but it persists significantly longer in carbon ion beam irradiated
      cells compared to X-rays. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon ion beam has superior potential to 
      kill pancreatic cancer stem cell-like cells, and prolonged induction of DNA
      damage might be one of the pivotal mechanisms of its high radiobiological effects
      compared to X-rays.

AB  - Antiangiogenesis is an efficient therapy for eliminating colon cancers, but
      because of recurrence it remains only palliative. We hypothesized that certain
      populations of tumor cells resist antiangiogenesis-induced apoptosis and explored
      the underlying mechanism. We demonstrated that the CD133(+) population of cells
      in colon cancer is resistant to anti-angiogenesis therapy. Additionally, we
      identified an anti-apoptotic signaling pathway responsible for this resistance
      involving PP2A, p38MAPK, MAPKAPK2, and Hsp27. Thus, this pathway may offer a new 
      avenue to develop target therapy for colorectal cancer.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a non-invasive treatment modality for
      selective destruction of cancer and other diseases and involves the
      colocalization of light, oxygen, and a photosensitizer (PS) to achieve
      photocytotoxicity. Although this therapeutic method has considerably improved the
      quality of life and life expectancy of cancer patients, further advances in
      selectivity and therapeutic efficacy are required to overcome numerous side
      effects related to classical PDT. The application of nanoscale photosensitizers
      (NPSs) comprising molecular PSs and nanocarriers with or without other
      biological/photophysical functions is a promising approach for improving PDT. In 
      this review, we focus on four nanomedical approaches for advanced PDT: (1)
      nanocarriers for targeted delivery of PS, (2) introduction of active targeting
      moieties for disease-specific PDT, (3) stimulus-responsive NPSs for selective
      PDT, and (4) photophysical improvements in NPS for enhanced PDT efficacy.
      HIGHLIGHTS: Conservation of normal tissues demands non-invasive therapeutic
      methods. PDT is a light-activated, non-invasive modality for selective
      destruction of cancers. Success of PDT requires further advances to overcome the 
      limitations of classical PDT. Nanophotosensitizers help improve target
      selectivity and therapeutic efficacy of PDT.

AB  - Breast cancer is a common diagnosis and the majority of women treated will be
      cured. Women with early stage breast cancer may be at increased risk for
      osteoporosis due to anticancer therapies. Chemotherapy induced amenorrhea and the
      use of anti-estrogens can promote bone loss; thus, the management of bone health 
      in women with breast cancer is an important component of survivorship care.
      Osteoporosis is considered a "silent" disease as there are often no discrete
      warning signs, until a fracture occurs; therefore, clinicians must be cognizant
      of the underlying risk for osteoporosis and co-morbid conditions and/or
      medications that accelerate risk of fracture. Breast cancer therapies that effect
      bone, screening for bone loss and interventions to mitigate the treatment
      toxicities are reviewed.

AB  - The preferred treatment for lung cancer is surgery if the disease is considered
      resectable and the patient is considered surgically fit. Preoperative smoking
      cessation and/or preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation might improve
      postoperative outcomes after lung cancer surgery. The objectives of this
      systematic review were to determine the effectiveness of (1) preoperative smoking
      cessation and (2) preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation on peri- and
      postoperative outcomes in patients who undergo resection for lung cancer. We
      searched MEDLINE, PreMedline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Cinahl, BNI, Psychinfo,
      Amed, Web of Science (SCI and SSCI), and Biomed Central. Original studies
      published in English investigating the effect of preoperative smoking cessation
      or preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation on operative and longer-term outcomes in
      >/= 50 patients who received surgery with curative intent for lung cancer were
      included. Of the 7 included studies that examined the effect of preoperative
      smoking cessation (n = 6) and preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation (n = 1) on
      outcomes after lung cancer surgery, none were randomized controlled trials and
      only 1 was prospective. The studies used different smoking classifications, the
      baseline characteristics differed between the study groups in some of the
      studies, and most had small sample sizes. No formal data synthesis was therefore 
      possible. The included studies were marked by methodological limitations. On the 
      basis of the reported bodies of evidence, it is not possible to make any firm
      conclusions about the effect of preoperative smoking cessation or of preoperative
      pulmonary rehabilitation on operative outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for
      lung cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of an 8-week aquatic program on
      cancer-related fatigue, as well as physical and psychological outcomes in breast 
      cancer survivors. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Outpatient
      clinic, urban, academic medical center, and a sport university swimming pool.
      PARTICIPANTS: Breast cancer survivors (N=68) were randomly assigned to either an 
      experimental (aquatic exercise group in deep water pool) group or a control
      (usual care) group. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group attended aquatic
      exercise sessions 3 times per week for 8 weeks in a heated deep swimming pool.
      Sessions lasted 60 minutes in duration: 10 minutes of warm-up, 40 minutes of
      aerobic and endurance exercises, and 10 minutes of cool-down exercises. Patients 
      allocated to the usual care group followed the oncologist's recommendations in
      relation to a healthy lifestyle. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Values for fatigue (Piper
      Fatigue Scale), mood state (Profile of Mood States), and abdominal (trunk curl
      static endurance test) and leg (multiple sit-to-stand test) strength were
      collected at baseline, after the last treatment session, and at a 6-month
      follow-up. RESULTS: Immediately after discharge, the aquatic exercise group
      showed a large effect size in total fatigue score (d=.87; 95% confidence
      interval, .48-1.26), trunk curl endurance (d=.92; 95% confidence interval,
      1.97-3.83), and leg strength (d=1.10; .55-2.76), but negligible effects in vigor,
      confusion, and disturbance of mood (d<.25). At the 6-month follow-up period, the 
      aquatic exercise group maintained large to small effect sizes in fatigue scores, 
      multiple sit-to-stand test, and trunk curl static endurance (.25>d>.90) and
      negligible effects for the fatigue-severity dimension and different scales of the
      Profile of Mood States (d<.25). CONCLUSION: An aquatic exercise program conducted
      in deep water was effective for improving cancer-related fatigue and strength in 
      breast cancer survivors.

AB  - Sp1 is a transcription factor regulating many genes through its DNA binding
      domain, containing three zinc fingers. We were interested in identifying target
      genes regulated by Sp1, particularly those involved in proliferation and cancer. 
      Our approach was to treat HeLa cells with a siRNA directed against Sp1 mRNA to
      decrease the expression of Sp1 and, in turn, the genes activated by this
      transcription factor. Sp1-siRNA treatment led to a great number of differentially
      expressed genes as determined by whole genome cDNA microarray analysis.
      Underexpressed genes were selected since they represent putative genes activated 
      by Sp1 and classified in six Gene Onthology categories, namely proliferation and 
      cancer, mRNA processing, lipid metabolism, glucidic metabolism, transcription and
      translation. Putative Sp1 binding sites were found in the promoters of the
      selected genes using the Match software. After literature mining, 11 genes were
      selected for further validation. Underexpression by qRT-PCR was confirmed for the
      11 genes plus Sp1 in HeLa cells after Sp1-siRNA treatment. EMSA and ChIP assays
      were performed to test for binding of Sp1 to the promoters of these genes. We
      observed binding of Sp1 to the promoters of RAB20, FGF21, IHPK2, ARHGAP18, NPM3, 
      SRSF7, CALM3, PGD and Sp1 itself. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of RAB20, FGF21
      and IHPK2 and luciferase activity for these three genes related to proliferation 
      and cancer, were determined after overexpression of Sp1 in HeLa cells, to confirm
      their regulation by Sp1. Involvement of these three genes in proliferation was
      validated by gene silencing using polypurine reverse hoogsteen hairpins.

AB  - Inhibitors of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone are showing promise as anti-cancer
      agents. Here we describe a series of 4-aryl-5-cyanopyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine ATP
      competitive Hsp90 inhibitors that were identified following structure-driven
      optimization of purine hits revealed by NMR based screening of a proprietary
      fragment library. Ligand-Hsp90 X-ray structures combined with molecular modeling 
      led to the rational displacement of a conserved water molecule leading to
      enhanced affinity for Hsp90 as measured by fluorescence polarization, isothermal 
      titration calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance assays. This displacement was
      achieved with a nitrile group, presenting an example of efficient gain in binding
      affinity with minimal increase in molecular weight. Some compounds in this
      chemical series inhibit the proliferation of human cancer cell lines in vitro and
      cause depletion of oncogenic Hsp90 client proteins and concomitant elevation of
      the co-chaperone Hsp70. In addition, one compound was demonstrated to be orally
      bioavailable in the mouse. This work demonstrates the power of structure-based
      design for the rapid evolution of potent Hsp90 inhibitors and the importance of
      considering conserved water molecules in drug design.

AB  - Three series of novel heterocyclic azoles derivatives containing pyrazine (5a-5k,
      8a-8k and 11a-11k) have been designed, synthesized, structurally determined, and 
      their biological activities were evaluated as potential telomerase inhibitors.
      Among the oxadiazole derivatives, compound 5c showed the most potent biological
      activity against SW1116 cancer cell line (IC(50)=2.46 muM against SW1116 and
      IC(50)=3.55 muM for telomerase). Compound 8h performed the best in the
      thiadiazole derivatives (IC(50)=0.78 muM against HEPG2 and IC(50)=1.24 muM for
      telomerase), which was comparable to the positive control. While compound 11f
      showed the most potent biological activity (IC(50)=4.12 muM against SW1116 and
      IC(50)=15.03 muM for telomerase) among the triazole derivatives. Docking
      simulation by positioning compounds 5c, 8h and 11f into the telomerase structure 
      active site was performed to explore the possible binding model. The results of
      apoptosis demonstrated that compound 8h possessed good antitumor activity against
      HEPG2 cancer cell line. Therefore, compound 8h with potent inhibitory activity in
      tumor growth inhibition may be a potential antitumor agent against HEPG2 cancer
      cell. Therefore, the introduction of oxadiazole, thiadiazole and triazole
      structures reinforced the combination of our compounds and the receptor,
      resulting in progress of bioactivity.

AB  - Since 2007, the preparation of cancer drugs at the Pharmacy of the University
      Hospital of Ancona has been progressively robotized. Currently, the process of
      preparation of intravenous cancer drugs is almost totally automated (95%). At
      present, the Cytotoxic laboratory of Ancona is the sole, in Europe, that can
      count on two robots. The robots handle 56 oncology molecules, which correspond to
      more than 160 different vials. The production rate in 2011 exceeded 19,000
      preparations. The quality of compounding and the sterility controls are
      satisfactory, every step of the process is traceable. The nursing staff played a 
      fundamental role in the robot development process. The nursing staff and the
      pharmacists are still collaborating with the robotic engineers in order to
      increase efficiency, ergonomics and user-friendliness of the robots.

TI  - Effects of a self-care education program on quality of life after surgery in
      patients with esophageal cancer.
PG  - 332-40
AB  - In recent years, the number of quality-of-life (QOL) studies on patients with
      esophageal cancer has increased; however, the number of studies related to the
      effects of self-care education programs on QOL of these patients is scarce. This 
      article reports on the effects of a self-care education program on QOL for
      patients with esophageal cancer in Babol, Iran. The quasi-experimental study had 
      a convenience sample of 105 patients with esophageal cancer referred to oncology 
      centers in Babol City. A quasi-random allocation technique was used to divide the
      sample into experimental (n = 55) and control (n = 50) groups. Appropriate
      instruments were used to measure QOL (European Organization for Research and
      Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-30 and Quality of Life
      Questionnaire-Oesophageal 18). Questionnaires were completed by the respondents
      before and 3 months after implementing the educational program that consisted of 
      group discussion, lectures, and pamphlets. There was no significant difference
      between QOL mean score of both groups before the intervention; however, after
      implementing the educational program, the QOL significantly improved in the
      experimental group (p = .001), whereas QOL decreased in the controls. We conclude
      that self-care education programs have positive effects on the QOL of patients
      with esophageal cancer. Planning and implementing such self-care education
      programs, when patients are under treatment, can help them improve their QOL.

AB  - Identification of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (PTP) substrates is critical in
      understanding cellular role in normal cells as well as cancer cells. We have
      previously shown that reduction of PTPL1 protein levels in Ewings sarcoma (ES)
      inhibit cell growth and tumorigenesis. Therefore, we sought to identify novel
      PTPL1 substrates that may be important for tumorigenesis. In this current work,
      we demonstrated that mouse embryonic fibroblasts without PTPL1 catalytic activity
      fail to form foci when transfected with oncogenes. We proved that catalytic
      activity of PTPL1 is important for ES cell growth. Using a substrate-trapping
      mutant of PTPL1 we identified putative PTPL1 substrates by mass-spectrometry. One
      of these putative substrates was characterized as Valosin Containing Protein
      (VCP/p97). Using multiple biochemical assays we validated VCP as a novel
      substrate of PTPL1. We also provide evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation of VCP
      might be important for its midbody localization during cytokinesis. In
      conclusion, our work identifies VCP as a new substrate for PTPL1, which may be
      important in cellular transformation. Our investigation link an oncogenic
      transcription factor EWS-FLI1, with a key transcriptional target protein tyrosine
      phosphatase PTPL1, and its substrate VCP. Given our observation that PTPL1
      catalytic activity is important for cell transformation, our results may also
      suggest that VCP regulation by PTPL1 might be important for tumorigenesis.

TI  - ATF5 is overexpressed in epithelial ovarian carcinomas and interference with its

AB  - The activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) is highly expressed in many kinds of
      tumors including glioblastoma and breast cancers, but its expression in
      epithelial ovarian neoplasms has not been investigated. Here, we show that ATF5
      is highly expressed in the majority of epithelial ovarian cancer samples (43/60) 
      as compared with benign ovarian tumor tissues (4/13) and normal ovarian tissues
      (1/10). Furthermore, we found that ATF5 expression significantly correlated with 
      advanced clinical stage (P<0.05) and poor differentiation of epithelial ovarian
      carcinomas (P<0.05). Previous studies suggested that ATF5 is required for the
      survival of cancer cells, but the mechanisms by which ATF5 regulates genes and
      promotes cell survival are not clear. Our data additionally demonstrated that
      interference with the function of ATF5 could markedly increase the apoptosis of
      ovarian cancer cells and identified B-cell leukemia lymphoma-2 as an
      ATF5-targeted apoptosis-related gene. These findings may provide potential
      therapeutic application in epithelial ovarian cancer.

TI  - Immunohistochemical localization of HE4 in benign, borderline, and malignant
      lesions of the ovary.
PG  - 517-23
LID - 10.1097/PGP.0b013e31824fe269 [doi]
AB  - Despite advances in the development of novel methods to improve treatment,
      ovarian carcinoma is still the leading cause of gynecologic cancer death in the
      United States and other industrialized nations. Improvements in the clinical
      outcome of ovarian cancer will be achieved if methods can be developed to enable 
      the detection of these tumors at the earliest possible stage. Thus, it is
      critically important to identify and validate new biomarkers of ovarian cancer.
      HE4 expression was defined by immunohistochemical analysis of a wide range of
      benign, borderline, and malignant ovarian lesions, including serous,
      endometrioid, mucinous, and clear cell lesions of the ovary and in primary tubal 
      carcinomas and the normal fallopian tube. At the cellular level, HE4 was highly
      expressed in malignant ovarian tumors and in a wide range of benign and
      borderline ovarian lesions. In addition, HE4 was highly expressed in primary
      fallopian tube carcinomas and benign fallopian tubal epithelial cells. These
      results support the conclusion that HE4 is widely expressed in most benign,
      borderline, and malignant lesions of the ovary and the fallopian tube. The
      detection of HE4 expression at high levels in some benign lesions and normal
      tissues suggests that HE4 could have limited specificity as a marker of ovarian
      or tubal carcinoma. Furthermore, the relatively weak expression that was observed
      in many ovarian carcinomas indicates that HE4 could fail to detect some cases of 
      primary or recurrent disease.

TI  - The NAD metabolome--a key determinant of cancer cell biology.
PG  - 741-52
LID - 10.1038/nrc3340 [doi]
AB  - NAD is a vital molecule in all organisms. It is a key component of both energy
      and signal transduction--processes that undergo crucial changes in cancer cells. 
      NAD(+)-dependent signalling pathways are many and varied, and they regulate
      fundamental events such as transcription, DNA repair, cell cycle progression,
      apoptosis and metabolism. Many of these processes have been linked to cancer
      development. Given that NAD(+)-dependent signalling reactions involve the
      degradation of the molecule, permanent nucleotide resynthesis through different
      biosynthetic pathways is crucial for incessant cancer cell proliferation. This
      necessity supports the targeting of NAD metabolism as a new therapeutic concept
      for cancer treatment.

      metastasis of gastric adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 1439-48
LID - 10.14670/HH-27.1439 [doi]
AB  - With increasing therapeutic use of minimally invasive therapy for treatment of
      early gastric cancer, prediction of lymph node metastasis is important. In search
      of tissue biomarkers for prediction of lymph node metastasis of gastric
      adenocarcinoma, we analyzed gastric adenocarcinoma tissue using proteomic
      methods. We have done 2D-PAGE and MALDI-TOF MS analysis in matched normal and
      gastric cancer tissues. We also evaluated the clinicopathological significance of
      expression of S100A8 and S100A9 in gastric adenocarcinoma using a tissue
      microarray of 218 gastric adenocarcinoma specimens. Cell invasion and migration
      assay were performed to confirm functional role of S100A8 and S100A9 using small 
      hairpin RNA lentivirus. We identified 8 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated
      proteins in gastric cancer tissues compared to matched normal mucosa. Of these,
      expression of S100A8 and S100A9 occurred mainly in stromal cells and inflammatory
      cells between tumor cells. Correlation was observed between small lesion size,
      decreased depth of invasion, a tendency to absence of lymphovascular tumor
      emboli, a decrease in perineural invasion and lymph node metastasis, and
      expression of stromal S100A8. In addition, increased expression of stromal S100A9
      in gastric adenocarcinoma was associated with small lesion size and a decrease in
      lymph node metastasis. Functional analysis confirmed that down-regulation of
      S100A8 and S100A9 by small hairpin RNA lentivirus induced an increase of
      migration and invasion in gastric cancer cell lines. Taken together, these
      findings suggest that S100A8 and S100A9 are negative regulators of lymph node
      metastasis of gastric adenocarcinoma and can be used as biomarkers for prediction
      of lymph node metastasis in gastric adenocarcinoma.

TI  - First-line bevacizumab-based therapy in advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung
      cancer : analysis of the Italian patients enrolled in the SAiL study.
PG  - 755-60
LID - 10.1007/s40261-012-0001-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: First-line bevacizumab-based therapy has been shown to 
      improve outcomes in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). The recent international phase IV SAiL study (a Study of Avastin 
      [bevacizumab] in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy in patients
      with advanced or recurrent non-squamous cell Lung cancer) evaluated the safety
      and efficacy of bevacizumab combined with standard chemotherapy regimens in
      routine clinical practice. Here we report the results of a subanalysis of
      baseline characteristics and efficacy data for Italian patients enrolled in SAiL.
      METHODS: In the SAiL study, patients with untreated locally advanced, metastatic 
      or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC received bevacizumab (7.5 or 15 mg/kg) every 3
      weeks plus chemotherapy for up to six cycles, followed by single-agent
      bevacizumab until disease progression. Efficacy was assessed in terms of time to 
      disease progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The Italian
      intent-to-treat population comprised 215 patients from a SAiL population of 2212 
      patients. At baseline, Italian patients tended to have less advanced disease than
      the overall population. Thus, the proportion of patients at enrollment with
      tumour stage IIIb and IV was 23.7 and 76.3 %, respectively, for the Italian
      population versus 19.7 and 80.3 % for the whole SAiL population. In addition, a
      higher proportion of Italian patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
      performance status of 0 (72.6 vs. 37.2 %) and the prevalence of co-morbid
      conditions was lower in Italian patients (59.5 % of Italian patients reported a
      co-morbid condition and 60.0 % were receiving non-oncological treatment compared 
      with 73.3 and 73.4 %, respectively, of SAiL patients overall). The mean exposures
      to bevacizumab and to chemotherapy were comparable between the Italian patient
      group and overall patient population, although cisplatin doublets were more
      commonly employed in Italian patients whereas carboplatin doublets were more
      commonly employed in the overall SAiL population. The median TTP and OS times for
      Italian and SAiL populations were comparable (TTP, 7.8 months vs. 7.8 months; OS,
      14.8 months vs. 14.6 months). CONCLUSION: The results of this subanalysis of the 
      SAiL study of bevacizumab treatment in routine clinical practice suggest that
      Italian oncologists tend to prescribe bevacizumab to a selected population of
      patients with less advanced disease than is the case in the overall population.
      Nevertheless, the first-line use of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy 
      offers clinical benefits to Italian patients with advanced or recurrent
      non-squamous NSCLC.

TI  - Detecting of breast cancer metastasis by means of regional lymph node sampling
      during autologous breast reconstruction--a screening of 519 consecutive patients.
PG  - CR605-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: The internal mammary artery and vein is often used as a site of
      anastomoses in microvascular breast reconstruction. This area supports lymphatic 
      drainage of the breast and its role in breast cancer metastasis remains unclear. 
      We hypothesize that sampling of internal mammary lymph nodes at the time of
      microvascular anastomoses preparation may identify persistent or recurrent local 
      disease and mandate the need for additional treatment in this area.
      MATERIAL/METHODS: A retrospective chart review from 519 patients in the time
      between January 2006 and September 2009 was performed on all patients who
      underwent internal mammary lymph node sampling at the time of microvascular
      breast reconstruction. RESULTS: Microvascular breast reconstruction was performed
      in 519 patients. Enlarged internal mammary lymph nodes were found and harvested
      in 195 patients for histological review. Six of 195 (3.08%) were found positive
      for metastatic disease requiring additional oncologic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The
      internal mammary lymphatic drainage system is an important and often
      underappreciated pathway for breast metastasis. Routine sampling of these lymph
      nodes at the time of microvascular breast reconstruction is easy to perform and
      is a useful tool to identify women, who might require additional treatment and
      increase cancer-free survival.

AB  - The objective of this integrative review is to analyze the scientific production 
      addressing the sexuality of women with breast cancer following mastectomy,
      focused on the effects that the physical discomfort due to cancer treatments have
      on their sex life. The search included articles published in the period between
      2000 and 2009 on the MEDLINE, LILACS and PsycINFO databases, using the following 
      descriptors: mastectomy, breast neoplasms, sexuality, sexual behavior,
      amputation, psychosexual development, and marital relations. Nine articles were
      selected, which addressed the effects of the physical discomfort from cancer
      treatments on the patients' sexuality. The findings revealed that, even when the 
      patient's sex life is intense and fulfilling before the disease, factors such as 
      stress, pain, fatigue, insult to body image, and low self-esteem due to the
      treatments may alter the sexual functioning of the affected woman. Healthcare
      professionals must be sensitized in order to welcome and include the topic in
      policies as well as in preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Male urinary incontinence has been related to several factors, among which benign
      prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer treatment are highlighted. Urinary
      incontinence has negative effects on patients as well as on their relatives and
      caregivers. In the present study, an integrative review was performed with the
      purpose to identify the impact that urinary incontinence has on the lives of the 
      patients' partners. The article survey was performed on the following databases: 
      CINAHL, EMBASE, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, and PubMed. Articles were included if they were 
      written in Portuguese, English or Spanish, and excluded if they did not mention
      the patients' wives. The final sample was comprised of 15 articles from seven
      countries. The articles were distributed into the following categories:
      Psychological Distress, Fatigue, Change in Sex Life, and Limitations on Social
      Life. The category Psychological Distress was present in all articles and was
      rated as having the most impact on these women's lives.

TI  - Covalent modification of reduced graphene oxide by means of diazonium chemistry
      and use as a drug-delivery system.
PG  - 14708-16
LID - 10.1002/chem.201200843 [doi]
AB  - Under acidic conditions, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was functionalized with
      p-aminobenzoic acid, which formed the diazonium ions through the diazotization
      with a wet-chemical method. Surfactants or stabilizers were not applied during
      the diazotization. After the functionalized rGO was treated through mild
      sonication in aqueous solution, these functionalized rGO sheets were less than
      two layers, which was determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. The
      water solubility of functionalized rGO after the introduction of
      polyethyleneimine (PEI) was improved significantly; it was followed by covalent
      binding of folic acid (FA) molecules to the functionalized rGO to allow us to
      specifically target CBRH7919 cancer cells by using FA as a receptor. The loading 
      and release behaviors of elsinochrome A (EA) and doxorubicin (DOX) on the
      functionalized rGO sheets were investigated. The EA loading ratio onto
      rGO-C(6)H(4)-CO-NH-PEI-NH-CO-FA (abbreviated rGO-PEI-FA, the weight ratio of drug
      loaded onto rGO-PEI-FA) was approximately 45.56 %, and that of DOX was
      approximately 28.62 %. It was interesting that the drug release from rGO-PEI-FA
      was pH- and salt-dependent. The results of cytotoxicity
      (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow
      cytometry (FCM) assays, as well as cell morphology observations) clearly showed
      that the concentration of rGO-PEI-FA as the drug-delivery composite should be
      less than 12.5 mg L(-1). The conjugation of DOX and rGO-PEI-FA can enhance the
      cancer-cell apoptosis effectively and can also push the cancer cells to the
      vulnerable G2 phase of the cell cycle, which is most sensitive and susceptible to
      damage by drugs or radiation.

TI  - Human papillomavirus genotyping, human papillomavirus mRNA expression, and
      p16/Ki-67 cytology to detect anal cancer precursors in HIV-infected MSM.
PG  - 2185-92
LID - 10.1097/QAD.0b013e328359f255 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Anal cancer incidence is high in HIV-infected MSM. Screening for anal 
      intraepithelial lesions and cancers is performed at specialized clinics and
      relies on high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) and anal cytology. Both approaches have 
      limited reproducibility and sensitivity for detecting anal cancer precursors. We 
      evaluated biomarkers for human papillomavirus (HPV)-related disease in a
      population of HIV-infected MSM. METHODS: A cross-sectional screening study with
      passive follow-up included 363 MSM followed at a HIV/AIDS clinic. All men had
      anal cytology samples taken and were evaluated using HRA and anal biopsies. Using
      a composite endpoint of biopsy results and cytology, we compared the performance 
      of HPV16/18 genotyping, HPVE6/E7 mRNA expression, and p16/Ki-67 cytology to
      detect high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasias (AINs). RESULTS: For all
      biomarkers analyzed, there was a significant trend of increasing percentage of
      men testing positive with increasing severity of disease (P < 0.001). HPV DNA
      testing had the highest sensitivity for anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2
      and anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (AIN3), followed by p16/Ki-67,
      HPVE6/E7 mRNA testing, and HPV16/18 genotyping. The highest Youden's index was
      observed for HPVE6/E7 mRNA testing, followed by HPV16/18 genotyping, p16/Ki-67
      cytology, and HPV DNA testing. Increasing the threshold for positivity of
      p16/Ki-67 to five or more positive cells led to significantly higher specificity,
      but unchanged sensitivity for detecting AIN3. CONCLUSION: Molecular features of
      anal disease categories are similar to those of corresponding cervical lesions.
      Biomarkers evaluated for cervical cancer screening may be used for primary anal
      cancer screening or to decide who should require immediate treatment vs.
      expectant management.

      metastasis of breast cancer cells.
PG  - 4258-65
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1101855 [doi]
AB  - Elevated levels of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) have been reported in
      breast cancer patients, but the significance remains undefined. Using three
      immunocompetent mouse models of breast cancer bone metastasis, we identified a
      key role for pDC in facilitating tumor growth through immunosuppression and
      aggressive osteolysis. Following infiltration of macrophages upon breast cancer
      dissemination, there was a steady increase in pDC within the bone, which resulted
      in a sustained Th2 response along with elevated levels of regulatory T cells and 
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Subsequently, pDC and CD4(+) T cells, producing
      osteolytic cytokines, increased with tumor burden, causing severe bone damage.
      Microcomputed tomography and histology analyses of bone showed destruction of
      femur and tibia. The therapeutic significance of this finding was confirmed by
      depletion of pDC, which resulted in decreased tumor burden and bone loss by
      activating tumor-specific cytolytic CD8(+) T cells and decreasing suppressor cell
      populations. Thus, pDC depletion may offer a novel adjuvant strategy to
      therapeutically influence breast cancer bone metastasis.

      nutraceuticals combination (AP=Berberine+Red Yeast Rice) on dyslipidemia which
      frequently persists after life style changes in patients on hormone-therapy
      following breast cancer (HT-BC). METHODS: Twenty-one HT-BC patients, free of
      tumor, mean age 59.9 years, BMI 28,9 kg/m2, waist circumference 95.9 cm, with
      altered lipid profile (total cholesterol 269.0 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein
      (HDL) cholesterol 54.9 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 184.0
      mg/dL, and triglycerides 263.3 mg/dL) were recruited. They were recommended a
      3-month period of diet followed by a 3-month period of treatment with AP 1
      tablet/day. AP tablets contain berberine 500 mg, red yeast rice extract 200 mg
      (equivalent to 3 mg monacolins), policosanol 10 mg, folic acid 0.2 mg, coenzyme
      Q10 2 mg, and asthaxantin 0.5 mg. RESULTS: The lipid profile was significantly
      improved by AP vs. diet: 1.8% decrease in total cholesterol on diet and a further
      15.3% decrease with AP vs. diet (P<0.001); a 3.1% decrease in LDL cholesterol
      after diet and an 18.9% decrease after AP treatment vs diet alone (P<0.01); a
      2.3% decrease in triglycerides after diet alone and a 36.5% decrease after AP vs.
      diet (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Adequate life style therapy is effective in reducing, 
      but not in normalizing, the lipid profile in patients on hormone-therapy
      following breast cancer. The use of natural nutraceuticals as AP, combined with
      diet, leads to a good therapeutic response and optimal acceptance by the
      patients.

TI  - Preimplant factors affecting prostate D90 after transperineal interstitial
      prostate brachytherapy with loose (125)I seeds.
PG  - 89-94
AB  - The dose received by 90% of the prostate volume (D90) is the key parameter of
      dosimetric analysis in prostate brachytherapy. The aim of this analysis was to
      identify preimplant factors affecting prostate D90 after transperineal
      interstitial prostate brachytherapy with loose (125)I seeds. We reviewed the
      records of 210 patients who underwent transperineal interstitial prostate
      brachytherapy with loose (125)I seeds for clinical T1/T2 prostate cancer at our
      institution. Patients who received supplemental external-beam radiation therapy
      were excluded. One hundred and nine patients (51.9%) received neoadjuvant
      hormonal therapy (NHT). One month after seed implantation, postimplant computed
      tomography and dosimetric analysis were performed. Univariate and multivariate
      analyses were carried out to identify preimplant factors affecting postimplant
      prostate D90. The postimplant prostate D90 values ranged from 123.3 to 234.1 Gy
      (mean +/- standard error, 177.1 +/- 1.4 Gy). Postimplant prostate D90 differed
      significantly between patients who had and had not undergone NHT (P = 0.001). In 
      addition, simple regression analyses showed positive correlations with the
      estimated preimplant prostate D90, preimplant prostate volume by transrectal
      ultrasound (TRUS), total radioactivity, number of needles, and number of seeds.
      On stepwise multiple regression analysis, postimplant prostate D90 showed
      significant negative correlations with NHT and preimplant prostate volume by
      TRUS, and a significant positive correlation with total radioactivity. In
      conclusion, NHT, preimplant prostate volume by TRUS, and total radioactivity are 
      significant preimplant factors affecting postimplant prostate D90 in prostate
      cancer patients treated with transperineal interstitial prostate brachytherapy
      with loose (125)I seeds.

TI  - [Understanding of patients suffering from gastroenterologic incurable disease:
      perspective of celebrities' embracement].
PG  - 155-61
AB  - Diagnosis and treatment of gastroenterologic disease have been progressed after
      twentieth century. Now days a lot of diseases, which were called incurable
      diseases before have been treated or managed successfully. But, there are still
      many incurable diseases left, including advanced cancer and inflammatory bowel
      disease in gastroenterology. Here we reviewed some cases of celebrities'
      gastroenterologic incurable diseases. We hoped to widen our understandings of
      those diseases and give opportunities for the better treatment. Embracements of
      patients suffering from gastroenterologic incurable diseases were diverse. We can
      find out they ended their lives doing the most precious things. Among them, the
      love for their family members were the most universal and important concerns. We 
      hope the patients suffering from gastroenterologic incurable diseases can have
      more opportunities for better treatments and to be understood in their
      situations.

TI  - A case of breast cancer in a male patient with cryptogenic cirrhosis.
PG  - 182-5
AB  - Breast cancer is a rare disease in men. We report a case of 53-year-old obese
      male, with known cryptogenic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, presenting a
      tender mass on left breast. He was diagnosed with invasive intraductal carcinoma,
      which was consistent with a sporadic lesion. On the basis of previous
      literatures, obesity can be regarded as a cause for breast cancer even in men.
      However, there has been inconsistent data about link between liver cirrhosis and 
      male breast cancer, which can be due to heterogenity in the etiology of
      cirrhosis. Through this case, it can be postulated that the risk for male breast 
      cancer may vary according to the etiology of cirrhosis.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptides
      (NT-pro-BNP), cardiac troponin T, and creatinine kinase, MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) in 
      the determination of subclinical left ventricular (LV) dysfunction by
      echocardiography in patients treated with doxorubicin. We performed a
      cross-sectional case study of systolic, diastolic function and tissue Doppler
      imaging by echocardiography in children with cancer who received a certain
      cumulative dose of doxorubicin. Blood levels for NT-pro-BNP, cardiac troponin T, 
      and CK-MB were analyzed within 6 hours of the cardiac study. Of 30 patients, 5
      (16.7%) had LV dysfunction with an abnormally high NT-pro-BNP level of 363 +/- 78
      pg/mL, whereas patients with normal LV function had an NT-pro-BNP level of 148
      +/- 173 pg/mL (P = 0.012). The NT-pro-BNP level not only inversely correlated
      with fractional shortening (r = -0.43, P = 0.017) and ejection fraction (r = -
      0.45, P = 0.013) but also correlated with mitral deceleration time ( r = 0.41, P 
      = 0.021) and a cumulative dose of doxorubicin (r = 0.44, P = 0.014). For tissue
      Doppler imaging, NT-pro-BNP correlated with a peak systolic velocity at the
      myocardial segment (Sm) (r = -0.40, P = 0.027). NT-pro-BNP is a sensitive test
      and has a moderate relationship with the LV systolic and diastolic function, thus
      making it a useful cardiac marker for the monitoring of early anthracycline
      cardiotoxicity.

AB  - A mass screening program using photofluorography has been used as a secondary
      prophylaxis of gastric cancer in Japan. However, we are at a turning point for
      reconsidering the strategy of gastric cancer prevention because of various
      problems with photofluorography. The shift from current secondary prophylaxis to 
      primary prophylaxis is now required. After a Japanese multicenter randomized
      controlled trial showed that Helicobacter pylori eradication reduced the
      incidence of metachronous gastric cancer after endoscopic resection of early
      gastric cancer, primary prophylaxis of gastric cancer has gained greater
      attention. The combination of H. pylori eradication as a primary prophylaxis and 
      screening as a secondary prophylaxis is necessary for the elimination of gastric 
      cancer in Japan. The strategy of test, treat and screening for H. pylori
      infection is effective in reducing the incidence and mortality of gastric cancer 
      in communities with a high incidence of gastric cancer. We have proposed a
      program of risk stratification based on the presence of H. pylori infection with 
      or without atrophic gastritis followed by targeted interventions.

TI  - Psychotherapy for depression among patients with advanced cancer.
PG  - 1113-9
LID - 10.1093/jjco/hys152 [doi]
AB  - Cancer causes profound suffering for patients, and previous reports have
      demonstrated that psychological distress, particularly depression, is frequently 
      observed in advanced and/or terminally ill cancer patients. Such depression can
      lead to serious and far-reaching negative consequences in patients with advanced 
      cancer: reducing their quality of life and causing severe suffering, a desire for
      early death, and suicide, as well as psychological distress in family members.
      For the management of their distress, cancer patients are more likely to prefer
      psychotherapeutic interventions to pharmacotherapy, and psychotherapy is known to
      be effective for the management of depression among advanced cancer patients.
      Hence, psychotherapy is an important treatment strategy for alleviating their
      depression. Furthermore, patients with advanced and/or terminal cancer suffer
      from various physical symptoms and are forced to face a continuous decline in
      physical function. In addition, psychological defense mechanisms such as denial
      are frequently observed in these patients. Hence, an individually tailored and
      careful psychotherapeutic approach should be followed, which considers the
      specific nature of the advanced and/or terminal cancer. This review focuses on
      psychological interventions that can be utilized in the clinical oncology
      practice to ameliorate depression among advanced and/or terminally ill cancer
      patients, rather than focusing on the level of evidence for each intervention. In
      addition, the current review introduces some novel therapeutic strategies that
      have not yet been proved to be effective but show promise for future studies.

AB  - Although interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an important biological mediator playing an
      indispensable role in inflammation and cancer, few inhibitors and suppressors are
      known. In the present study, the underlying mechanisms of a novel chemically
      synthesized compound SK-1009, which has suppressive properties on IL-6 production
      in human macrophage cells, were examined. SK-1009 suppressed IL-6 mRNA levels in 
      human colon cancer cells. Thus, the influence of SK-1009 on transcription factor,
      nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), which is involved in expression of the IL-6
      gene was assessed. SK-1009 was found to suppress degradation of I-kappaB, an
      NF-kappaB inhibitory factor, and consequently inhibited the NF-kappaB activation 
      pathway. The inhibitory property was almost the same as other NF-kappaB
      inhibitors, such as 5HPP-33. Thus, SK-1009 exerts a potent inhibitory effect on
      IL-6 expression, apparently mediated by modulation of activation of NF-kappaB
      transcription factor.

      pancreatic cancer cell lines.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a potential treatment for
      pancreatic cancer. A second-generation photosensitizer,
      2-[1-hexyloxyethyl]-2-devinyl pyropheophorbide (HPPH) has a long wavelength
      absorption, high-tumor selectivity, and shorter duration of skin
      photosensitivity. We investigated the efficacy of PDT with HPPH and gemcitabine
      in inducing cell death in multiple pancreatic cancer cell lines. METHODS: We used
      three pancreatic cancer cell lines (PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2, and BXPC-3) incubated
      with HPPH concentration of 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5
      microg/ml for 6 hours, followed by photoradiation at a light dose of 60 J/cm(2). 
      Afterwards, each cell line was treated with gemcitabine at concentrations of 0,
      1, 10, and 100 microM and incubated for another 96 hours. Cell death was detected
      with SYTOX green staining. We also assessed the difference in cytotoxicity in
      adding gemcitabine before and after PDT. RESULTS: HPPH-PDT can effectively induce
      cell death in all cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, with a 100% of cell
      death at the 0.5 microg/ml HPPH concentration. In contrast, monotherapy with
      gemcitabine alone (100 microM) only achieved <45% cell death. Combining
      gemcitabine to HPPH-PDT resulted in synergistic cytotoxic effect with 20-50% more
      cell death across all cell lines. There was no difference in cytotoxicity in
      adding gemcitabine before or after PDT. CONCLUSION: This is the first study on
      HPPH-PDT for pancreatic cancer. HPPH-PDT-induced cell death occurs in a
      dose-dependent manner. HPPH-PDT and gemcitabine have synergistic effects in
      inducing cell death in multiple pancreatic cancer cell lines.

AB  - Interferons (IFNs) have been investigated as important cytokines in
      immunotherapy. The use of IFNs in cancer immunotherapy has had limited success.
      In this study, IFN genes were delivered into B16 melanoma cells by lentiviral
      vectors, and their effects on B16 melanoma were comprehensively analyzed. Type II
      IFN significantly impaired the viability of B16 cells in vitro. Expression of
      IFNalpha and IFNbeta in B16 cells efficiently suppressed the establishment of
      inoculated melanoma. However, intratumoral delivery of IFNs alone with lentiviral
      vectors had no therapeutic effects on established melanoma. To address the lack
      of response, a lentivector was constructed to simultaneously transfer therapeutic
      genes and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). IFNs and siRNA targeting signal
      transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which is a major immune
      suppressive transcription factor in melanoma, were delivered simultaneously into 
      the tumor milieu. This treatment successfully rescued the response to IFNgamma
      and attenuated the growth of established tumors. This method has the potential to
      improve the therapeutic effects of IFNs in cancer immunotherapy.

PG  - 741-8
LID - 10.1038/cgt.2012.64 [doi]
AB  - The development of effective treatments that enable many patients suffering from 
      cancer to be successfully cured is highly demanded. Angiogenesis, which is a
      process for the formation of new capillary blood vessels, has a crucial role in
      solid tumor progression and the development of metastasis. Antiangiogenic therapy
      designed to prevent tumor angiogenesis, thereby arresting the growth or spread of
      tumors, has emerged as a non-invasive and safe option for cancer treatment. Due
      to the fact that integrin receptors are overexpressed on the surface of
      angiogenic endothelial cells, various strategies have been made to develop
      targeted delivery systems for cancer gene therapy utilizing integrin-targeting
      peptides with an exposed arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) sequence. The aim of
      this review is to summarize the progress and prospect of RGD-functionalized
      nonviral vectors toward targeted delivery of genetic materials in order to
      achieve an efficient therapeutic outcome for cancer gene therapy, including
      antiangiogenic therapy.

TI  - Neural stem cell-based dual suicide gene delivery for metastatic brain tumors.
PG  - 796-801
LID - 10.1038/cgt.2012.63 [doi]
AB  - In our previous works, we demonstrated that human neural stem cells (NSCs)
      transduced with the cytosine deaminase (CD) gene showed remarkable 'bystander
      killer effect' on glioma and medulloblastoma cells after administration of the
      prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC). In addition, herpes simplex virus thymidine
      kinase (TK) is a widely studied enzyme used for suicide gene strategies, for
      which the prodrug is ganciclovir (GCV). To apply this strategy to brain
      metastasis treatment, we established here a human NSC line (F3.CD-TK) expressing 
      the dual suicide genes CD and TK. We examined whether F3.CD-TK cells intensified 
      the antitumor effect on lung cancer brain metastases. In vitro studies showed
      that F3.CD-TK cells exerted a marked bystander effect on human lung cancer cells 
      after treatment with 5-FC and GCV. In a novel experimental brain metastases
      model, intravenously administered F3 cells migrated near lung cancer metastatic
      lesions, which were induced by the injection of lung cancer cells via the
      intracarotid artery. More importantly, F3.CD-TK cells in the presence of prodrugs
      5-FC and GCV decreased tumor size and considerably prolonged animal survival. The
      results of the present study indicate that the dual suicide gene-engineered,
      NSC-based treatment strategy might offer a new promising therapeutic modality for
      brain metastases.

PG  - 5153-62
LID - 10.1182/blood-2012-05-432427 [doi]
AB  - Immunotherapy with innate immune cells has recently evoked broad interest as a
      novel treatment option for cancer patients. gamma9delta2T cells in particular are
      emerging as an innate cell population with high frequency and strong antitumor
      reactivity, which makes them and their receptors promising candidates for immune 
      interventions. However, clinical trials have so far reported only limited tumor
      control by adoptively transferred gamma9delta2T cells. As a potential explanation
      for this lack of efficacy, we found unexpectedly high variability in tumor
      recognition within the physiologic human gamma9delta2T-cell repertoire, which is 
      substantially regulated by the CDR3 domains of individual gamma9delta2TCRs. In
      the present study, we demonstrate that the reported molecular requirements of
      CDR3 domains to interact with target cells shape the physiologic
      gamma9delta2T-cell repertoire and, most likely, limit the protective and
      therapeutic antitumor efficacy of gamma9delta2T cells. Based on these findings,
      we propose combinatorial-gammadeltaTCR-chain exchange as an efficient method for 
      designing high-affinity gamma9delta2TCRs that mediate improved antitumor
      responses when expressed in alphabetaT cells both in vitro and in vivo in a
      humanized mouse model.

TI  - Current status of implant-based breast reconstruction in patients receiving
      postmastectomy radiation therapy.
PG  - 513e-523e
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of patients with breast cancer are being treated
      with postmastectomy radiation therapy. The author reviewed the literature to
      determine the clinical impact of this increasing use of postmastectomy radiation 
      therapy in patients with breast cancer who desire implant-based breast
      reconstruction. METHODS: The author searched the MEDLINE database for articles on
      breast reconstruction and radiation therapy published between January of 2008 and
      June of 2011 and reviewed the abstracts of those articles to identify articles
      with information about the impact of irradiation on implant-based breast
      reconstruction. This subgroup of articles was reviewed in detail. RESULTS: Two
      hundred eighty-five articles were identified. Nineteen articles were reviewed in 
      detail. Eight articles provided level III evidence; one provided level I or II
      evidence from high-quality multicenter or single-center randomized controlled
      trials or prospective cohort studies. Two articles provided level IV evidence
      from case series and were included in the review because they offered a novel
      approach or perspective. The most recent studies find a significant need for
      unplanned or major corrective surgery in irradiated breasts reconstructed with
      implants. Although breast implant reconstruction in irradiated breasts is
      associated with high rates of complications, only a minority of patients require 
      conversion to an autologous tissue flap. CONCLUSION: Although the majority of
      patients who undergo implant-based reconstruction and irradiation ultimately keep
      the implant reconstruction, patient surveys show that irradiation has a
      significantly negative effect on patient satisfaction.

TI  - Why imatinib remains an exception of cancer research.
PG  - 665-70
LID - 10.1002/jcp.24233 [doi]
AB  - The archetype driving the drug targeting approach to cancer therapy is the
      success of imatinib against chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP).
      Molecular targeting success of this magnitude has yet to be repeated for most
      solid tumors. To answer why imatinib remains an exception of cancer research, we 
      summarize key features and patterns of evolution that contrast CML-CP from
      prostate cancer, an example of a solid tumor that also shares a signature fusion 
      gene. Distinctive properties of CML-CP include: a large cell population size that
      is not geographically constrained, a highly penetrant dominant oncogene that
      sweeps the entire cell population, subsequent progressive and ordered clonal
      genetic changes, and the effectiveness of molecular targeting within the chronic 
      phase, which is comparable to the benign phase of solid tumors. CML-CP
      progression resembles a clonal, stepwise model of evolution, whereas the pattern 
      of solid tumor evolution is highly dynamic and stochastic. The distinguishing
      features and evolutionary pattern of CML-CP support why the success of imatinib
      does not carry over to most solid tumors. Changing the focus of cancer research
      from a gene-based view to a genome-based theory will provide insight into solid
      tumor evolutionary dynamics.

TI  - Health behaviors and cancer screening among Californians with a family history of
      cancer.
PG  - 212-21
LID - 10.1038/gim.2012.118 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare health behaviors and cancer
      screening among Californians with and without a family history of cancer.
      METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2005 California Health Interview Survey to
      ascertain cancer screening test use and to estimate the prevalence of health
      behaviors that may reduce the risk of cancer. We used logistic regression to
      control for demographic factors and health-care access. RESULTS: Women with a
      family history of breast or ovarian cancer were more likely to be up to date with
      mammography as compared with women with no family history of cancer (odds ratio =
      1.69, 95% confidence interval (1.39, 2.04)); their health behaviors were similar 
      to other women. Men and women with a family history of colorectal cancer were
      more likely to be up to date with colorectal cancer screening as compared with
      individuals with no family history of cancer (odds ratio = 2.77, 95% confidence
      interval (2.20, 3.49)) but were less likely to have a body mass index <25 kg/m(2)
      (odds ratio = 0.80, 95% confidence interval (0.67, 0.94)). CONCLUSION: Innovative
      methods are needed to encourage those with a moderate-to-strong familial risk for
      breast cancer and colorectal cancer to increase their physical activity levels,
      strive to maintain a healthy weight, quit smoking, and reduce alcohol use.Genet

TI  - Genetic analysis of NR0B1 in congenital adrenal hypoplasia patients:
      identification of a rare regulatory variant resulting in congenital adrenal
      hypoplasia and hypogonadal hypogonadism without testicular carcinoma in situ.
PG  - 284-91
LID - 10.1159/000342295 [doi]
AB  - There have been few testicular histology reports of adult patients with
      congenital adrenal hypoplasia/hypogonadal hypogonadism (AHC/HH), but Leydig cell 
      hyperplasia has been observed, an indicator of the possibility of malignant
      transformation. We aimed to define the basis of AHC/HH in 4 pedigrees of
      different ethnic backgrounds. One patient was elected to have testicular biopsy
      which was examined for evidence of carcinoma in situ (CIS). NR0B1 mutation
      analysis was performed by sequence analysis. NR0B1 expression was investigated by
      RT-PCR. Testicular biopsy sections were stained with HE or immunostained for
      OCT3/4, an established marker of CIS. We identified NR0B1 variants in the 4 AHC
      pedigrees: pedigree 1 (United Arab Emirates), c.1130A>G predicting p.(Glu377Gly);
      pedigree 2 (English Caucasian), c.327C>A predicting p.(Cys109*); pedigree 3
      (Oman), a 6-bp deletion of a direct repeat, c.857_862delTGGTGC predicting
      p.(Leu286_Val287del); pedigree 4 (English Caucasian), c.1168+1G>A, a regulatory
      variant within the NR0B1 splice donor site. This last male patient, aged 30
      years, presented with evidence of HH but incomplete gonadotrophin deficiency,
      following an earlier diagnosis of Addison's disease at 3 years. Hormonal therapy 
      induced virilisation. Testicular biopsy was performed. The c.1168+1G>A variant
      abrogated normal splicing of testicular mRNA. Histological examination showed
      poorly organised testicular architecture and absence of spermatozoa.
      Morphological analyses and the absence of immunohistochemical staining for OCT3/4
      excluded the presence of malignant germ cell cancer and its precursor lesion,
      CIS. These studies add to the knowledge of the types and ethnic diversity of
      NR0B1 mutations and their associated phenotypes, and provide insight into the
      assessment and interpretation of testicular histology in AHC and HH.

TI  - Glioma cell growth inhibition following photochemical internalization enhanced
      non-viral PTEN gene transfection.
PG  - 746-54
LID - 10.1002/lsm.22082 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: One of many limitations for cancer gene therapy is the 
      inability of the therapeutic gene to transfect a sufficient number of tumor
      cells. Photochemical internalization (PCI) is a photodynamic therapy-based
      approach for improving the delivery of macromolecules and genes into the cell
      cytosol. The utility of PCI for the delivery of the GFP reporter gene on the same
      plasmid as a tumor suppressor gene (PTEN) was investigated in monolayers of U251 
      human glioma cells and muticell U87 glioma spheroids. MATERIALS AND METHODS: U251
      monolayers or U87 spheroids were incubated in AlPcS(2a) and non-viral vector
      polyplexes for 18 hours. In all cases, light treatment was performed with a diode
      laser at a wavelength of 670 nm. The non-viral transfection agents, branched
      polyethylenimine (bPEI), or protamine sulfate (PS), were used with the plasmid
      constructs GFP/PTEN or GFP. RESULTS: PS/GFP polyplexes were much less toxic to
      the glioma cells compared to bPEI/GFP polyplexes but were highly inefficient at
      gene transfection if used alone. PCI resulted in a 5- to 10-fold increase in GFP 
      protein expression compared to controls. PCI-bPEI/PTEN or PCI-PS/PTEN
      transfection of either U251 monolayers or U87 spheroids significantly inhibited
      their growth. but had no effect on MCF-7 cells containing a wild-type PTEN gene. 
      In addition PCI-GFP transfection of gliomas cells had no effect on their growth
      pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the results suggest that AlPcS(2a) -mediated 
      PCI can be used to enhance cell growth inhibition via transfection of tumor
      suppressor genes in glioma cells containing mutant PTEN genes.

TI  - Frequency and mechanism of ischemic stroke associated with malignancy: a
      retrospective series.
PG  - 209-13
LID - 10.1159/000341343 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular disease is the second most common non-metastatic
      neurological disorder in oncological patients. The aims of this study were to
      determine the prevalence of cancer in stroke patients and to compare mechanisms
      of stroke between patients with and without malignancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      This retrospective study involved patients with ischemic stroke admitted over 1
      year to a Neurology Department. Demographic and clinical data, cardiovascular
      risk factors, and laboratory findings were recorded. The etiology was classified 
      following the TOAST criteria. Participants were classified as stroke and cancer
      patients (diagnosis of malignancy before stroke or cancer diagnosed after
      admission) or as control stroke patients. RESULTS: Over 1 year, 291 stroke
      patients (268 ischemic) were admitted. Sixteen ischemic patients had a malignancy
      (5.9%), and in 12 patients, malignancy was the only cause found for the stroke;
      in 4 patients, malignancy was a coexisting condition. Coexistent stroke and
      cancer was significantly related to higher median levels of fibrinogen, D-dimers,
      and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Logistic regression analysis showed
      that D-dimer and ESR levels were independently related to cancer, with odds
      ratios of 1.004 (95% CI 1.001-1.007, p=0.02) and 1.075 (95% CI 1.031-1.121,
      p=0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Almost 6% of ischemic stroke patients had a 
      concomitant malignancy. In most of them, cancer was the only cause of stroke
      found. Patients with stroke and malignancy exhibited raised D-dimer, fibrinogen, 
      and ESR levels, suggesting the prothrombotic state was a principal mechanism
      underlying stroke. D-dimer and ESR assessments may be useful in identifying
      underlying disorders in ischemic stroke.

AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The early detection of persistent/recurrent disease of
      head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) after treatment can be challenging.
      The currently used radioisotope (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is a nonspecific
      tracer for cancer cells as it detects all metabolically active cells including
      inflammation. (18)F-fluorodeoxythymidine (FLT) is a radioactive tracer for
      rapidly proliferating cells, and therefore is more specific for detecting cancer.
      Our aim was to compare FLT and FDG microPET (positron-emission tomography) to the
      gold standard in vivo bioluminescence imaging for serial assessment of neoplastic
      growth in a minimal residual disease in vivo model. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective
      outcomes research. METHODS: In order to mimic the postsurgical environment of
      HNSCC patients FaDu cells transfected with a luciferase-expressing retrovirus
      were inoculated into the skin flap of Balb/c nu/nu mice. Three days later before 
      tumors formed, mice were randomized into (18)F-FLT or (18) F-FDG groups, and
      microPET imaging was performed on days 3, 6, 10, 18, and 24 after tumor cell
      inoculation. RESULTS: (18)F-FLT detected tumors as early as day 3 even before
      tumors were palpable, whereas (18)F-FDG only detected palpable tumors. The
      average overall normalized radioactivity in the FLT group was significantly
      higher than the FDG group (P = .025). CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-FLT identified tumor
      cells before tumors were palpable and can potentially be used for early detection
      of persistence/recurrence of HNSCC. In addition, this radioisotope can be used to
      monitor adjuvant therapy with novel targeted therapeutics in preclinical models
      of persistent disease.

AB  - Epigenetic modifications, such as aberrant DNA promoter methylation, are
      frequently observed in cervical cancer. Identification of hypermethylated regions
      allowing discrimination between normal cervical epithelium and high-grade
      cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2/3), or worse, may improve current
      cervical cancer population-based screening programs. In this study, the DNA
      methylome of high-grade CIN lesions was studied using genome-wide DNA methylation
      screening to identify potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of cervical
      neoplasia. Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) combined with DNA
      microarray was used to compare DNA methylation profiles of epithelial cells
      derived from high-grade CIN lesions with normal cervical epithelium.
      Hypermethylated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified.
      Validation of nine selected DMRs using BSP and MSP in cervical tissue revealed
      methylation in 63.2-94.7% high-grade CIN and in 59.3-100% cervical carcinomas.
      QMSP for the two most significant high-grade CIN-specific methylation markers was
      conducted exploring test performance in a large series of cervical scrapings.
      Frequency and relative level of methylation were significantly different between 
      normal and cancer samples. Clinical validation of both markers in cervical
      scrapings from patients with an abnormal cervical smear confirmed that frequency 
      and relative level of methylation were related with increasing severity of the
      underlying CIN lesion and that ROC analysis was discriminative. These markers
      represent the COL25A1 and KATNAL2 and their observed increased methylation upon
      progression could intimate the regulatory role in carcinogenesis. In conclusion, 
      our newly identified hypermethylated DMRs represent specific DNA methylation
      patterns in high-grade CIN lesions and are candidate biomarkers for early
      detection.

TI  - PTEN losses exhibit heterogeneity in multifocal prostatic adenocarcinoma and are 
      associated with higher Gleason grade.
PG  - 435-47
LID - 10.1038/modpathol.2012.162 [doi]
AB  - Prostatic adenocarcinoma is an epithelial malignancy characterized by marked
      histological heterogeneity. It most often has a multifocal distribution within
      the gland, and different Gleason grades may be present within different foci.
      Data from our group and others have shown that the genomic deletion of the
      phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) tumor suppressor
      gene and the disruption of the ETS gene family have a central role in prostate
      cancer and are likely to be associated with Gleason grade. In this study,
      prostate cancer samples were systematically analyzed to determine whether there
      was concordance between PTEN losses and TMPRSS2-ERG fusion rearrangements, within
      or between foci in multifocal disease, using well-annotated tissue microarrays
      (TMAs) consisting of 724 cores derived from 142 radical prostatectomy specimens. 
      Three-color fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of both the PTEN deletion
      and the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was used to precisely map genetic heterogeneity, both 
      within and between tumor foci represented on the TMA. PTEN deletion was observed 
      in 56 of 134 (42%) patients (hemizygous=42 and homozygous=14). TMPRSS2-ERG fusion
      was observed in 63 of 139 (45%) patients. When analyzed by Gleason pattern for a 
      given TMA core, PTEN deletions were significantly associated with Gleason grades 
      4 or 5 over grade 3 (P<0.001). Although TMPRSS2-ERG fusions showed a strong
      relationship with PTEN deletions (P=0.007), TMPRSS2-ERG fusions did not show
      correlation with Gleason grade. The pattern of genetic heterogeneity of PTEN
      deletion was more diverse than that observed for TMPRSS2-ERG fusions in
      multifocal disease. However, the marked interfocal discordance for both
      TMPRSS2-ERG fusions and PTEN deletions was consistent with the concept that
      multiple foci of prostate cancer arise independently within the same prostate,
      and that individual tumor foci can have distinct patterns of genetic
      rearrangements.

TI  - Involvement of Akt2/protein kinase B beta (PKBbeta) in the 8-Cl-cAMP-induced
      cancer cell growth inhibition.
PG  - 890-902
LID - 10.1002/jcp.24240 [doi]
AB  - 8-chloro-cyclic AMP (8-Cl-cAMP), which induces differentiation, growth
      inhibition, and apoptosis in various cancer cells, has been investigated as a
      putative anti-cancer drug. However, the exact mechanism of 8-Cl-cAMP functioning 
      in cancer cells is not fully understood. Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) genes (Akt1, 
      Akt2, and Akt3) encode enzymes belonging to the serine/threonine-specific protein
      kinase family. It has been suggested that Akt/PKB enhances cell survival by
      inhibiting apoptosis. Recently, we showed that 8-Cl-cAMP and
      5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) inhibited cancer cell
      growth through the activation of AMPK and p38 MAPK. Therefore, we anticipated
      that the phosphorylation of Akt/PKB would be decreased upon treatment with
      8-Cl-cAMP. However, treatment with 8-Cl-cAMP and AICAR induced the
      phosphorylation of Akt/PKB, which was inhibited by ABT702 (an adenosine kinase
      inhibitor) and NBTI (an adenosine transporter inhibitor). Furthermore, whereas
      Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor), AMPK-DN (AMPK-dominant negative) mutant, and
      SB203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor) did not block the 8-Cl-cAMP-induced
      phosphorylation of Akt/PKB, TCN (an Akt1/2/3 specific inhibitor) and an
      Akt2/PKBbeta-targeted siRNA inhibited the 8-Cl-cAMP- and AICAR-mediated
      phosphorylation of AMPK and p38 MAPK. TCN also reversed the growth inhibition
      mediated by 8-Cl-cAMP and AICAR. Moreover, an Akt1/PKBalpha-targeted siRNA did
      not reduce the phosphorylation of AMPK and p38 MAPK after treatment with
      8-Cl-cAMP. These results suggest that Akt2/PKBbeta activation promotes the
      phosphorylation of AMPK and p38 MAPK during the 8-Cl-cAMP- and AICAR-induced
      growth inhibition.

AB  - Di(3-thienyl)methanol (2) and di(3-thienyl)methane (3) have been synthesized and 
      screened against the T98G (brain cancer) cell line. Treatment induced cell death 
      (MTT and macro-colony assay), growth inhibition, cytogenetic damage (micronuclei 
      formation), were studied as cellular response parameters. Treatment with the
      compounds enhanced growth inhibition and cell death in a concentration dependent 
      manner in both T98G and HEK (normal) cell lines. At higher concentrations (>20
      microg/mL) the cytotoxic effects of the compounds were highly significant. The
      effect on clonogenic capacity and micronuclei formation observed after treatment 
      of cells. Amongst the compounds, compound 2 exhibited potent activity against
      T98G brain cancer cells. Despite potent in vitro activity, both compounds
      exhibited less cytotoxicity against normal human HEK cells at all effective
      concentrations.

TI  - Evaluation of therapeutic response to concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients
      with cervical cancer using diffusion-weighted MR imaging.
PG  - 187-93
LID - 10.1002/jmri.23804 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the changes in apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) in 
      cervical cancer patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), and to
      assess the relationship between tumor ADCs or changes in tumor ADCs and final
      tumor responses to therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with
      cervical cancer who received CCRT were examined with 3 Tesla (T) MRI including
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). All patients had three serial MR examinations: 
      before therapy (pre-Tx); at 4 weeks of therapy (mid-Tx); and 1 month after
      completion of therapy (post-Tx). At each examination, ADC was measured in tumors 
      and normal gluteus muscles. Final tumor response as determined by change in tumor
      size or volume using MRI was correlated with tumor ADCs at each therapeutic time 
      or changes in tumor ADCs at mid-Tx. RESULTS: From pre-Tx to post-Tx, mean tumor
      ADCs were 0.88, 1.30, and 1.47 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s in sequence (P < 0.001), while
      those of normal gluteus muscles were 1.24, 1.29, and 1.21 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s in
      sequence (P > 0.05). At mid-Tx, tumor ADCs and changes in tumor ADCs had a
      significant correlation with final tumor size responses (P = 0.029 and 0.025,
      respectively). However, the tumor ADC values at pre-Tx were not associated with
      the final tumor size response (P = 0.47). The final tumor volume response was not
      associated with tumor ADC at pre-Tx or mid-Tx (P > 0.05) or changes in tumor ADCs
      at mid-Tx (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: DWI may have potentials in evaluating the
      therapeutic response to CCRT in patients with cervical cancer.

TI  - G31P, an antagonist against CXC chemokine receptors 1 and 2, inhibits growth of
      human prostate cancer cells in nude mice.
PG  - 147-56
AB  - Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in Western countries. Chemokine
      C-X-C motif receptor 1 (CXCR1) and CXCR2 play a key role in generation and
      regulation of CXC chemokine signaling. CXCR1 is a receptor for interleukin 8
      (IL8), a pro-inflammatory chemokine, and CXCR1/2 are crucially involved in the
      prostate cancer development and progression. Thus, we generated a high-affinity
      human CXCR1/CXCR2 inhibitor, CXCL8 (3-72) K11R/G31P, named G31P, which is a
      synthetic derivative of the human cytokine, IL-8. In this study, we investigated 
      the effects of G31P on regulation of prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in 
      nude mouse xenografts. Cell viability, adhesion, and wound healing assays were
      used to assess the effects of G31P on growth, adhesion, and migration of PC-3
      human prostate cancer cells in vitro, respectively. Nude mouse xenografts and
      xenograft implantation assays were performed to determine the effect of G31P on
      PC-3 cells in vivo. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect gene expression, and 
      fluorescence imaging was used to detect tumor volume and microvessel density in
      tumor xenografts. The data showed that G31P treatment significantly reduced PC-3 
      cell viability, adhesion and migration capacity in a dose-dependent manner (up to
      100 ng/ml). Additionally, G31P treatment of nude mice suppressed the growth of
      orthotopically transplanted tumor xenografts. G31P also inhibited tumor tissue
      vascularization, which was associated with the decreased expression of vascular
      endothelial growth factor and nuclear transcription factor (NF)-kappaB in
      orthotopic xenograft tissues. This study provides evidence that G31P, a CXCR1/2
      inhibitor, may effectively control prostate cancer.

TI  - [Characterization of the structure, function and regulation of the chicken
      mir-17-92 cluster].
PG  - 455-62
AB  - The miRNA cluster mir-17-92 is conserved in vertebrates and plays crucial roles
      in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and animal development. The
      mir-17-92 cluster also acts as an oncogene that is expressed in variety of
      cancers. Despite extensive study, the molecular mechanism underlying its
      functions is not fully understood. The fact that miRNAs in the same cluster are
      functionally related was used in the present study to investigate the function,
      and regulation of the chicken mir-17-92 cluster with GO analysis, pathway
      analysis, and binding site distribution analysis. The investigation found that
      the chicken mir-17-92 cluster regulated several vital cellular signaling
      pathways, including the MAPK, Wnt and TGF-beta signaling pathway. A miRNA binding
      site distribution analysis found that multiple miRNAs within the mir-17-92
      cluster targeted the same genes, suggesting that the miRNA members of the
      mir-17-92 cluster act synergetically to regulate target genes. This study paves
      the way for future investigation into how the mir-17-92 cluster may regulate key 
      cellular processes involved in cancer and development.

      colorectal cancer.
PG  - 1433-57
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djs369 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is a major global public health problem, with
      approximately 950,000 patients newly diagnosed each year. We report the first
      comprehensive field synopsis and creation of a parallel publicly available and
      regularly updated database (CRCgene) that catalogs all genetic association
      studies on colorectal cancer (http://www.chs.med.ed.ac.uk/CRCgene/). METHODS: We 
      performed two independent systematic reviews, reviewing 10&emsp14;145 titles,
      then collated and extracted data from 635 publications reporting on 445
      polymorphisms in 110 different genes. We carried out meta-analyses to derive
      summary effect estimates for 92 polymorphisms in 64 different genes. For
      assessing the credibility of associations, we applied the Venice criteria and the
      Bayesian False Discovery Probability (BFDP) test. RESULTS: We consider 16
      independent variants at 13 loci (MUTYH, MTHFR, SMAD7, and common variants tagging
      the loci 8q24, 8q23.3, 11q23.1, 14q22.2, 1q41, 20p12.3, 20q13.33, 3q26.2,
      16q22.1, and 19q13.1) to have the most highly credible associations with
      colorectal cancer, with all variants except those in MUTYH and 19q13.1 reaching
      genome-wide statistical significance in at least one meta-analysis model. We
      identified less-credible (higher heterogeneity, lower statistical power, BFDP
      >0.2) associations with 23 more variants at 22 loci. The meta-analyses of a
      further 20 variants for which associations have previously been reported found no
      evidence to support these as true associations. CONCLUSION: The CRCgene database 
      provides the context for genetic association data to be interpreted appropriately
      and helps inform future research direction.

PG  - 91-6
LID - 10.4261/1305-3825.DIR.5838-12.2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that may have an
      impact on upgrading atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) lesions to malignancy.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between February 1999 and December 2010, the records of
      150 ADH lesions that had been biopsied were retrospectively reviewed. The biopsy 
      types included 11-gauge stereotactic vacuum-assisted biopsy (SVAB) (n=102) and
      ultrasonography (US)-guided 14-gauge automated biopsy (n=48). The patients were
      divided into two groups: those who had cancer in the final pathology and those
      who did not. Variables associated with underestimation of ADH lesions were
      compared between the groups. RESULTS: The underestimation rates according to the 
      biopsy types were 41.7% (20/48) for the US-guided 14-gauge automated biopsy and
      20.6% (21/102) for the 11-gauge SVAB (P = 0.007). The rate of underestimation was
      significantly higher in lesions greater than 7 mm than it was in smaller lesions,
      with both US-guided 14-gauge automated biopsy and 11-gauge SVAB (P = 0.024 and P 
      = 0.042, respectively). The rate of underestimation was significantly higher with
      the 11-gauge SVAB (P = 0.025) in lesions that were suspicious (R4) and highly
      suggestive of malignancy (R5) than in those that were probably benign (R3).
      CONCLUSION: The underestimation rate in ADH lesions was significantly higher with
      US-guided 14-gauge automated biopsy compared to the 11-gauge SVAB. The
      underestimation rate was also significantly higher in lesions greater than 7 mm
      regardless of the biopsy type, and in lesions biopsied using SVAB that were
      regarded as suspicious (R4) or highly suggestive of malignancy (R5) on imaging.

TI  - Do prostate cancer patients suffer more from depressed mood or anhedonia?
PG  - 1718-23
LID - 10.1002/pon.3203 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the prevalence of depressed mood and
      anhedonia in a sample of men with prostate cancer (PCa) and to determine which of
      these key symptoms contributed most to the overall depressive status of that
      sample. METHOD: From Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) responses collected 
      on 526 PCa patients, direct comparisons were made between the prevalence of the
      first two DSM-IV-TR symptoms of Major Depressive Episode. These symptoms were
      then tested for their predictive power on depression total score and Zung's
      criteria for 'clinically significant' depression. RESULTS: Mean scores for
      anhedonia were significantly higher than for depressed mood, and nearly 25 times 
      as many patients had a high score for anhedonia as for depressed mood. The same
      pattern of results was apparent for those patients who had clinically significant
      levels of depression. Anhedonia was a more powerful predictor of total SDS
      depression score for the entire sample as well as for those patients with more
      severe depression. CONCLUSION: Because the biological basis for anhedonia is
      different to that for depressed mood, treatment options also differ for patients 
      who show a preponderance of anhedonia in their depressive symptomatology.
      Suggestions are made for treatment choices for these PCa patients.

TI  - Long-term mortality risks associated with mild anaemia in older persons: the
      Busselton Health Study.
PG  - 759-64
LID - 10.1093/ageing/afs150 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: up to 25% of older people in the USA and other Western countries are 
      anaemic by World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. The objective of this study 
      was to examine the long-term relationships of haemoglobin concentration with
      all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a community-based sample of Australian 
      adults surveyed in 1978. METHODS: a community survey of 2,194 adults aged 40+
      years in Busselton, Western Australia in 1978 with mortality follow-up to 2001.
      Cox regression models were used to investigate the relationships of haemoglobin
      as a continuous measure and anaemia by WHO criteria (women <12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l);
      men <13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l)) with all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality.
      RESULTS: anaemia was predominantly mild (>10 g/dl) and normocytic. There was an
      increased risk of death from all causes and from cancer for men with low
      haemoglobin. Cancers were predominantly of the prostate and genito-urinary
      organs, and to a lesser extent the gastrointestinal tract. There was no increased
      risk of all cause or cancer death in women. CONCLUSION: mild, normocytic anaemia 
      is associated with survival reductions in middle-aged and older men, where it
      often occurs with prostate, gastrointestinal and other cancers, and should be
      investigated to exclude treatable causes.

TI  - Factors predisposing to chyle leakage following thyroid cancer surgery without
      lateral neck dissection.
PG  - 1149-52
LID - 10.1002/hed.23104 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to assess the clinicopathologic features 
      of patients with chyle leakage following thyroid cancer surgery without lateral
      neck dissection and to evaluate the factors associated with chyle leakage.
      METHODS: Of 3137 patients who underwent thyroid surgery between January 2006 and 
      December 2007, 2314 patients (73.8%) satisfied our inclusion criteria. Patients
      were divided into those with (group I, n = 14) and without (group II, n = 2300)
      chyle leakage. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the 2
      groups in clinicopathologic features including age, body mass index, extent of
      thyroidectomy, pathologic type, tumor size, multiplicity, capsular invasion, and 
      coexisting thyroiditis. In univariate and multivariate analyses, male sex, age
      >45 years, and number of harvested central nodes were significantly associated
      with chyle leakage. CONCLUSIONS: If extensive central compartment node dissection
      is needed, meticulous dissection is required, especially in male patients, and
      aged >45 years, even without lateral neck dissection.

TI  - Translating genomic information into clinical medicine: lung cancer as a
      paradigm.
PG  - 2101-8

AB  - We are currently in an era of rapidly expanding knowledge about the genetic
      landscape and architectural blueprints of various cancers. These discoveries have
      led to a new taxonomy of malignant diseases based upon clinically relevant
      molecular alterations in addition to histology or tissue of origin. The new
      molecularly based classification holds the promise of rational rather than
      empiric approaches for the treatment of cancer patients. However, the accelerated
      pace of discovery and the expanding number of targeted anti-cancer therapies
      present a significant challenge for healthcare practitioners to remain informed
      and up-to-date on how to apply cutting-edge discoveries into daily clinical
      practice. In this Perspective, we use lung cancer as a paradigm to discuss
      challenges related to translating genomic information into the clinic, and we
      present one approach we took at Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center to address these 
      challenges.

TI  - Genistein and bisphenol A exposure cause estrogen receptor 1 to bind thousands of
      sites in a cell type-specific manner.
PG  - 2153-62
LID - 10.1101/gr.135681.111 [doi]
AB  - Endogenous estrogens that are synthesized in the body impact gene regulation by
      activating estrogen receptors in diverse cell types. Exogenous compounds that
      have estrogenic properties can also be found circulating in the blood in both
      children and adults. The genome-wide impact of these environmental estrogens on
      gene regulation is unclear. To obtain an integrated view of gene regulation in
      response to environmental and endogenous estrogens on a genome-wide scale, we
      performed ChIP-seq to identify estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1; previously estrogen
      receptor alpha) binding sites, and RNA-seq in endometrial cancer cells exposed to
      bisphenol A (BPA; found in plastics), genistein (GEN; found in soybean), or
      17beta-estradiol (E2; an endogenous estrogen). GEN and BPA treatment induces
      thousands of ESR1 binding sites and >50 gene expression changes, representing a
      subset of E2-induced gene regulation changes. Genes affected by E2 were highly
      enriched for ribosome-associated proteins; however, GEN and BPA failed to
      regulate most ribosome-associated proteins and instead enriched for transporters 
      of carboxylic acids. Treatment-dependent changes in gene expression were
      associated with treatment-dependent ESR1 binding sites, with the exception that
      many genes up-regulated by E2 harbored a BPA-induced ESR1 binding site but failed
      to show any expression change after BPA treatment. GEN and BPA exhibited a
      similar relationship to E2 in the breast cancer line T-47D, where cell type
      specificity played a much larger role than treatment specificity. Overall, both
      environmental estrogens clearly regulate gene expression through ESR1 on a
      genome-wide scale, although with lower potency resulting in less ESR1 binding
      sites and less gene expression changes compared to the endogenous estrogen, E2.

TI  - The role of elective neck dissection in patients undergoing salvage laryngectomy.
PG  - 1392-6
LID - 10.1002/hed.23145 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the risk of neck metastases in patients undergoing
      salvage total laryngectomy in association with previous radiotherapy. METHODS:
      The medical records of 42 patients (51 neck specimens) with clinical N0
      classification who underwent salvage total laryngectomy in 2 cancer centers were 
      reviewed. Fourteen patients had previous radiotherapy to the central neck and 28 
      to the central and lateral neck. RESULTS: Staging before salvage total
      laryngectomy was similar in both groups. The risk of neck metastases in the
      central and central/lateral radiation groups was 12% and 18%, respectively (p =
      .69). Subgroup analysis revealed that 4 of 8 patients initially presenting with
      clinically N+ had neck metastases before surgery, versus 2 of 26 for those with
      clinically N0 (p = .015; relative risk [RR] = 4.67). The risk or metastases in
      the contralateral neck was 0 of 9. CONCLUSION: The risk of neck metastases in
      patients who undergo either central or central/lateral neck radiotherapy is
      similar. Elective neck dissection seems appropriate in patients undergoing SLR.

TI  - Radiation therapy following surgery for localized breast cancer: outcome
      prediction by classical prognostic factors and approximated genetic subtypes.
PG  - 292-8
LID - 10.1093/jrr/rrs087 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome prediction power of
      classical prognostic factors along with surrogate approximation of genetic
      signatures (AGS) subtypes in patients affected by localized breast cancer (BC)
      and treated with postoperative radiotherapy. We retrospectively analyzed 468
      consecutive female patients affected by localized BC with complete
      immunohistochemical and pathological information available. All patients
      underwent surgery plus radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 59 months (range,
      6-132) from the diagnosis. Disease recurrences (DR), local and/or distant, and
      contralateral breast cancer (CBC) were registered and analyzed in relation to
      subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER-2, and basal), and classical prognostic
      factors (PFs), namely age, nodal status (N), tumor classification (T), grading
      (G), estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors and erb-B2 status. Bootstrap
      technique for variable selection and bootstrap resampling to test selection
      stability were used. Regarding AGS subtypes, HER-2 and basal were more likely to 
      recur than luminal A and B subtypes, while patients in the basal group were more 
      likely to have CBC. However, considering PFs along with AGS subtypes, the optimal
      multivariable predictive model for DR consisted of age, T, N, G and ER. A
      single-variable model including basal subtype resulted again as the optimal
      predictive model for CBC. In patients bearing localized BC the combination of
      classical clinical variables age, T, N, G and ER was still confirmed to be the
      best predictor of DR, while the basal subtype was demonstrated to be
      significantly and exclusively correlated with CBC.

AB  - A high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q-time of flight mass
      spectrometry (HPLC/Q-TOF MS) method was developed and validated for the
      determination of 1, 3-diaminopropane, putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine and
      spermine in human plasma. The plasma samples were first pretreated by 10% HClO(4)
      and then derived by benzoyl chloride with 1, 6-diaminohexane as internal
      standard. The derived polyamines were separated on a C(18) column using a
      gradient program. The detection was performed on a Q-TOF MS by positive
      ionization mode. Calibration curve for each polyamine was obtained in the
      concentration range of 0.4 ~ 200.0 ng * ml(-1), with limit of detection of 0.02 ~
      0.1 ng * ml(-1). The intra- and inter-day RSD for all polyamines were 2.5-14.0%
      and 2.9 ~ 13.4%, respectively. The method was applied to determine the polyamines
      in human plasma from cancer patients and healthy volunteers. Results showed that 
      the mean levels of polyamines in the plasma of cancer patients were higher than
      that of healthy volunteers, which suggested that the plasma polyamines could be
      employed as cancer diagnostic indicators in clinical testing.

      role of MCP-1.
PG  - G1087-95
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00252.2012 [doi]
AB  - Tumor-associated macrophages are associated with poor prognosis in certain
      cancers. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) is thought to be the most
      important chemokine for recruitment of macrophages to the tumor microenvironment.
      However, its role on tumorigenesis in a genetic mouse model of colon cancer has
      not been explored. We examined the role of MCP-1 on tumor-associated macrophages,
      inflammation, and intestinal tumorigenesis. Male Apc(Min/+),
      Apc(Min/+)/MCP-1(-/-) or wild-type mice were euthanized at 18 wk of age and
      intestines were analyzed for polyp burden, apoptosis, proliferation,
      beta-catenin, macrophage number and phenotype, markers for cytotoxic T
      lymphocytes and regulatory T cells, and inflammatory mediators. MCP-1 deficiency 
      decreased overall polyp number by 20% and specifically large polyp number by 45% 
      (P < 0.05). This was consistent with an increase in apoptotic cells (P < 0.05),
      but there was no change detected in proliferation or beta-catenin. MCP-1
      deficiency decreased F4/80-positive cells in both the polyp tissue and
      surrounding intestinal tissue (P < 0.05) as well as expression of markers
      associated with M1 (IL-12 and IL-23) and M2 macrophages (IL-13, CD206, TGF-beta, 
      and CCL17) (P < 0.05). MCP-1 knockout was also associated with increased
      cytotoxic T lymphocytes and decreased regulatory T cells (P < 0.05). In addition,
      MCP-1(-/-) offset the increased mRNA expression of IL-1beta and IL-6 in
      intestinal tissue and IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in polyp tissue (P < 0.05), and
      prevented the decrease in SOCS1 expression (P < 0.05). We demonstrate that MCP-1 
      is an important mediator of tumor growth and immune regulation that may serve as 
      an important biomarker and/or therapeutic target in colon cancer.

TI  - Persistent androgen receptor-mediated transcription in castration-resistant
      prostate cancer under androgen-deprived conditions.
PG  - 10765-79
LID - 10.1093/nar/gks888 [doi]
AB  - The androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-inducible transcription factor that
      mediates androgen action in target tissues. Upon ligand binding, the AR binds to 
      thousands of genomic loci and activates a cell-type specific gene program.
      Prostate cancer growth and progression depend on androgen-induced AR signaling.
      Treatment of advanced prostate cancer through medical or surgical castration
      leads to initial response and durable remission, but resistance inevitably
      develops. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), AR activity remains
      critical for tumor growth despite androgen deprivation. Although previous studies
      have focused on ligand-dependent AR signaling, in this study we explore AR
      function under the androgen-deprived conditions characteristic of CRPC. Our data 
      demonstrate that AR persistently occupies a distinct set of genomic loci after
      androgen deprivation in CRPC. These androgen-independent AR occupied regions have
      constitutively open chromatin structures that lack the canonical androgen
      response element and are independent of FoxA1, a transcription factor involved in
      ligand-dependent AR targeting. Many AR binding events occur at proximal
      promoters, which can act as enhancers to augment transcriptional activities of
      other promoters through DNA looping. We further show that androgen-independent AR
      binding directs a gene expression program in CRPC, which is necessary for the
      growth of CRPC after androgen withdrawal.

PG  - 6183-90
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-2635 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the fraction of newly detected human papillomavirus (HPV)
      infections due to acquisition and reactivation has important implications on
      screening strategies and prevention of HPV-associated neoplasia. Information on
      sexual activity and cervical samples for HPV DNA detection using Roche Linear
      Array were collected semiannually for two years from 700 women ages 35 to 60
      years. Incidence and potential fraction of HPV associated with new and lifetime
      sexual partnerships were estimated using Poisson regression. Cox frailty models
      were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for potential risk factors of incident
      HPV detection. Recent and lifetime numbers of sexual partners were both strongly 
      associated with incident HPV detection. However, only 13% of incident detections 
      were attributed to new sexual partners, whereas 72% were attributed to 5 or more 
      lifetime sexual partners. Furthermore, 155 of 183 (85%) incident HPV detections
      occurred during periods of sexual abstinence or monogamy, and were strongly
      associated with cumulative lifetime sexual exposure [HR: 4.1, 95% confidence
      interval (CI): 2.0-8.4). This association increased with increasing age. These
      data challenge the paradigm that incident HPV detection is driven by current
      sexual behavior and new viral acquisition in older women. Our observation that
      most incident HPV infection was attributable to past, not current, sexual
      behavior at older ages supports a natural history model of viral latency and
      reactivation. As the more highly exposed baby-boomer generation of women with
      sexual debut after the sexual revolution transition to menopause, the
      implications of HPV reactivation at older ages on cervical cancer risk and
      screening recommendations should be carefully evaluated.

TI  - FGFR3 stimulates stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 activity to promote bladder tumor
      growth.
PG  - 5843-55
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1329 [doi]
AB  - Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) belongs to a family of receptor
      tyrosine kinases that control cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. 
      Aberrant activation of FGFR3 via overexpression or mutation is a frequent feature
      of bladder cancer; however, its molecular and cellular consequences and
      functional relevance to carcinogenesis are not well understood. Through
      transcriptional profiling of bladder carcinoma cells subjected to short hairpin
      RNA knockdown of FGFR3, we identified a gene-signature linking FGFR3 signaling
      with de novo sterol and lipid biosynthesis and metabolism. We found that FGFR3
      signaling promotes the cleavage and activation of the master transcriptional
      regulator of lipogenesis, sterol regulatory element-binding protein
      1(SREBP1/SREBF1), in a PI3K-mTORC1-dependent fashion. In turn, SREBP1 regulates
      the expression of key lipogenic enzymes, including stearoyl CoA desaturase 1
      (SCD1/SCD). SCD1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of
      monounsaturated fatty acids and is crucial for lipid homeostasis. In human
      bladder cancer cell lines expressing constitutively active FGFR3, knockdown of
      SCD1 by siRNA markedly attenuated cell-cycle progression, reduced proliferation, 
      and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, inducible knockdown of SCD1 in a bladder
      cancer xenograft model substantially inhibited tumor progression. Pharmacologic
      inhibition of SCD1 blocked fatty acid desaturation and also exerted antitumor
      activity in vitro and in vivo. Together, these findings reveal a previously
      unrecognized role of FGFR3 in regulating lipid metabolism to maintain tumor
      growth and survival, and also identify SCD1 as a potential therapeutic target for
      FGFR3-driven bladder cancer.

TI  - Goserelin with chemotherapy to preserve ovarian function in pre-menopausal women 
      with early breast cancer: menstruation and pregnancy outcomes.
PG  - 133-8
LID - 10.1093/annonc/mds250 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Premature ovarian failure and infertility following chemotherapy in
      early breast cancer (EBC) are major concerns for young women. The role of
      gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists with chemotherapy in EBC in
      reducing the incidence of chemotherapy-induced early menopause remains uncertain,
      and long-term data on the recovery of fertility are sparse. We report an audit of
      our experience with the GnRH agonist, goserelin (Zoladex(R)), used with
      chemotherapy to preserve ovarian function and maintain fertility. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: Pre-menopausal women were given goserelin subcutaneously every 28 days
      during chemotherapy, starting 0-14 days before treatment. The main clinical end
      point was recovery of menstruation after chemotherapy. The other end points were 
      rate of successful conception and median time to recovery of menses. RESULTS:
      About 84% of 125 women recovered menstruation with the median time to recovery of
      6 months (1-43 months), including 76% of 71 patients aged over 35. Of the 42
      patients who attempted pregnancy, 71% (n=30) managed to achieve pregnancies. At
      the time of analysis, there were 42 pregnancies and 30 healthy deliveries.
      CONCLUSIONS: The GnRH agonist, goserelin, given with chemotherapy for EBC is
      associated with a low risk of long-term chemotherapy-induced amenorrhoea and a
      high chance of pregnancy. Further randomised trials are needed.

TI  - Patient-doctor agreement on recall of clinical trial discussion across cultures.
PG  - 391-7
LID - 10.1093/annonc/mds288 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose was to investigate patient-doctor agreement on clinical
      trial discussion cross-culturally. METHODS: In the International Breast Cancer
      Study Group Trial 33-03 on shared decision-making for early breast cancer in
      Australian/New Zealand (ANZ) and Swiss/German/Austrian (SGA) centers, doctor and 
      patient characteristics plus doctor stress and burnout were assessed. Within 2
      weeks post-consultation about treatment options, the doctor and patient reported 
      independently, whether a trial was discussed. Odds ratios of agreement for
      covariables were estimated by generalized estimating equations for each language 
      cohort, with doctor as a random effect. RESULTS: In ANZ, 21 doctors and 339
      patients were eligible; in SGA, 41 doctors and 427 patients. In cases where the
      doctor indicated 'no trial discussed', 82% of both ANZ and SGA patients agreed;
      if the doctor indicated 'trial discussed', 50% of ANZ and 38% of SGA patients
      agreed, respectively. Factors associated with higher agreement were: low tumor
      grade and fewer patients recruited into clinical trials in SGA; public
      institution, patient born in ANZ (versus other), higher doctor depersonalization 
      and personal accomplishment in ANZ. CONCLUSION: There is discordance between
      oncologists and their patients regarding clinical trial discussion, particularly 
      when the doctor indicates that a trial was discussed. Factors contributing to
      this agreement vary by culture.

TI  - Molecular pathways: the metabolic regulator estrogen-related receptor alpha as a 
      therapeutic target in cancer.
PG  - 6089-95
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-3221 [doi]
AB  - The estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) is an orphan member of the nuclear
      receptor superfamily of transcription factors whose activity is regulated by the 
      expression level and/or activity of its obligate coregulators, peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha and beta (PGC-1alpha or
      PGC-1beta). Under normal physiologic conditions, and in responding to different
      environmental stimuli, the ERRalpha/PGC-1 complex is involved in regulating
      metabolic homeostasis under conditions of high energy demand in brown adipocytes,
      proliferating T cells, and muscle. Interestingly, increased expression and
      activity of the ERRalpha/PGC-1 axis has also been shown to correlate with
      unfavorable clinical outcomes in both breast and ovarian tumors. The observation 
      that ERRalpha activity is manifest in all breast tumor subtypes with particularly
      high activity being evident in ERalpha-negative, HER2-positive, and
      triple-negative breast cancers has raised significant interest in targeting this 
      receptor for the treatment of those breast cancers for which therapeutic options 
      are limited.

PG  - 147-57
LID - 10.1373/clinchem.2012.184614 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Protein cancer biomarkers serve multiple clinical purposes, both
      early and late, during disease progression. The search for new and better
      biomarkers has become an integral component of contemporary cancer research.
      However, the number of new biomarkers cleared by the US Food and Drug
      Administration has declined substantially over the last 10 years, raising
      concerns regarding the efficiency of the biomarker-development pipeline. CONTENT:
      We describe different clinical uses of cancer biomarkers and their performance
      requirements. We also present examples of protein cancer biomarkers currently in 
      clinical use and their limitations. The major barriers that candidate biomarkers 
      need to overcome to reach the clinic are addressed. Finally, the long and arduous
      journey of a protein cancer biomarker from the bench to the clinic is outlined
      with an example. SUMMARY: The journey of a protein biomarker from the bench to
      the clinic is long and challenging. Every step needs to be meticulously planned
      and executed to succeed. The history of clinically useful biomarkers suggests
      that at least a decade is required for the transition of a marker from the bench 
      to the bedside. Therefore, it may be too early to expect that the new
      technological advances will catalyze the anticipated biomarker revolution any
      time soon.

TI  - Metabolic inhibition of sialyl-Lewis X biosynthesis by 5-thiofucose remodels the 
      cell surface and impairs selectin-mediated cell adhesion.
PG  - 40021-30
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M112.403568 [doi]
AB  - Sialyl-Lewis X (sLe(X)) is a tetrasaccharide that serves as a ligand for the set 
      of cell adhesion proteins known as selectins. This interaction enables adhesion
      of leukocytes and cancer cells to endothelial cells within capillaries, resulting
      in their extravasation into tissues. The last step in sLe(X) biosynthesis is the 
      alpha1,3-fucosyltrasferase (FUT)-catalyzed transfer of an L-fucose residue to
      carbohydrate acceptors. Impairing FUT activity compromises leukocyte homing to
      sites of inflammation and renders cancer cells less malignant. Inhibition of FUTs
      is, consequently, of great interest, but efforts to generate glycosyltransferase 
      inhibitors, including FUT inhibitors, has proven challenging. Here we describe a 
      metabolic engineering strategy to inhibit the biosynthesis of sLe(X) in cancer
      cells using peracetylated 5-thio-L-fucose (5T-Fuc). We show that 5T-Fuc is taken 
      up by cancer cells and then converted into a sugar nucleotide analog, GDP-5T-Fuc,
      that blocks FUT activity and limits sLe(X) presentation on HepG2 cells with an
      EC(50) in the low micromolar range. GDP-5T-Fuc itself does not get transferred by
      either FUT3 or FUT7 at a measurable rate. We further demonstrate that treatment
      of cells with 5T-Fuc impaired their adhesive properties to immobilized adhesion
      molecules and human endothelial cells. 5T-Fuc, therefore, is a useful probe that 
      can be used to modulate sLe(X) levels in cells to evaluate the consequences of
      inhibiting FUT-mediated sLe(X) formation. These data also reveal the utility of
      using sugar analogues that lead to formation of donor substrate analogues within 
      cells as a general approach to blocking glycosyltransferases in cells.

TI  - Correlation between the number of lymph node metastases and lung metastasis in
      papillary thyroid cancer.
PG  - 4375-82
LID - 10.1210/jc.2012-1257 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: A prognostic classification system based on aggregate numbers of lymph
      node metastases may better estimate the risk of distant metastasis. OBJECTIVE:
      This investigation sought to evaluate a papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) patient's 
      risk of distant metastasis. DESIGN: This was a retrospective analysis. SETTING:
      The setting was a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Included were 972 PTC
      patients. INTERVENTION: The intervention was compartment-oriented surgery. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measure was lung, bone, and liver metastasis.
      RESULTS: Eighty-seven (9.0%) of the 972 PTC patients had distant metastases to
      lung (79 patients), bone (16 patients), liver (two patients), brain and skin (one
      patient each). For distant metastasis, more than 20 lymph node metastases had a
      specificity of 90.8% and a negative predictive value of 92.7%, whereas
      sensitivity and positive predictive value were low (27.6 and 22.9%). On
      multivariate logistic regression, 1-5, 6-10, and 11-20 involved nodes denoted a
      moderate risk of lung metastasis [odds ratio (OR), 9.9, 10.6, and 13.8; P </=
      0.004], whereas more than 20 involved nodes indicated a high risk of lung
      metastasis (OR, 25.0; P < 0.001). Mediastinal lymph node metastasis carried a
      moderate risk of lung metastasis (OR, 7.5; P = 0.001). When these numeric
      categories of lymph node metastases were exchanged for current tumor node
      metastasis (TNM) N categories, the OR decreased from 25.0 (for > 20 lymph node
      metastases) to 16.4 (N1b), and from 9.9-13.8 (for 1-20 lymph node metastases) to 
      4.7 (N1a). CONCLUSION: In PTC, categories of 0, 1-20, and more than 20 lymph node
      metastases correlate better with lung metastasis than current TNM N categories
      N0, N1a, and N1b.

TI  - T cells engineered with a T cell receptor against the prostate antigen TARP
      specifically kill HLA-A2+ prostate and breast cancer cells.
PG  - 15877-81
AB  - To produce genetically engineered T cells directed against prostate and breast
      cancer cells, we have cloned the T-cell receptor recognizing the
      HLA-A2-restricted T-cell receptor gamma-chain alternate reading-frame protein
      (TARP)(4-13) epitope. TARP is a protein exclusively expressed in normal prostate 
      epithelium and in adenocarcinomas of the prostate and breast. Peripheral blood T 
      cells transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding the TARP-TCR proliferated well
      when exposed to peptide-specific stimuli. These cells exerted peptide-specific
      IFN-gamma production and cytotoxic activity. Importantly, HLA-A2(+) prostate and 
      breast cancer cells expressing TARP were also killed, demonstrating that the
      TARP(4-13) epitope is a physiologically relevant target for T-cell therapy of
      prostate and breast cancer. In conclusion, we present the cloning of a T cell
      receptor (TCR) directed against a physiologically relevant HLA-A2 epitope of
      TARP. To our knowledge this report on engineering of T cells with a TCR directed 
      against an antigen specifically expressed by prostate cells is unique.

TI  - Role of photodynamic therapy in the palliation of obstructing esophageal cancer.
PG  - 278-84
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this non-randomized study was to determine the role
      of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in a multimodal approach for the palliation of
      advanced esophageal carcinoma. METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients with
      obstructing esophageal cancer were enrolled in this study. Each subject had
      dysphagia, and nine could not swallow fluid. External beam radiotherapy or a
      self-expandable metal stent was used following PDT for dysphagia due to
      recurrence of the malignancy. RESULTS: At 4 weeks post-PDT, a significant
      improvement in the dysphagia score was observed in 90% of patients, from 2.75 +/-
      0.91 to 1.05 +/- 0.83 (p < 0.05). Patients with recurrent dysphagia underwent
      stent insertion at an average of 63 days (range, 37 to 90). The rate of major
      complications was 10%. Two esophageal strictures occurred, which were treated by 
      placement of a modified expandable stent across the stricture. The median
      survival in these cases was 7.0 +/- 0.6 months. One patient that was treated with
      PDT and radiotherapy is alive and showed a complete tumor response. CONCLUSIONS: 
      PDT as a multimodality treatment is safe and effective for relieving malignant
      esophageal obstruction with minimal complications.

TI  - Clinical features of patients on home oxygen therapy due to chronic respiratory
      failure at one university hospital.
PG  - 311-6
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Home oxygen therapy (HOT) costs a great deal every year and
      demand for the service is growing. In Korea, health insurance has covered HOT
      since November 1, 2006. The objective of this study was to evaluate clinical
      features of patients who used long-term HOT due to chronic respiratory failure
      and to determine the appropriateness of oxygen prescriptions. METHODS: Between
      November 2006 and April 2010, patients prescribed long-term HOT were enrolled in 
      the study at a tertiary university referral hospital and their medical records
      and telephone survey information were evaluated. In total, 340 patients were
      evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: Regarding the initial indications for HOT,
      their mean PaO(2) was 49.8 mmHg and mean SpO(2) was 82.2%. Underlying diseases
      included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 19.8%), lung cancer
      (12.6%), and interstitial lung disease (11.2%). The admission rate within 1 year 
      was 53.4% and the average number of admissions was 1.64/patient. Other underlying
      diseases for which oxygen was prescribed, despite not meeting the insurance
      coverage criteria, were lung cancer (36.6%) and interstitial pneumonia (16.6%).
      CONCLUSIONS: Home oxygen prescriptions have increased since health insurance
      coverage was extended. However, cases of oxygen prescriptions frequently do not
      meet the coverage criteria. It is important to discuss extending the coverage
      criteria to other disease groups, such as interstitial lung disease and lung
      cancer, in terms of cost-effectiveness. Further, physicians prescribing oxygen
      therapy should be educated regarding the criteria.

TI  - Simultaneous xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis and gallbladder cancer in a
      patient with a large abdominal aortic aneurysm.
PG  - 338-41
AB  - There have been reports of the coexistence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)
      with intra-abdominal malignancy including gastric, colonic, pancreatic, and
      renal. We herein report a case of a previously undiagnosed AAA and a presenting
      complaint consistent with acute cholecystitis. Following cholecystectomy, this
      was noted to be a rare form of chronic cholecystitis: xanthogranulomatous
      cholecystitis. There is a known possible association of this uncommon condition
      with gallbladder cancer. The management of concomitant pathologies can present a 
      real challenge to the multidisciplinary team, especially with large aneurysms.

TI  - Inhibition of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia progression to carcinoma by
      nitric oxide-releasing aspirin in p48(Cre/+)-LSL-Kras(G12D/+) mice.
PG  - 778-87
AB  - Nitric oxide-releasing aspirin (NO-aspirin) represents a novel class of promising
      chemopreventive agents. Unlike conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
      NO-aspirin seems to be free of adverse effects while retaining the beneficial
      activities of its parent compound. The effect of NO-aspirin on pancreatic
      carcinogenesis was investigated by assessing the development of precursor
      pancreatic lesions and adenocarcinomas in Kras(G12D/+) transgenic mice that
      recapitulate human pancreatic cancer progression. Six-week-old male
      p48(Cre/+)-LSL-Kras(G12D/+) transgenic mice (20 per group) were fed diets
      containing 0, 1000, or 2000 ppm NO-aspirin. The development of pancreatic tumors 
      was monitored by positron emission tomography imaging. All mice were killed at
      the age of 41 weeks and assessed for pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN)
      and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and for molecular changes in the
      tumors. Our results reveal that NO-aspirin at 1000 and 2000 ppm significantly
      suppressed pancreatic tumor weights, PDAC incidence, and carcinoma in situ
      (PanIN-3 lesions). The degree of inhibition of PanIN-3 and carcinoma was more
      pronounced with NO-aspirin at 1000 ppm (58.8% and 48%, respectively) than with
      2000 ppm (47% and 20%, respectively). NO-aspirin at 1000 ppm significantly
      inhibited the spread of carcinoma in the pancreas ( approximately 97%; P <
      .0001). Decreased expression of cyclooxygenase (COX; with approximately 42%
      inhibition of total COX activity), inducible nitric oxide synthase, proliferating
      cell nuclear antigen, Bcl-2, cyclin D1, and beta-catenin was observed, with
      induction of p21, p38, and p53 in the pancreas of NO-aspirin-treated mice. These 
      results suggest that low-dose NO-aspirin possesses inhibitory activity against
      pancreatic carcinogenesis by modulating multiple molecular targets.

TI  - CAND1 promotes PLK4-mediated centriole overduplication and is frequently
      disrupted in prostate cancer.
PG  - 799-806
AB  - Centrosomes play a crucial role in the maintenance of genome stability by
      orchestrating bipolar mitotic spindle formation. The centrosome normally
      duplicates precisely once before mitosis in a process that is extensively
      regulated by protein degradation including SKP1-Cullin 1 (CUL1)-F-box (SCF) E3
      ubiquitin ligase activity. The core SCF component CUL1 has recently been found to
      be required to suppress the formation of supernumerary centrosomes and
      centrioles, the core-forming units of centrosomes. Here, we identify the
      CUL1-interacting protein cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1 (CAND1) 
      as a novel centrosomal protein with a role in centriole duplication control.
      CAND1 was found to synergize with Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4), a master regulator
      of centriole biogenesis, in the induction of centriole overduplication. We
      provide evidence that CAND1 functions in this process by increasing PLK4 protein 
      stability. Furthermore, mutants of CUL1 that lack the ability to interact with
      CAND1 and are unable to assemble functional E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes were
      impaired in their ability to restrain aberrant daughter centriole synthesis. To
      corroborate a role of CAND1 in human carcinogenesis, we analyzed a series of
      prostate adenocarcinomas and found altered expression of CAND1 on the mRNA or
      protein level in 52.9% and 40.8%, respectively, of the tumor samples analyzed.
      These results highlight the role of altered SCF components in cancer in general
      and encourage further studies to explore the SCF-CAND1 axis for the development
      of novel predictive biomarkers and therapeutic approaches in prostate cancer.

TI  - Alterations of phosphoproteins in NCI-H526 small cell lung cancer cells involved 
      in cytotoxicity of cisplatin and titanocene Y.
PG  - 813-22
AB  - First-line treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with combination
      chemotherapy consisting of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) and
      etoposide is frequently followed by early relapses and a dismal prognosis.
      Survival of a fraction of tumor cells and development of chemoresistance may be
      influenced by an initial cellular stress response against the administered
      xenobiotics. Therefore, we compared the short-term effects of cisplatin and
      non-cross-resistant bis-[(p-methoxybenzyl)cyclopentadienyl] titanium(IV)
      dichloride (Titanocene Y) on phosphorylation of 46 sites of a total of 38
      signaling proteins in tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53)-wild-type NCI-H526 SCLC
      cells. The functional significance of selected kinases for the cytotoxicity of
      both drugs was tested using specific inhibitors and an activator. The
      cisplatin-induced cellular stress response involved activation of p38alpha
      mitogen-activated protein kinase, whereas Titanocene Y-triggered signaling
      affected c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate
      (AMP)-activated protein kinase alpha1 (AMPKalpha1) was increased by both drugs,
      which promoted cell survival, as indicated by results obtained using AMPK
      inhibitor compound C and AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
      1-beta-d-ribofuranoside. This is in good agreement with previous reports, where
      AMPKalpha1 was demonstrated to represent an important factor for the sensitivity 
      to cisplatin in colon and ovarian cancers, most likely by induction of autophagy.
      Thus, AMPKalpha1 constitutes a potential target to be exploited for
      chemotherapeutic treatment of SCLC to circumvent resistance to metal-based
      compounds.

TI  - Metronomic ceramide analogs inhibit angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer through
      up-regulation of caveolin-1 and thrombospondin-1 and down-regulation of cyclin
      D1.
PG  - 833-45
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the antitumor and antiangiogenic activity of metronomic
      ceramide analogs and their relevant molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Human
      endothelial cells [human dermal microvascular endothelial cells and human
      umbilical vascular endothelial cell (HUVEC)] and pancreatic cancer cells (Capan-1
      and MIA PaCa-2) were treated with the ceramide analogs (C2, AL6, C6, and C8), at 
      low concentrations for 144 hours to evaluate any antiproliferative and
      proapoptotic effects and inhibition of migration and to measure the expression of
      caveolin-1 (CAV-1) and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) mRNAs by real-time reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Assessment of extracellular
      signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and Akt phosphorylation and of CAV-1
      and cyclin D1 protein expression was performed by ELISA. Maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) gemcitabine was compared against metronomic doses of the ceramide analogs
      by evaluating the inhibition of MIA PaCa-2 subcutaneous tumor growth in nude
      mice. RESULTS: Metronomic ceramide analogs preferentially inhibited cell
      proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in endothelial cells. Low concentrations of 
      AL6 and C2 caused a significant inhibition of HUVEC migration. ERK1/2 and Akt
      phosphorylation were significantly decreased after metronomic ceramide analog
      treatment. Such treatment caused the overexpression of CAV-1 and TSP-1 mRNAs and 
      proteins in endothelial cells, whereas cyclin D1 protein levels were reduced. The
      antiangiogenic and antitumor impact in vivo of metronomic C2 and AL6 regimens was
      similar to that caused by MTD gemcitabine. CONCLUSIONS: Metronomic C2 and AL6
      analogs have antitumor and antiangiogenic activity, determining the up-regulation
      of CAV-1 and TSP-1 and the suppression of cyclin D1.

TI  - Apicidin and docetaxel combination treatment drives CTCFL expression and HMGB1
      release acting as potential antitumor immune response inducers in metastatic
      breast cancer cells.
PG  - 855-67
AB  - Currently approved combination regimens available for the treatment of metastatic
      tumors, such as breast cancer, have been shown to increase response rates, often 
      at the cost of a substantial increase in toxicity. An ideal combination strategy 
      may consist of agents with different mechanisms of action leading to
      complementary antitumor activities and safety profiles. In the present study, we 
      investigated the effects of the epigenetic modulator apicidin in combination with
      the cytotoxic agent docetaxel in tumor breast cell lines characterized by
      different grades of invasiveness. We report that combined treatment of apicidin
      and docetaxel, at low toxicity doses, stimulates in metastatic breast cancer
      cells the expression of CTCF-like protein and other cancer antigens, thus
      potentially favoring an antitumor immune response. In addition, apicidin and
      docetaxel co-treatment specifically stimulates apoptosis, characterized by an
      increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-8 activation. Importantly, following
      combined exposure to these agents, metastatic cells were also found to induce
      signals of immunogenic apoptosis such as cell surface expression of calreticulin 
      and release of considerable amounts of high-mobility group box 1 protein, thus
      potentially promoting the translation of induced cell death into antitumor immune
      response. Altogether, our results indicate that the combined use of apicidin and 
      docetaxel, at a low toxicity profile, may represent a potential innovative
      strategy able to activate complementary antitumor pathways in metastatic breast
      cancer cells, associated with a potential control of metastatic growth and
      possible induction of antitumor immunity.

TI  - MiR-9, -31, and -182 deregulation promote proliferation and tumor cell survival
      in colon cancer.
PG  - 868-79
AB  - Several microRNAs (miRNAs) are known to be deregulated in colon cancer, but the
      mechanisms behind their potential involvement on proliferation and tumor cell
      survival are unclear. The present study aimed to identify miRNAs with functional 
      implications for development of colon cancer. The cell proliferation and
      apoptosis were examined following perturbations of miRNA levels by employing a
      comprehensive miRNA library screen. miRNAs nominated for relevance to colon
      cancer were validated on expression and functional levels. By integrating the
      effect of miRNA up-regulation with the endogenous miRNA expression levels within 
      the HT29, HCT116, and SW480 colon cancer cell lines, we identified miRNAs
      controlling cell proliferation (n = 53) and apoptosis (n = 93). From these
      functionally nominated miRNAs, we narrowed the list to 10 oncogene- and 20 tumor 
      suppressor-like miRNAs that were also differentially expressed between colon
      cancer (n = 80) and normal colonic mucosa (n = 20). The differential expressions 
      of miR-9, miR-31, and miR-182 were successfully validated in a series of colon
      carcinomas (n = 30) and polyps (n = 10) versus normal colonic mucosa (n = 10),
      whereas the functional effect was confirmed in an in-depth validation using
      different cell viability and apoptotic markers. Several transcription factors and
      genes regulating cell proliferation were identified as putative target genes by
      integrative miRNA/mRNA expression analysis obtained from the same colon cancer
      patient samples. This study suggests that deregulated expression of miR-9,
      miR-31, and miR-182 during carcinogenesis plays a significant role in the
      development of colon cancer by promoting proliferation and tumor cell survival.

TI  - Targeting Notch, a key pathway for ovarian cancer stem cells, sensitizes tumors
      to platinum therapy.
PG  - E2939-48
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1206400109 [doi]
AB  - Chemoresistance to platinum therapy is a major obstacle that needs to be overcome
      in the treatment of ovarian cancer patients. The high rates and patterns of
      therapeutic failure seen in patients are consistent with a steady accumulation of
      drug-resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs). This study demonstrates that the Notch
      signaling pathway and Notch3 in particular are critical for the regulation of
      CSCs and tumor resistance to platinum. We show that Notch3 overexpression in
      tumor cells results in expansion of CSCs and increased platinum chemoresistance. 
      In contrast, gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI), a Notch pathway inhibitor, depletes
      CSCs and increases tumor sensitivity to platinum. Similarly, a Notch3 siRNA
      knockdown increases the response to platinum therapy, further demonstrating that 
      modulation of tumor chemosensitivity by GSI is Notch specific. Most importantly, 
      the cisplatin/GSI combination is the only treatment that effectively eliminates
      both CSCs and the bulk of tumor cells, indicating that a dual combination
      targeting both populations is needed for tumor eradication. In addition, we found
      that the cisplatin/GSI combination therapy has a synergistic cytotoxic effect in 
      Notch-dependent tumor cells by enhancing the DNA-damage response, G(2)/M
      cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Based on these results, we conclude that
      targeting the Notch pathway could significantly increase tumor sensitivity to
      platinum therapy. Our study suggests important clinical applications for
      targeting Notch as part of novel treatment strategies upon diagnosis of ovarian
      cancer and at recurrence. Both platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive relapses
      may benefit from such an approach as clinical data suggest that all relapses
      after platinum therapy are increasingly platinum resistant.

TI  - An immunosurveillance mechanism controls cancer cell ploidy.
PG  - 1678-84
AB  - Cancer cells accommodate multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations that
      initially activate intrinsic (cell-autonomous) and extrinsic (immune-mediated)
      oncosuppressive mechanisms. Only once these barriers to oncogenesis have been
      overcome can malignant growth proceed unrestrained. Tetraploidization can
      contribute to oncogenesis because hyperploid cells are genomically unstable. We
      report that hyperploid cancer cells become immunogenic because of a constitutive 
      endoplasmic reticulum stress response resulting in the aberrant cell surface
      exposure of calreticulin. Hyperploid, calreticulin-exposing cancer cells readily 
      proliferated in immunodeficient mice and conserved their increased DNA content.
      In contrast, hyperploid cells injected into immunocompetent mice generated tumors
      only after a delay, and such tumors exhibited reduced DNA content, endoplasmic
      reticulum stress, and calreticulin exposure. Our results unveil an
      immunosurveillance system that imposes immunoselection against hyperploidy in
      carcinogen- and oncogene-induced cancers.

TI  - Attitudes of medical oncologists in Qatar toward palliative care.
PG  - 548-51
LID - 10.1177/1049909112461168 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The first and only palliative care (PC) unit in Qatar was established
      in 2008 to serve adult patients with cancer. As PC was only recently introduced
      to oncology practice in Qatar and the region, raising awareness among physicians 
      is crucial. This survey study is designed to outline the level of awareness and
      knowledge of oncologists in Qatar toward PC. METHODS: In this cross-sectional
      survey study, copies of a self-constructed questionnaire were distributed to 49
      physicians at the National Center for Cancer Care and Research in Qatar during
      January 2012 and collected for data analysis. RESULTS: The physician response
      rate was 100%. Less than half of the responders (36.7%) had official training in 
      PC, but the majority (89.8%) showed interest in the field. Only 57.8% of the
      physicians reported self-competence in providing good PC to the dying patient. On
      the other hand, up to 69.4% are aware of the guidelines for pain relief and 58.7%
      apply them in their clinical practice. The concept of PC hospice was familiar to 
      77.1% of participants. On one hand, 85.7% of the physicians advocated that every 
      medical center should have PC service, while up to 70.8% preferred that patients 
      with short survival expectancy die in the community, rather than in a hospital
      setting. CONCLUSIONS: There is relatively good awareness and knowledge among
      health care providers specialized in cancer treatment in our hospital, despite
      the lack of formal training. Further training and informative sessions are
      required to raise awareness among oncologists and encourage utilization of PC
      services and thus optimize patient accessibility to PC.

TI  - Bacteria and Candida yeasts in inflammations of the oral mucosa in children with 
      secondary immunodeficiency.
PG  - 568-76
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral microbial flora and a damaged oral mucosa may increase the risk 
      of bacteriemia, fungemia and complications in immunocompromised patients. AIM OF 
      THE STUDY: Assessment of presence: bacteria and Candida spp. in different oral
      lesions, and the incidence of bacteremia in the case of a damaged mucosa in
      transplant recipients and patients receiving anti-tumour chemotherapy. MATERIAL
      AND METHOD: Forty-five patients - 18 months to 18 years of life, were included
      (20 - organ recipients, 14- anti-tumour chemotherapy, 11 - control group).
      Clinical, oral mucosa examination focused on the type, severity and site of
      lesions, and microbiology assessed the presence of bacteria and fungi in the
      material from lesions. Blood cultures were performed in ten immunocompromised
      patients with manifestations of systemic infection. The control material
      consisted of blood cultures made prior to the onset of oral lesions and after 4-6
      weeks following their remission in a diagnosed bacteremia. The statistical
      analysis was performed. RESULTS: In the subjects with secondary immunodeficiency,
      among other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS), Candidia spp. were more
      frequent. In cancer patients, mucositis was associated with Candida spp.,
      Streptococcus spp. Organ recipients with stomatitis exhibited the presence of
      CoNS, Streptococcus viridians and other. Oral lesions in the control group
      contained Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Neisseria spp. and Staphylococcus aureus.
      In 30% of immunocompromised patients, oral lesions were accompanied by
      bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS: A correlation has been found between oral lesions and
      the presence of S. aureus in patients without secondary immunodeficiency, and of 
      CoNS, Enterococcus spp., Candida spp. in immunocompromised patients.

TI  - The accuracy of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of breast pathology in
      symptomatic women.
PG  - 236-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading
      cause of cancer death among females, accounting for 23% of total cancer cases and
      14% of cancer deaths worldwide. The developing countries are catching up with
      this trend. Breast ultrasound when properly performed and interpreted, is an
      indispensable tool in breast imaging. The early diagnosis and treatment of breast
      masses reduces the morbidity and mortality associated with delayed diagnosis of
      breast carcinoma. The use of breast ultrasound is gaining ground in recent time, 
      this is due to current advances in ultrasound technology which permit greater
      spatial and contrast resolution and shortened scan time. OBJECTIVE: To determine 
      the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of ultrasound in the
      detection of palpable breast masses and to correlate the findings of ultrasound
      with the findings of fine needle aspiration cytology, or histopathology. METHODS:
      Breast ultrasound scanning was done in 100 patients with signs and symptoms of
      breast lesion referred from the Surgical out Patient Clinic to the Radiodiagnosis
      Department of Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH). Histology reports were
      collected from either the case note or Morbid Anatomy department to correlate the
      findings with ultrasound diagnosis. RESULTS: The mean age was 41.7 +/- 11.34
      (18-59) years. Symptoms of breast lesion were highest in the age group 41-50
      years 38 (38%), and least in 18-20 years 4 (4%). When the use of ultrasonography 
      was compared with the histopathology report in the diagnosis of breast lesion in 
      the studied population, the sensitivity was 100%, specificity (96.6%), accuracy
      (97%), posting predictive value (PPV) 81.3%, and negative predictive value (NPV) 
      100%. The accuracy, specificity and PPV however decreased with increasing age.
      CONCLUSION: Ultrasonography of the breast is useful in the diagnosis of breast
      lesions, because of the high sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic value it
      exhibited with histopathologic findings.

TI  - How height is related to our health and longevity: a review.
PG  - 247-61
LID - 10.1177/0260106013510996 [doi]
AB  - Most people believe that being taller and heavier is a sign of higher social
      status and privilege; however, an objective evaluation of the advantages and
      disadvantages of increased body size (excluding obesity) indicated that shorter, 
      smaller bodies have numerous advantages in terms of health and longevity. With
      healthful nutrition and lifestyles, and good medical care, shorter people are
      less likely to suffer from age-related chronic diseases and more likely to reach 
      advanced ages. A variety of biological factors explain the inherent benefits of
      smaller bodies. These include reduced cell replication, much lower DNA damage and
      reduced cancer incidence. Other beneficial factors include higher sex hormone
      binding globulin, higher insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1, lower
      insulin and lower insulin-like growth factor-1. We discuss recommendations for
      how taller people can minimize their risks. Future public health practices should
      focus on healthful nutrition, without promoting continued secular growth in
      height and weight.

TI  - Feasibility of linking population-based cancer registries and cancer center
      biorepositories.
PG  - 416-20
LID - 10.1089/bio.2012.0014 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Biospecimen-based research offers tremendous promise as a way to
      increase understanding of the molecular epidemiology of cancers. Population-based
      cancer registries can augment this research by providing more clinical detail and
      long-term follow-up information than is typically available from biospecimen
      annotations. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, we
      performed a pilot linkage between the California Cancer Registry (CCR) and the
      University of California, Davis Cancer Center Biorepository (UCD CCB) databases
      to determine if we could identify patients with records in both databases.
      METHODS: We performed a probabilistic data linkage between 2180 UCD CCB
      biospecimen records collected during the years 2005-2009 and all CCR records for 
      cancers diagnosed from 1988-2009 based on standard data linkage procedures.
      RESULTS: The 1040 UCD records with a unique medical record number, tissue site,
      and pathology date were linked to 3.3 million CCR records. Of these, 844 (81.2%) 
      were identified in both databases. Overall, record matches were highest (100%)
      for cancers of the cervix and testis/other male genital system organs. For the
      most common cancers, matches were highest for cancers of the lung and respiratory
      system (93%), breast (91.7%), and colon and rectum (89.5%), and lower for
      prostate (72.9%). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot linkage demonstrated that information
      on existing biospecimens from a cancer center biorepository can be linked
      successfully to cancer registry data. Linkages between existing biorepositories
      and cancer registries can foster productive collaborations and provide a
      foundation for virtual biorepository networks to support population-based
      biospecimen research.

TI  - The impact of under-recording on cervical cancer-related mortality rates in
      Colombia: an equity analysis involving comparison by provenance.
PG  - 912-22
LID - S0124-00642012001000002 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Comparing cervical cancer mortality rates in Colombian departments, as
      well as in urban and rural areas and examining the potential causes of any
      differences. METHODOLOGY: This was an ecologic study. Mortality due to cervical
      cancer was estimated from data collected between 2005 and 2008 by the Colombian
      National Statistics Bureau (DANE).This included overall mortality in Colombia,
      mortality by department and mortality by rural and urban area. DANE provided the 
      under-recording indicator for mortality by departments and the unmet basic needs 
      index. Spearman correlation coefficient was estimated for average mortality by
      department, unmet basic needs and under-recording variables. RESULTS: The overall
      annual mortality rate from 2005 to 2008 due to cervical cancer in Colombia ranged
      from 10 to 11.1 per 100,000 females. Mortality reported in urban areas was higher
      than in rural areas (10.3-11.7 cf 7.6-8.7). The lowest average mortality was
      reported from the Choco department (4.7) and the highest from Meta (18.2). An
      inverse correlation was found between average mortality by department and unmet
      basic needs. The 'under-reporting' indicator had an inverse correlation with
      mortality, meaning that departments having recording issues also reported lower
      mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: Health systems must adopt strategies designed to
      improve information systems for supporting decision-making and optimise the use
      of health resources, particularly for vulnerable populations and populations
      having unmet basic needs. Comparing mortality amongst departments and areas will 
      not lead to reliable conclusions in such under-recording conditions.

TI  - Comparative study on antiproliferation properties and cellular antioxidant
      activities of commonly consumed food legumes against nine human cancer cell
      lines.
PG  - 1287-96
LID - 10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.02.212 [doi]
AB  - The aims of this work were to compare health promoting effects of commonly
      consumed food legumes in terms of cancer cell proliferation inhibitory effects
      and cellular antioxidant activities (CAA). The CAA was evaluated by fluorescence 
      microplate reader based on in vitro animal cell cultivation. Antiproliferative
      properties were assayed by MTT method using in vitro cell culture system.
      Phytochemicals (including total phenolic, procyanidin, saponin and phytic acid)
      and chemical antioxidant activities (including DPPH free radical scavenging
      activity, oxygen radical absorbing capacity, peroxyl radical scavenging capacity 
      (PRSC)) were also determined for comparison purposes. The results showed that
      different types of legumes possessed considerable variations in their
      phytochemicals, as well as chemical and cellular antioxidant activities. Adzuki
      bean exhibited the strongest antiproliferative properties in a dose-dependent
      manner against all digestive system cancer cell lines (CAL27, AGS, HepG2, SW480
      and Caco-2), ovary cancer cell SK-OV-3 and breast cancer cell MCF-7 among all
      legumes tested. Black soybean exhibited the highest saponin, phytic acid content,
      PRSC values, and the strongest CAA values. These results indicate that commonly
      consumed food legumes may serve as an excellent dietary source of natural
      antioxidants for health promotion and cancer prevention.

TI  - Resveratrol metabolites have an antiproliferative effect on intestinal epithelial
      cancer cells.
PG  - 1385-91
LID - 10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.03.036 [doi]
AB  - Trans-resveratrol (RV) is an active polyphenol with numerous physiological
      properties including antitumour activity, especially in colon cancer. RV is
      metabolized in the intestine and then in the liver to sulphated and
      glucuronidated forms that are exported to target organs. After exerting their
      effects, they are eliminated in the urine and stools. There are few and
      contradictory findings on the biological effects of RV metabolites. On the basis 
      of RV metabolism, we selected three metabolites RV 3-O-sulphate, RV
      3-O-glucuronide and RV 4'-O-glucuronide, and studied their effects on cell growth
      inhibition, the cell cycle and apoptosis using human adenocarcinoma cell line
      (Caco-2 cell) cultures. Our results show that RV metabolites have an antioxidant 
      activity similar to that RV. Moreover, all metabolites inhibited cell growth in a
      concentration-dependent manner as well as [(3)H] thymidine incorporation.
      Furthermore, we observed an increase in the percentage of cell in G0/G1 phase
      induced by RV metabolite treatments, as well as the induction of apoptosis. On
      the basis of our results we propose, for the first time, that RV metabolites
      remain active after their biosynthesis, contributing to the health benefits
      attributed previously only to RV. These metabolites are a potential target for
      more research into the prevention and treatment of colon cancer.

AB  - Spices are rich sources of antioxidants due to the presence of phenols and
      flavonoids. In this study, the DNA protecting activity and inhibition of
      nicotine-induced cancer cell migration of 9 spices were analysed. Murine
      fibroblasts (3T3-L1) and human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells were pre-treated with 
      spice extracts and then exposed to H(2)O(2) and nicotine. The comet assay was
      used to analyse the DNA damage. Among the 9 spices, ginger, at 50 mug/ml
      protected against 68% of DNA damage in 3T3-L1 cells. Caraway, cumin and fennel
      showed statistically significant (p<0.05) DNA protecting activity. Treatment of
      MCF-7 cells with nicotine induced cell migration, whereas pre-treatment with
      spices reduced this migration. Pepper, long pepper and ginger exhibited a high
      rate of inhibition of cell migration. The results of this study prove that spices
      protect DNA and inhibit cancer cell migration.

TI  - Stage at diagnosis, clinicopathological and treatment patterns of breast cancer
      at Bugando Medical Centre in north-western Tanzania.
PG  - 269-79
AB  - Breast cancer, although reported to be the commonest female malignancy worldwide 
      has not been extensively studied in north-western Tanzania. The aim of this
      retrospective review was to describe in our setting, the stage at diagnosis,
      clinicopathological and treatment patterns among patients with breast cancer.
      Data were analyzed using SPSS software system. A total of 384 patients were
      studied. The median age was 45 years (range 21 to 78 years). The male to female
      ratio was 1: 46.8. Most of the patients were premenopausal (63.8%) and presented 
      late with advanced breast cancer disease. Majority of patients (63.0%) presented 
      with stage III disease. Lymph node and distant metastasis at the time of
      diagnosis was reported in 70.8% and 21.4% of patients, respectively. Invasive
      ductal carcinoma (91.7%) was the most frequent histopathological type and most
      patients (63.8%) had poorly differentiated tumour. Patients with tumour size
      greater than 6cm had significantly high rate of lymph node metastasis (P=0.001)
      and presence of necrosis within the tumour (P=0.012) compared to patients with
      tumour size less than 6cm in diameter. Patients younger than 45 years had
      significantly high rate of lymph node metastasis compared to the patients above
      this age (P=0.0 11). Mastectomy was the main modality of treatment that was used 
      in 99.5% of the patients. Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy was reported in 
      44.8% and 11.7% of patients, respectively. Hormonal therapy (tamoxifen) was given
      postoperatively to all patients. The overall five-year survival rate was 21.8%.
      The age of patient at diagnosis, stage of disease, extent of lymph node
      involvement and histological grade were found to be independent predictors of
      overall survival rate (P<0.001). Local recurrence was 17.7% and it was
      significantly related to the stage of disease (P=0.003) and non-adherent to
      adjuvant therapy (P=0.021). Breast cancer patients in this region are relatively 
      young premenopausal women and mostly present late with advanced stage and high
      rate of lymph node metastasis. There is need to improve public enlightenment of
      breast cancer and set up screening centres to encourage early presentations.

TI  - Early Marjolin's ulcer developing in a penile human bite scar of an adult patient
      presenting at Bugando Medical Centre, Tanzania: A case report.
PG  - 288-92
AB  - Marjolin's ulcer is a rare but well documented cutaneous malignancy that arises
      in a scar or chronic ulcer, and is characterized by an aggressive course. The
      latent period from the injury to the appearance of cancer has been reported to be
      25-40 years. Early occurring Marjolin's ulcer has rarely been described in the
      literature and its development in a penile human bite scar is still rare. We
      report a rare case of a 33 year-old patient who presented with an early
      appearance of Marjolin's ulcer developing in a penile human bite scar. On
      histological examination it was found to be poorly differentiated squamous cell
      carcinoma. He was managed by total penile amputation. Five months after surgery, 
      the patient presented to our surgical outpatient clinic with inguinal lymph node 
      metastases and distant metastases to the lung, liver and bones. However, the
      patient died shortly after admission. This report highlights the possibility of
      early appearance of Marjolin's ulcer arising from a chronic ulcer or healed scar 
      in an unusual sites such as the penis. It is therefore recommended that all
      chronic ulcers should be thoroughly investigated at presentation, to avoid
      labelling malignancies 'chronic ulcers', leading to delay in appropriate
      treatment. Early recognition and aggressive treatment of Marjolin's ulcers and
      close follow-up are urgently needed to improve outcomes in our environment.

TI  - [Clinical study of effect of penehyclidine hydrochloride and atropine sequential 
      therapy in the treatment of severe acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning].
PG  - 349-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical efficacy of penehyclidine hydrochloride
      sequential to atropine in severe acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning
      (AOPP). METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 180 patients
      with severe AOPP admitted to the Emergency Center of Wuwei City People's Hospital
      from January 2007 to August 2011 was conducted. The patients were divided into
      penehyclidine hydrochloride sequential to atropine group, atropine group and
      penehyclidine hydrochloride group according to difference of anti-choline drugs
      using, with 60 cases in each group. The complication rate, time of recovery of
      cholinesterase (ChE) activity to 70, hospital stay time and cost, the cure rate, 
      mortality rate in three groups were analyzed. RESULTS: In penehyclidine
      hydrochloride sequential to atropine group, except for 1 case of cancer of
      gastric cardia with poisoning after operation showing intermediate syndrome of
      poisoning, the remaining patients did not have any complication, and the
      incidence of complications was 1.67.No death occurred in all the patients, and
      the cure rate was 100.00.Time of recovery from ChE activity to 70 was (4.0 +/-
      1.1 ) days; hospital stay was (7.0 + 2.2) days; hospital expenses were (6268 +/- 
      238 ) yuan. In atropine group, 3 patients were found to have atropine resistance,
      3 patients showed intermediate syndrome, rebound was observed in 2 cases,
      atropine poisoning in 2 patients, and the incidence of complications was
      16.67.Three patients died of respiratory or circulatory failure, and the
      mortality rate was 5.00.Fifty-seven patients were cured, the cure rate was
      95.00.The time of ChE activity recovery to 70 was (8.0 +/- 0.9) days. Hospital
      stay was (12.0 +/- 2.1) days. Hospital expenses were (7160 +/- 110) yuan. In
      penehyclidine hydrochloride group, 1 patient was found to have respiratory
      failure, 1 case suffered from pulmonary edema, and the complication rate was
      3.33.Two patients died, the mortality rate wan 3.33.Fifty-eight patients were
      cured, the cure rate was 96.67.The time of ChE activity recovery to 70 was (6.0
      +/- 0.7) days, hospital stay was (9.0 +/- 1.5) days, and hospital expenses were
      (7921 +/- 230) yuan. Compared with atropine group, penehyclidine hydrochloride
      sequential to atropine group had a low death rate, high cure rate, less
      complications, ChE activity recover fast, short hospital days, and the
      hospitalization expenses were lower than that of the single use of atropine or
      single use of penehyclidine hydrochloride group, and the differences were
      statistically significant (all P0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In treatment of severe AOPP
      by penehyclidine hydrochloride sequential to atropine, curative effect was more
      significant, with fewer adverse reactions, short hospital stay, and lower cost.

TI  - Screening and early diagnosis of prostate cancer: an update.
PG  - 270-5
AB  - Screening for prostate cancer has become a main controversial topic. First the
      currently used screening tools, PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) and DRE (Digital 
      Rectal Examination) have a low accuracy in the prediction of prostate cancer.
      Second, the benefit of screening in reducing the prostate cancer related
      mortality was not uniformly shown in older screening studies and there was
      concern about the risk of overdiagnosis and over-treatment of insignificant
      prostate cancers. Very recently, 3 major prospective, randomized screening
      studies have been published. This paper aims to provide an overview how the
      performance of the current screening tools can be ameliorated and evaluates the
      recently published screening studies with practical considerations for future
      screening protocols.

TI  - [Meta-analysis on treatment of non-small cell lung cancer with brucea javanica
      oil emulsion in combination with platinum-contained first-line chemotherapy].
PG  - 2022-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy and safety of brucea javanica oil emulsion
      (BJOE) combining platinum-contained first-line chemotherapy in treating non small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHOD: Cochrane library, PubMed, EMBASE, VIP, CBM and 
      CNKI were searched through computers. The search was finished in February, 2011. 
      Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of BJOE combining platinum-contained
      first-line chemotherapy were included. Two researchers extracted data and assess 
      literature quality separately,and made a meta-analyses by RevMan 5.1.2 software. 
      RESULT: Totally 22 RCTs involving 1512 patients were included. The Meta-analysis 
      showed that compared with the pure application of platinum-contained first-line
      chemotherapy,the combination of BJOE and chemotherapy can enhance the near-term
      curative effect (RR = 1. 31, 95% CI: 1.18-1.45, P < 0. 000 01), improve the
      quality of life (RR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.51-2. 09, P < 0.00001) and reduce the
      suppression of bone marrow (OR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0. 27-0. 51, P < 0.00001) and the 
      gastrointestinal reactions (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.44-0.80, P = 0.0007) ,with an
      improvement in organism immunity. CONCLUSION: The current evidence indicates that
      BJOE can enhance the chemotherapeutic effect on NSCLC patients, improve the
      quality of life and reduce adverse effect of platinum-contained chemotherapeutics
      and thus it is worth referring in clinic.

TI  - [The correlation between adrenal corticosteroids and cytokines expressions in
      mice of different syndromes].
PG  - 986-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the cytokines expressions in the adrenal gland and its
      correlation with serum adrenal corticosteroids in mice of different syndromes.
      METHODS: Using the quantitative four diagnosis and syndrome differentiation
      methods, 60 normal mice and 190 H22 liver cancer bearing mice were syndrome
      typed. Serum corticosterone and aldosterone were tested by ELISA, and mRNA
      expressions of cytokines in the adrenal gland were detected using Real-time PCR. 
      RESULTS: Mice of different syndromes were obtained, such as normal mice of no
      syndrome, normal mice of vigorous qi syndrome, normal mice of qi deficiency
      syndrome, liver cancer bearing mice of excessive evil toxic syndrome, liver
      cancer bearing mice of evil lying in the middle syndrome, liver cancer bearing
      mice of weak evil toxic syndrome, and liver cancer bearing mice of poisonous
      pathogenic factors and qi deficiency syndrome. The serum corticosteroids were
      significantly higher in the liver cancer bearing mice than in the normal mice (P 
      < 0.05). The cortex hormones increased most significantly in the liver cancer
      bearing mice of excessive evil toxic syndrome (P < 0.05). Compared with the
      normal mice, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12alpha, IL-12beta, and TNF-alpha
      gene expressions increased in the liver cancer bearing mice, while only
      expressions of IL-1alpha and IL-5 decreased. But the expressions of IL-13 and
      transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) showed no regularity. The
      expressions of IL-4 and INF-alpha were not detected in all mice. It is notable
      that the more severe degree of poisonous pathogenic factors, the higher the
      expressions of serum corticosterone and aldosterone levels as well as IL-6, the
      lower expressions of IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-5, IL-12alpha, IL-12beta, and TNF-alpha. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The increased serum corticosteroid level in liver cancer bearing
      mice could possibly be induced by chronic tumor stress, partial cytokines were
      involved in the synthesis and secretion of the adrenal hormone. Of them, IL-6
      might positively regulate the secretion of corticosteroids, while IL-1beta, IL-2,
      IL-5, IL-12alpha, IL-12beta, and TNF-alpha might negatively regulate their
      secretions.

TI  - Past obstetric history and risk of ovarian cancer.
PG  - 385-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early age at menarche and late age at last menstrual period, as
      well as other reproductive factors, may be the cause of development of some types
      of cancer concerning the female reproductive organs. It has been estimated that
      late menopause may be responsible for the occurrence of even 16% of cases of
      ovarian cancer in the population. The incidence of ovarian cancer is also higher 
      among nulliparous women, and among those who rarely become pregnant. OBJECTIVE:
      The objective of the study was analysis of the effect of reproductive factors on 
      the risk of ovarian cancer. METHODOLOGY: The study covered healthy women, without
      the diagnosis of focal lesions in the ovaries, and women with the diagnosis of
      ovarian cancer. The study was conducted during the period from September
      2007-November 2011, and covered a total number of 1,346 women. Odds ratio was
      calculated for individual risk factors. Statistical analysis was performed by
      means of the statistical packages STATISTICA v8, GrafPad Instat v 3.00,
      Analyse-it v. 2.2, and Cytel Studio StatXact-8. Statistical hypothesis were
      verified on the level of significance p </= 0.05. RESULTS: Among females who
      began menstruating by the age of 11, the risk of ovarian cancer was 1.6 higher
      than among those in whom the first period occurred at the age of over 13.
      Similarly, among women who menstruated at the age of over 55 the risk of
      development of ovarian cancer was 1.4 times higher. The age at which a woman
      delivered her first live baby is also of importance. In the group of women who
      gave birth at the age of over 35, the risk was elevated and remained on the level
      of OR=1.7; 95%CI 0.66-4.5, compared to those who bore the first baby under the
      age of 25. If the pregnancy was terminated with miscarriage, the risk of
      contracting ovarian cancer decreases, and was on the level of OR=0.8; 95%CI
      0.53-1.28, compared to the women who have never been pregnant. Among patients who
      did not breastfeed their babies, ovarian cancer risk was 1.7 times higher,
      compared to those breastfeeding. CONCLUSION: Reproductive factors exert a
      significant effect of the risk of development of ovarian cancer.

TI  - Psychosocial aspect of quality of life of Polish women with breast cancer.
PG  - 509-12
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is one of the most frequently occurring
      malignant tumours among women in Poland. The highest incidence of the disease is 
      registered among women aged 50 and more. Cancer imposes a considerable
      psychological strain on a woman. It causes a sense of uncertainty about one's
      health and further life, as well as frequent problems with accepting the image of
      one's own body. It often results in low self-esteem and a feeling of
      embarrassment, accompanied by symptoms of apathy and detachment. The aim of the
      study was to determine mental and social life quality of Polish women treated for
      breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research encompassed 107 women aged
      between 45 and 65 (SD=6.11) undergoing treatment for breast cancer. The
      WHOQOL-Bref scale was applied in the research. RESULTS: The social field was
      better evaluated in comparison with the mental sphere. There was a statistical
      correlation between place of residence and social sphere of quality of life
      (p=,036), with higher ratings assigned by respondents residing in rural areas
      (M=15.36) compared with residents of towns (M=14.15). CONCLUSIONS: Given the fact
      that respondents were coping with cancer or its consequences, paradoxically,
      perception of the overall quality of life and examined areas was generally good, 
      especially among women with higher education, those who were single and those
      living in rural areas. Along with age, there decreases at the respondents the
      experienced quality of life, however a rise of evaluations of the mental sphere
      is accompanying the rise in the education level.

TI  - Oral hygiene in children suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia living in
      rural and urban regions.
PG  - 529-33
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: During acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment, oral
      mucositis is a hugely important dental problem. In order to lower the risk of
      such complications, patients should take special care of their oral hygiene. The 
      aim of this study was to assess the oral hygiene status in children with ALL
      during anti-cancer treatment protocols. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 78 children with
      ALL who were examined in 3 stages, and 78 generally healthy children, who
      constituted the control group, participated in the study. In the group of
      patients were 55 children from the rural environment and 23 children living in
      towns. Oral hygiene status was assessed with the use of the Oral Hygiene
      Simplified Index, Plaque Index, and Gingival Index. RESULTS: The average value of
      OHI-S index in children with ALL before the chemotherapy was 0.64 +/- 0.85, the
      value of the Pl.I index was 0.59 +/- 0.74, GI index value was 0.08 +/- 0.34. In
      the period from 0.5-1.5 years, the anti-cancer therapy value indicators of oral
      hygiene in children with ALL developed as follows: OHI-S--0.49 +/- 0.69,
      Pl.I--0.49 +/- 0.67, GI--0.02 +/- 0.13. CONCLUSIONS: Oral hygiene was
      significantly better in children with ALL than in children in the control group. 
      The better condition of oral hygiene in children with ALL than children in the
      control group is the result of the oral hygiene regime that the children were
      following during cancer treatment protocols. Significantly higher GI in children 
      with ALL, compared to children from the control group, was observed despite the
      better oral hygiene.

TI  - Evaluation of prognostic parameters of E-cadherin status in breast cancer
      treatment.
PG  - 541-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is one of the most frequent
      malignancies in women. Axillary lymph node involvement, tumour size, receptor
      status, and level of malignancy are the most significant prognostic factors in
      breast cancer, but insufficient to date. More factors are needed for establishing
      the prognosis and treatment in these patients. The aim of the presented study was
      evaluation of E-cadherin expression and its prognostic value among 89 specimens
      of breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 89 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded 
      breast cancer specimens were studied for expression of E-cadherin detected by
      immunohistochemistry. During 10-year observation overall/OS/and disease-free
      survival/DFS/of patients were assessed. RESULTS: Average of OS and DFS were
      shorter among patients without expression of E-cadherin in comparison to survival
      time of patients with expression of E-cadherin. The lack of E-cadherin expression
      was present more often among patients with distant metastasis. No essential
      changes were noticed in the level of E-cadherin depending on the size of the
      tumour, G, presence of metastasis into the lymph nodes, ER, PR and HER-2,
      hormonal condition and presence of cancerous tissues in lymphatic vessels and the
      infiltration of lymph nodes capsules. CONCLUSIONS: E-cadherin may play an
      important role in the prognosis of breast cancer patients.

TI  - Associations among patient characteristics, health-related quality of life, and
      spiritual well-being among Arab Muslim cancer patients.
PG  - 1321-4
LID - 10.1089/jpm.2012.0208 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite Islam being the world's second largest religion and despite
      the fact that there are 22 Arabic-speaking nations representing North Africa and 
      the Middle East, little is known about the relationship between spiritual
      well-being and health-related quality of life (HrQoL) for Arabic-speaking Muslims
      in treatment for cancer. AIM: The study's aim was to determine whether spiritual 
      well-being is correlated with HrQoL and whether participants' age, sex, marital
      status, site of cancer, and stage of disease are related to spiritual well-being.
      DESIGN: Using a cross-sectional design, a total of 159 Arabic-speaking,
      study-eligible cancer patients who were in treatment at the King Hussein Cancer
      Center (KHCC), Amman, Jordan, completed three questionnaires: a demographic
      questionnaire; the Functional Assessment in Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G),
      which assesses the physical, social, functional, and emotional domains of HrQoL; 
      and the Functional Assessment in Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-being
      (FACIT-Sp). RESULTS: Physical well-being was negatively correlated with the
      FACIT-Sp for men, divorced, and stage IV disease. Social Well-being was
      positively correlated with the FACIT-Sp for ages 18-34 and 35-49 years; both
      sexes; married, never married, and divorced; breast, bone/sarcoma, and
      gastrointestinal cancers; and stages II-IV. Emotional Well-being was negatively
      correlated with the FACIT-Sp for ages 35-49; males; never married; and stages III
      and IV. Functional Well-being was positively correlated with the FACIT-Sp for
      ages 35-49 and 50-64; both sexes; married or never married; and stages II and
      III. Age and cancer site showed a positive relationship with spiritual
      well-being. CONCLUSIONS: The FACIT-Sp distinguishes between domains of HrQoL and 
      patient characteristics. Further study on the unique contribution of the
      FACIT-Sp's Peace and Meaning subscales to HrQoL is needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The risk of a subsequent cancer is an important issue for patients
      with melanoma. The development of a second primary cancer in patients with a
      solitary melanoma has been discussed in several studies. However, to our
      knowledge, the incidence of second primary cancer (SPC) in patients with multiple
      primary melanoma (MPM) has not been thoroughly investigated. AIM: To quantify the
      incidence of SPC in patients with MPM, with the aim of possibly developing
      further preventive measures. METHODS: In a retrospective study, 76 patients with 
      MPM were identified from 2155 patients being followed up at our unit. RESULTS: Of
      the 76 patients, 12 (16%) developed another neoplasm, with 59% of them having
      nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), and 41% other noncutaneous cancers. By contrast, 
      only 8% of those with single primary melanoma had other neoplasms (21% of whom
      had NMSC). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MPM, especially men with skin phototype II,
      have a significantly increased incidence of developing SPC, particularly NMSC.
      Thus, careful monitoring is essential not only to detect recurrence of the
      original cancer or development of another primary melanoma, but also development 
      of new malignancies of different types, particularly NMSC.

LID - 10.1111/myc.12010 [doi]
AB  - Mucormycosis has emerged as an increasingly important infection in oncology
      centres with high mortality, especially in severely immunocompromised patients.
      We carried out a retrospective study of 11 children with mucormycosis treated in 
      seven French oncology-haematology paediatric wards during the period from 1991 to
      2011. Lichtheimia corymbifera and Mucor spp. were the predominant pathogens.
      Treatment regimens included antifungal therapy, reversal of underlying
      predisposing risk factors and surgical debridement. Although mucormycosis is
      associated with high mortality, this infection could be cured in eight of our
      cases of severely immunocompromised paediatric cancer patients.

TI  - Trastuzumab emtansine for HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.
PG  - 1783-91
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1209124 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate
      incorporating the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted
      antitumor properties of trastuzumab with the cytotoxic activity of the
      microtubule-inhibitory agent DM1. The antibody and the cytotoxic agent are
      conjugated by means of a stable linker. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients
      with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer, who had previously been treated with
      trastuzumab and a taxane, to T-DM1 or lapatinib plus capecitabine. The primary
      end points were progression-free survival (as assessed by independent review),
      overall survival, and safety. Secondary end points included progression-free
      survival (investigator-assessed), the objective response rate, and the time to
      symptom progression. Two interim analyses of overall survival were conducted.
      RESULTS: Among 991 randomly assigned patients, median progression-free survival
      as assessed by independent review was 9.6 months with T-DM1 versus 6.4 months
      with lapatinib plus capecitabine (hazard ratio for progression or death from any 
      cause, 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.77; P<0.001), and median
      overall survival at the second interim analysis crossed the stopping boundary for
      efficacy (30.9 months vs. 25.1 months; hazard ratio for death from any cause,
      0.68; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.85; P<0.001). The objective response rate was higher with
      T-DM1 (43.6%, vs. 30.8% with lapatinib plus capecitabine; P<0.001); results for
      all additional secondary end points favored T-DM1. Rates of grade 3 or 4 adverse 
      events were higher with lapatinib plus capecitabine than with T-DM1 (57% vs.
      41%). The incidences of thrombocytopenia and increased serum aminotransferase
      levels were higher with T-DM1, whereas the incidences of diarrhea, nausea,
      vomiting, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia were higher with lapatinib plus
      capecitabine. CONCLUSIONS: T-DM1 significantly prolonged progression-free and
      overall survival with less toxicity than lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients 
      with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and
      a taxane. (Funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech; EMILIA ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Independent predictors of survival and the impact of repeat surgery in patients
      undergoing surgical treatment of spinal metastasis.
PG  - 565-76
LID - 10.3171/2012.8.SPINE12449 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: Surgery for spinal metastasis is considered palliative, and postoperative
      survival is often less than a year. Recurrence of metastatic lesions is quite
      common, and it remains unclear whether repeat surgery is effective. In this
      study, the authors assessed independent predictors for survival at 6 months, 1
      year, and 2 years after surgery, and examined whether repeat surgery for
      recurrence of spinal metastasis influenced survival rates. METHODS: Retrospective
      review of the electronic medical records was performed to identify a consecutive 
      population of adult patients who underwent surgery for spinal metastasis during
      the period 2005-2011. Utilizing a Cox proportional hazard regression model, the
      authors assessed independent predictors and risk factors for survival at 6
      months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. In addition, the impact of repeat
      surgery on survival was specifically assessed via multivariable analysis.
      RESULTS: A total of 99 patients were included in the final analysis. The overall 
      mean postoperative duration of survival was 9.6 months. In addition to previously
      identified predictors of survival (preoperative ambulation, Karnofsky Performance
      Status [KPS], radiotherapy, primary cancer type, presence of extraspinal
      metastasis, and number of spinal segments with metastasis), pain on presentation 
      and body mass index (BMI) of 25-30 were both independently associated with
      survival. Patients with recurrence who underwent repeat surgery had longer mean
      survival times than patients with recurrence who did not undergo repeat surgery
      (19.6 months vs 12.8 months, respectively). Repeat surgery was also independently
      associated with higher survival rates on multivariate analysis. Follow-up KPS was
      significantly higher in patients who underwent repeat surgery as well.
      CONCLUSIONS: In addition to confirming previously identified predictors of
      survival following surgery for spinal metastasis, the authors identified BMI and 
      pain on presentation as independent predictors of survival. They also found that 
      repeat surgery may be a viable option in patients with metastatic recurrence and 
      may offer prolonged survival, likely due to improved functionality, mitigating
      complications associated with immobility.

      human gastric cancer cells via PARP and p53 signal pathways.

AB  - Cochinchina momordica seed is the dried ripe seed of Momordica cochinchinensis
      (Lour.) Spreng, which is a kind of fruit and consumed for dietary as well as
      medicinal uses. In this study, using the human SGC7901 and MKN-28 gastric cancer 
      cell lines, we explored the anticancer activity of the extract from cochinchina
      momordica seed (ECMS). ECMS inhibited significantly the survival rates of SGC7901
      and MKN-28 cells in concentration- and time-dependent manners by MTT assay. The
      typical apoptotic morphological changes were observed by Hoechst 33258 dye assay 
      after SGC7901 and MKN-28 cells were treated with ECMS for 48 h. Flow cytometry
      analysis revealed that ECMS-treatment blocked the cells at the S phase of cell
      cycle. Furthermore, the protein expression levels of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
      (PARP) and Bcl-2 were downregulated notably by ECMS-treatment, whereas those of
      Fas/Fas-associated death domain, p53, and Bax were upregulated in SGC7901 cells. 
      ECMS dramatically enhanced the enzymatic activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9
      whilst slightly increased caspase-8 activity. Taken together, this study
      demonstrated that ECMS exerted cytotoxic activities via PARP and p53 signal
      pathways in the human gastric cancer cells.

      are interrelated in pancreatic cancer patients.
PG  - 602-7
LID - 10.3109/00365513.2012.723135 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic cancer has an extremely dismal clinical course and high
      fatality rate. Knowing that, adipokines could regulate insulin resistance,
      inflammation, immunity and carcinogenesis. Accordingly, an understanding of
      adipokines in relation to pancreatic cancer could be useful to improve disease
      outcome. We aimed to determine serum retinol binding protein-4 (RBP-4) and
      neutophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels in pancreatic cancer
      patients. Moreover, we assessed their association with tumor severity and with
      each other. METHODS: A total of 23 pancreatic cancer patients and 20 healthy
      controls were enrolled. Fifteen of the pancreatic cancer patients underwent
      Whipple resection and were examined before and after operation. Serum glucose,
      insulin, lipid profile, CA19-9, RBP-4 and NGAL were estimated by ELISA. RESULTS: 
      Significant elevation in serum concentrations of RBP-4 (64.4 +/- 5.6 ng/ml) and
      NGAL (142(80-235) ng/ml) at p < 0.001 was found in pancreatic cancer patients.
      Both RBP-4 and NGAL were significantly lower after operation than before
      operation. Moreover, NGAL was elevated in advanced pathological T stage.
      Interestingly, RBP-4 and NGAL levels were positively correlated (r = 0.484, p =
      0.05) and they are associated with some of the lipid profile parameters.
      CONCLUSIONS: Elevated serum RBP-4 and NGAL are associated with pancreatic cancer.
      They were positively interrelated; highlighting the possible interplay between
      them in pancreatic cancer.

AB  - The clinical application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) as a diagnostic tool
      has become increasingly evident. The coupling of NGS technologies with new
      genomic sequence enrichment methods has made the sequencing of panels of target
      genes technically feasible, at the same time as making such an approach
      cost-effective for diagnostic applications. In this article, we discuss recent
      studies that have applied NGS in the diagnostic setting in relation to hereditary

TI  - Anti-breast cancer agents from Chinese herbal medicines.
PG  - 101-5
AB  - Chinese Herbal Medicines (CHM) have been used in disease prevention and treatment
      for centuries in China. A number of anti-breast cancer agents isolated from CHM
      recently, showed very interesting structures, although some of the mechanism of
      action is not quite clear. These unique chemical structures could be an important
      information resource for new anti-breast cancer drugs' design and discovery. This
      review summarizes these findings on anti-breast cancer agents from CHM.

TI  - Positive association between a glutathione-S-transferase polymorphism and
      lymphoma in dogs.
PG  - 227-36
LID - 10.1111/vco.12000 [doi]
AB  - Glutathione-S-transferase enzymes (GSTs) play an important role in the
      detoxification of environmental carcinogens. Defective GST genotypes are
      over-represented in human cancers; in particular, low activity GSTT1 genotypes
      are risk factors for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We hypothesized that defective GSTT1
      genotypes would be associated with lymphoma risk in dogs. To address this, we
      resequenced the exons, splice junctions, and 3'-UTR of canine GSTT1 in dogs with 
      lymphoma (n = 93) and age-matched unaffected dogs (n = 86). Of 27 canine GSTT1
      variants identified, the I2+28 G>A was significantly associated with lymphoma
      [odds ratio (OR) 6.26, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.77-22.2], with the AA
      genotype found in 18.3% of affected dogs but only 3.5% of controls (P = 0.002).
      This intronic variant was predicted to perturb GSTT1 mRNA splicing, and may
      increase lymphoma risk by impairing detoxification of environmental chemicals.
      Confirmation of this finding in a larger population of dogs may support the
      inclusion of GSTT1 genotyping in epidemiologic studies of canine lymphoma risk.

      by cross-linking alginic acid moiety using Ca(2+). It was found that these
      alginic acid nanoparticles have a spherical morphology with the diameter of about
      100 nm, and negatively charged surface with the zeta potential of about -30 mV.
      Compared to the desintegrity of un-cross-linked nanoparticles, the
      Ca(2+)-cross-linked nanoparticles maintained their integrity in the aqueous
      medium with the physiological pH value. Doxorubicin, a model antitumor drug, was 
      successfully loaded into the alginic acid nanoparticles, and their in vitro and
      in vivo antitumor activities were evaluated. It was found that these negatively
      charged nanoparticles could be taken up by the cancer cells through an
      endocytosis mechanism. In vivo near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging and
      biodistribution examinations showed that the alginic acid nanoparticles could be 
      well-accumulated in the tumor site by the enhanced permeability and retention
      effect. In vivo antitumor examination showed that the drug-loaded nanoparticles
      have superior efficacy in impeding tumor growth and prolonging the lifetime of
      H22 tumor-bearing mice than free drug.

AB  - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) of breast cancer enabled improved outcomes
      especially in patients with advanced and inflammatory diseases. Biological
      heterogeneity of these tumors, however, requires better molecular
      characterization of the malignant tissue with consequent individualization in the
      selection of appropriate agents. To date, numerous molecular markers have been
      identified, and some of them (e.g., measurement of hormonal or growth factors
      receptors) are already routinely used for breast cancer classification before
      NCT. In the present article, we summarize current knowledge about established as 
      well as promising biomarkers which have demonstrated prognostic or predictive
      value in NCT of breast cancer.

PG  - 630-6
LID - 10.3109/07357907.2012.726385 [doi]
AB  - Investigations concerning the association of Cyclin D1 (CCND1) G870A polymorphism
      with esophageal cancer risk have generated conflicting results. Thus,
      meta-analyses were conducted. The overall data suggest that CCND1 G870A variation
      might have an association with increased esophageal cancer susceptibility. In
      subgroup analyses on ethnicity, homozygous AA alleles might elevate esophageal
      cancer risk among Asians but not Caucasians. In subgroup analysis on histological
      types, no association was found in either the adenocarcinoma or the squamous cell
      carcinoma subgroup. Collectively, results suggest that CCND1 G870A polymorphism
      might be a low-penetrant risk factor for esophageal carcinoma, particularly among
      Asians.

      metastatic breast cancer.
PG  - 435
LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-12-435 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data that directly associate utilization of novel systemic therapies 
      with survival trends in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) are limited. In the
      setting of de novo MBC, large registry analyses cite positive temporal trends in 
      survival, but the extent to which advances in systemic therapy have contributed
      to these gains is not clear. METHODS: The City of Hope Cancer Registry was used
      to identify a consecutive series of patients with de novo MBC who received their 
      first line of therapy between 1985 and 2004. Comprehensive clinicopathologic and 
      treatment-related data were collected for each patient. Univariate analyses were 
      conducted via Cox regression to identify factors associated with improved
      survival. Multivariate analysis was also conducted via Cox regression and the
      stepwise procedure was used to identify independent predictors of survival.
      RESULTS: A total of 324 patients with de novo MBC were identified. After
      application of exclusion criteria, including the sole presence of supraclavicular
      node metastasis, 274 patients were retained in the analysis. The
      treatment-related characteristics associated with improved survival included: use
      of endocrine therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.60, 95%CI 0.47-0.77; P<0.0001), and
      addition of bisphosphonates (HR 0.70, 95%CI 0.52-0.96; P=0.02). However,
      recipients of novel cytotoxic agents (defined as drugs approved for MBC since
      1994) had no improvement in survival relative to patients treated with older
      cytotoxic agents. On multivariate analysis, age (< 50), receipt of aromatase
      inhibitors, and receipt of zoledronic acid were independent predictors of
      survival. CONCLUSIONS: The overall survival of women with de novo metastatic
      breast cancer has improved over the past 20 years. However, the contribution of
      conventional cytotoxic agents to this improvement is minimal.

TI  - Intraoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring: a useful method for patients
      with esophageal cancer.
PG  - 444-51

AB  - It is well accepted that recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis is a severe
      complication of esophagectomy or lymphadenectomy performed adjacent to the
      recurrent laryngeal nerves. Herein, determination of the effectiveness of
      implementing continuous recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring to reduce the
      incidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis after esophagectomy was sought. 
      A total of 115 patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer were enrolled in the
      thoracic section of the Tangdu Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University
      from April 2008 to April 2009. Clinical parameters of patients, the morbidity,
      and the mortality following esophageal resection were recorded and compared.
      After the surgery, a 2-year follow up was completed. It was found that recurrent 
      laryngeal nerve paralysis and postoperative pneumonia were more frequently
      diagnosed in the patients that did not receive continuous recurrent laryngeal
      nerve monitoring (6/61 vs. 0/54). Furthermore, positive mediastinal lymph nodes
      (P = 0.015), total mediastinal lymph nodes (P < 0.001), positive total lymph
      nodes (P = 0.027), and total lymph nodes (P < 0.001) were more often surgically
      removed in the patients with continuous recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring.
      These patients also had a higher 2-year survival rate (P = 0.038) after surgery. 
      It was concluded that continuous intraoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve
      monitoring is technically safe and effectively identifies the recurrent laryngeal
      nerves. This may be a helpful method for decreasing the incidence of recurrent
      laryngeal nerve paralysis and postoperative pneumonia, and for improving the
      efficiency of lymphadenectomy.

      esophagus.
PG  - 505-10

AB  - Current guidelines for endoscopic surveillance of Barrett's esophagus (BE)
      recommend that patients with newly diagnosed BE undergo confirmatory
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to exclude the presence of dysplasia. The extent
      to which confirmatory endoscopy alters management and detects missed dysplasia in
      newly diagnosed BE has not been reported. The frequency with which confirmatory
      endoscopy changed surveillance management in patients with newly diagnosed BE was
      assessed. A two center cohort analysis was conducted on patients newly diagnosed 
      with BE. The rate of dysplasia on confirmatory endoscopy for patients who had
      nondysplastic BE was obtained. Demographic and endoscopic variables were assessed
      for association with dysplasia detection using Firth logistic regression model.
      Out of the 146 patients newly diagnosed with BE and initially determined to be
      without dysplasia, 12 had dysplasia on the confirmatory second EGD (8.2%). Eleven
      of 12 cases with dysplasia on confirmatory endoscopy had long-segment BE (LSBE). 
      Among all the LSBE cases in our cohort, 11 had newly diagnosed dysplasia on
      confirmatory EGD, 29.7% (11/37). The average number of biopsies obtained from the
      11 LSBE cases with dysplasia was comparable with the rest of the LSBE cases
      without dysplasia (6.73 and 5.42, respectively, P-value 0.205). The rate of
      dysplasia detection in short-segment BE (SSBE) was much lower, 0.95% (1 out of
      105). There were no cases of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or cancer detected in any
      SSBE case. HGD was detected on confirmatory EGD in two cases, both were LSBE.
      Segment length was the only statistically significant factor to predict the
      presence of dysplasia on confirmatory endoscopy (odds ratio 9.158, P. 0.008).
      Confirmatory EGD in newly diagnosed LSBE had significant rate of dysplasia
      detection (29.7%) in this cohort. Among patients with SSBE, there was a low rate 
      of dysplasia detection with confirmatory EGD, less than 1% of cases. No
      additional cases of HGD or esophageal carcinoma in SSBE cases were detected. This
      suggests that the yield of confirmatory EGD is greater in patients with LSBE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) are critical lesions produced by
      several cancer chemotherapy agents including platinum drugs and nitrogen
      mustards. We have previously shown in haematological (multiple myeloma) and solid
      tumours (ovarian cancer) that clinical sensitivity to such agents can result from
      a defect in DNA ICL processing leading to their persistence. Conversely, enhanced
      repair can result in clinical acquired resistance following chemotherapy. The
      repair of ICLs is complex but it is assumed that the 'unhooking' step is common
      to all ICLs. METHODS: Using a modification of the single cell gel electrophoresis
      (Comet) assay we measured the formation and unhooking of melphalan and
      cisplatin-induced ICLs in cell lines and clinical samples. DNA damage response in
      the form of gamma-H2AX foci formation and the formation of RAD51 foci as a marker
      of homologous recombination were also determined. Real-time PCR of 84 genes
      involved in DNA damage signalling pathways was also examined pre- and
      post-treatment. RESULTS: Plasma cells from multiple myeloma patients known to be 
      clinically resistant to melphalan showed significant unhooking of
      melphalan-induced ICLs at 48 hours, but did not unhook cisplatin-induced ICLs. In
      ovarian cancer cells obtained from patients following platinum-based
      chemotherapy, unhooking of cisplatin-induced ICLs was observed at 48 hours, but
      no unhooking of melphalan-induced ICLs. In vitro, A549 cells were proficient at
      unhooking both melphalan and cisplatin-induced ICLs. gamma-H2AX foci formation
      closely followed the formation of ICLs for both drugs, and rapidly declined
      following the peak of formation. RPMI8226 cells unhooked melphalan, but not
      cisplatin-induced ICLs. In these cells, although cross-links form with cisplatin,
      the gamma-H2AX response is weak. In A549 cells, addition of 3nM gemcitabine
      resulted in complete inhibition of cisplatin-induced ICL unhooking but no effect 
      on repair of melphalan ICLs. The RAD51 foci response was both drug and cell line 
      specific. Real time PCR studies highlighted differences in the damage response to
      melphalan and cisplatin following equi-ICL forming doses. CONCLUSIONS: These data
      suggest that the mechanisms by which melphalan and cisplatin-induced ICLs are
      'unhooked' in vitro are distinct, and the mechanisms of clinical acquired
      resistance involving repair of ICLs, are drug specific.

AB  - AIMS: To detect the prognostic significance of tumour budding and its expression 
      of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS
      AND RESULTS: Tumour budding was investigated in 105 patients with NPC by
      immunohistochemistry for pan-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3). The intensity of budding
      correlated strongly with T classification (P=0.008), lymphatic invasion
      (P<0.001), vascular invasion (P=0.029), lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), and
      clinical stage (P=0.010). Univariate analysis revealed that patients with high
      budding grade had poorer survival than those with low grade (P=0.002).
      Multivariate analysis showed that tumour budding was an independent predictor of 
      survival (P=0.001). Furthermore, budding cells showed high-level expression of
      the cancer stem cell (CSC) marker ALDH1. Budding cells with high-level ALDH1
      expression contributed to several aggressive behaviours and poor survival
      (P=0.000). CONCLUSIONS: We describe, for the first time, the presence of tumour
      budding and its correlation with aggressive tumour behaviour and poor patient
      survival in NPC. The degree of tumour budding could be a valuable predictive
      factor in NPC. In addition, we show, also for the first time, that budding cells 
      in NPC might possess the invasive and metastatic properties of CSCs.

TI  - CHD1L protein is overexpressed in human ovarian carcinomas and is a novel
      predictive biomarker for patients survival.
PG  - 437
LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-12-437 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our recent studies suggested that the chromodomain helicase DNA
      binding protein 1-like (CHD1L) gene plays an oncogenic role in human
      hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the status of CHD1L protein expression in
      ovarian cancer and its clinical/prognostic significance are obscure. METHODS: In 
      this study, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CHD1L was performed on a tissue
      microarray (TMA) containing 102 primary ovarian carcinomas and 44 metastatic
      lesions (omental metastasis). Receiver-operator curve (ROC) analysis was used to 
      evaluate patients' survival status. RESULTS: There is an augmented tendency of
      CHD1L expression in ovarian carcinoma metastasis than in primary lesions
      (P<0.05). A significant association was found between positive expression of
      CHD1L and tumors histological type (P <0.05). By univariate survival analysis of 
      the ovarian carcinoma cohorts, positive expression of CHD1L was significantly
      correlated with shortened patient survival (mean 66.7 months versus 97.4 months, 
      P<0.05). Moreover, CHD1L expression was evaluated to be a significant and
      independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
      These findings provide evidence that positive expression of CHD1L protein is
      significantly correlated with the metastasis proceeding of ovarian carcinoma, and
      CHD1L protein expression, as examined by IHC, may act as a novel prognostic
      biomarker for patients with ovarian carcinoma.

TI  - Peritoneal macrophages mediated delivery of chitosan/siRNA nanoparticle to the
      lesion site in a murine radiation-induced fibrosis model.
PG  - 1730-8
LID - 10.3109/0284186X.2012.726373 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF) is a dose-limiting complication of
      cancer radiotherapy and causes serious problems, i.e. restricted tissue
      flexibility, pain, ulceration or necrosis. Recently, we have successfully treated
      RIF in a mouse model by intraperitoneal administration of chitosan/siRNA
      nanoparticles directed towards silencing TNF alpha in local macrophage
      populations, but the mechanism for the therapeutic effect at the lesion site
      remains unclear. METHODS: Using the same murine RIF model we utilized an optical 
      imaging technique and fluorescence microscopy to investigate the uptake of
      chitosan/fluorescently labeled siRNA nanoparticles by peritoneal macrophages and 
      their subsequent migration to the inflamed tissue in the RIF model. RESULTS: We
      observed strong accumulation of the fluorescent signal in the lesion site of the 
      irradiated leg up to 24 hours using the optical imaging system. We further
      confirm by immunohistochemical staining that Cy3 labeled siRNA resides in
      macrophages of the irradiated leg. CONCLUSION: We provide a proof-of-concept for 
      host macrophage trafficking towards the inflamed region in a murine RIF model,
      which thereby suggests that the chitosan/siRNA nanoparticle may constitute a
      general treatment for inflammatory diseases using the natural homing potential of
      macrophages to inflammatory sites.

TI  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment in cancer cachexia: a systematic
      literature review.
PG  - 6-17
LID - 10.3109/0284186X.2012.724536 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no established treatments for cachexia. Recently it has
      been suggested that the evidence for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID)
      treatment is sufficient to support its regular clinical use. Primary objective in
      this systematic review was to assess efficacy and safety of NSAID treatment in
      improving body weight and muscle mass in patients with cancer cachexia. Secondary
      objectives were to assess whether this treatment could improve other cachexia
      domains such as anorexia and food intake, catabolic drive and function. MATERIAL 
      AND METHODS: A systematic literature review of PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane
      Central register of controlled trials database was carried out using both text
      words and MeSH/EMTREE terms. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included; all but two
      trials showed either improvement or stabilization in weight or lean body mass.
      Seven studies were without a comparator. Studies are generally small and a few
      are methodologically flawed, often due to multiple outcomes with excess risk of
      false positives. CONCLUSION: NSAIDs may improve weight in cancer patients with
      cachexia, and there is some evidence on effect on physical performance,
      self-reported quality of life and inflammatory parameters. Evidence is too frail 
      to recommend NSAID for cachexia outside clinical trials. This is supported by the
      known side effects of NSAIDs, even though the reviewed literature report almost
      negligible toxicity.

TI  - Sudden suffocation with cancer of unknown primary: a case report and review of
      diagnostic approach.
PG  - 652-4
AB  - A case of a 31-year-old woman with sudden respiratory distress is presented.
      Preliminary evaluations and imaging studies did not reveal the underlying cause. 
      Workup during hospital stay showed advanced metastatic cancer of unknown primary 
      origin. This is an unusual presentation of cancer of an unknown primary involving
      the thyroid with sudden suffocation. It suggests that malignancies involving the 
      thyroid gland should be considered in patients with abrupt onset of respiratory
      distress. Also, this case shows the application of fine needle aspiration in
      diffuse thyroid enlargements mimicking thyroiditis without nodules. Diagnostic
      approach to cancer of unknown primary origin (CUP) is reviewed in further detail.

TI  - Complex carriers of affibody-displaying bio-nanocapsules and composition-varied
      liposomes for HER2-expressing breast cancer cell-specific protein delivery.
PG  - 897-905
LID - 10.3109/1061186X.2012.725404 [doi]
AB  - A bio-nanocapsule (BNC), a hollow particle composed of hepatitis B virus (HBV)
      surface antigen (HBsAg), and liposome (LP) conjugation method (BNC/LP) has been
      recently developed by Jung et al. (2008) . The BNC/LP complex carrier could
      successfully deliver fluorescence-labeled beads (100 nm) into liver cells. In
      this study, we report the promising delivery of proteins incorporated in the
      complex carriers, which were prepared by the BNC/LP conjugation method with
      specificity-altered BNC and composition-varied LPs. The specificity-altered BNC, 
      Z(HER2)-BNC was developed by replacing the hepatocyte recognition site of BNC
      with Z(HER2) binding to HER2 receptor specifically. Using green fluorescent
      protein (GFP; 27 kDa) and cellular cytotoxic protein (exotoxin A; 66 kDa) for the
      delivery, we herein present the impact of different charges attributed to the
      composition of the LP on specific cell targeting and cellular uptake of the
      complex carriers. In addition, we demonstrate that the mixture prepared by mixing
      LPs with helper lipid possessing endosomal escaping ability boosts the functional
      expression of the cellular cytotoxic exotoxin A activity specifically. Finally,
      we further show the blending ratio of the LP mixture and Z(HER2)-BNC is a
      critical factor in determining the highly-efficient expression of the cytotoxic
      activity of exotoxin A.

TI  - Skin toxicity and quality of life in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
      during first-line panitumumab plus FOLFIRI treatment in a single-arm phase II
      study.
PG  - 438
LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-12-438 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Integument-related toxicities are common during epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy. Panitumumab is a fully human monoclonal 
      antibody targeting the EGFR that significantly improves progression-free survival
      when added to chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have
      wild-type (WT) KRAS tumours. Primary efficacy and tolerability results from a
      phase II single-arm study of first-line panitumumab plus FOLFIRI in patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer have been reported. Here we report additional
      descriptive tolerability and quality of life data from this trial. METHODS:
      Integument-related toxicities and quality of life were analysed; toxicities were 
      graded using modified National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria.
      Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to and duration of first integument-related
      toxicity were prepared. Quality of life was measured using EuroQoL EQ-5D and
      EORTC QLQ-C30. Best overall response was analysed by skin toxicity grade and
      baseline quality of life. Change in quality of life was analysed by skin toxicity
      severity. RESULTS: 154 patients were enrolled (WT KRAS n = 86; mutant KRAS n =
      59); most (98%) experienced integument-related toxicities (most commonly rash
      [42%], dry skin [40%] and acne [36%]). Median time to first integument-related
      toxicity was 8 days; median duration was 334 days. Overall, proportionally more
      patients with grade 2+ skin toxicity responded (56%) compared with those with
      grade 0/1 (29%). Mean overall EQ-5D health state index scores (0.81 vs. 0.78),
      health rating scores (72.5 vs. 71.0) and QLQ-C30 global health status scores
      (65.8 vs. 66.7) were comparable at baseline vs. safety follow-up (8 weeks after
      completion), respectively and appeared unaffected by skin toxicity severity.
      CONCLUSIONS: First-line panitumumab plus FOLFIRI has acceptable tolerability and 
      appears to have little impact on quality of life, despite the high incidence of
      integument-related toxicity. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00508404.

AB  - PRKCDBP is a putative tumor suppressor located at 11p15.4, where frequent genomic
      loss has been observed in human cancers. We explored the possible association
      between an intra-exonic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs1051992, that
      results in a Leu to Pro substitution, and risk for endometrial carcinogenesis. We
      assessed the genotype of rs1051992 in endometrial cancer tissues from 147
      patients and normal endometrial tissue from 191 healthy individuals by
      restriction endonuclease PvuII-based genotyping. Allele frequencies in the cancer
      specimens were compared with those in the healthy controls. We also evaluated the
      association between polymorphisms at this locus and histopathological features of
      endometrial cancer.

TI  - Effects of spiritual healing for women undergoing long-term hormone therapy for
      breast cancer: a qualitative investigation.
PG  - 211-6
LID - 10.1089/acm.2012.0091 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spiritual Healing is widely available and used, but is a neglected
      area for research and its biologic and psychologic mechanisms are not understood.
      The side-effects of long-term hormonal therapy for breast cancer are onerous and 
      have been reported to lead to "drug holidays" that could diminish the long-term
      treatment benefits. It was investigated whether Spiritual Healing could support
      patients with breast cancer undergoing this treatment. METHODS: The qualitative
      observation study took place in a specialist research facility in a general
      hospital. Spiritual Healing was provided by 4 healers registered with the
      National Federation of Spiritual Healers. Twelve (12) patients with breast cancer
      undergoing long-term hormone treatment and who found the effects onerous,
      self-referred themselves and were given ten weekly sessions of approximately 40
      minutes each. Data collected included participant's daily records, direct
      observations noted by healers, the researcher's field diary and a one-to-one
      semi-structured interview. FINDINGS: The positive effects of Spiritual Healing
      included alleviation of the physical side-effects of their treatment, increased
      energy levels, enhanced well-being, emotional relaxation, and re-engagement with 
      precancer activities. Although 1 participant admitted considering a drug holiday 
      prior to joining the study, none of the participants felt tempted to stop their
      hormonal treatments while receiving Spiritual Healing. CONCLUSIONS: These
      qualitative findings indicate that Spiritual Healing has the potential to support
      patients with breast cancer in the maintenance of their long-term orthodox
      treatments. Further research is needed to test Spiritual Healing as a
      cost-effective complementary therapy, for those undergoing long-term cancer
      treatments.

LID - 10.3109/07357907.2012.721038 [doi]
AB  - The immunosuppressive functions of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)
      may give cancer cells a survival advantage. This study tests the hypothesis that 
      MSCs protect leukemia cells from immune clearance. Our results demonstrate that
      MSCs are capable of inhibiting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs)
      proliferation and their migration toward leukemic cells by the reduction of CCL5 
      and CXCL12. In addition, we find that MSCs can inhibit the cytolytic functions of
      NK-cells and CTLs. TGF-beta1 secreted by MSCs is responsible for impaired CTLs
      and NK function by down-modulating surface NKG2D expression. These inhibitory
      functions of MSCs have negative effects on the CTLs or NK-mediated
      graft-versus-leukemia (GVL), particularly in the allogeneic hematopoietic stem
      cells transplantation setting.

AB  - In the present study, 1-acetyl-3-(2-thienyl)-5-aryl-2-pyrazoline derivatives
      (1-6) were synthesized via the ring closure reaction of
      1-(2-thienyl)-3-aryl-2-propen-1-ones with hydrazine hydrate in acetic acid. The
      chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by IR, (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR
      and mass spectral data and elemental analyses. MTT assay, analysis of DNA
      synthesis and caspase-3 activation assay were carried out to determine anticancer
      effects of the compounds on A549 and C6 cancer cell lines. They exhibited
      dose-dependent anticancer activity against A549 and C6 cancer cell lines.
      Anticancer activity screening results revealed that compounds 1, 2 and 4 were the
      most potent derivatives among these compounds. But anticancer effects of these
      compounds may result from different death mechanisms in A549 and C6 cell lines.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Pancreatitis and cholecystitis are major complications after 
      self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) placement in distal malignant biliary
      obstruction. We aimed to clarify predictive factors for pancreatitis and
      cholecystitis after covered SEMS placement. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 
      74 consecutive patients with distal malignant biliary obstruction who underwent
      initial endoscopic drainage using covered SEMS. Predictive factors for
      pancreatitis and cholecystitis were evaluated in the 74 patients described above 
      and in 66 patients who had not undergone cholecystectomy. RESULTS: The incidences
      of pancreatitis and cholecystitis were 10.8% (8/74) and 6.1% (4/66),
      respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that non-pancreatic cancer (P = 0.018)
      and contrast injection into the pancreatic duct (P = 0.030) were significant
      predictive factors for pancreatitis. Multivariate analysis revealed that
      non-pancreatic cancer (odds ratio [OR], 4.21; 95% confidence interval [CI],
      1.63-14.18; P = 0.007) and contrast injection into the pancreatic duct (OR, 3.34;
      95% CI, 1.33-9.60; P = 0.016) were significant independent predictive factors for
      pancreatitis. On the other hand, univariate and multivariate analyses revealed
      that tumor involvement to the orifice of the cystic duct (OCD) was a significant 
      independent predictive factor for cholecystitis (OR, 5.85; 95% CI, 1.91-27.74; P 
      = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Non-pancreatic cancer and contrast injection into the
      pancreatic duct were predictive factors for pancreatitis, and tumor involvement
      to the OCD was a positive predictive factor for cholecystitis after endoscopic
      covered SEMS placement for distal malignant biliary obstruction.

AB  - AIMS: The anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) has attracted considerable
      attention as a potential molecular target in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
      However, it is unclear whether ALK alterations are acquired during the metastatic
      progression of NSCLC. METHODS AND RESULTS: ALK status and ALK expression were
      evaluated in a series of 67 primary NSCLCs and their corresponding metastatic
      lesions using fluorescence in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. ALK
      rearrangement was detected in 7.5% (5/67) of the primary tumours and in 9.0%
      (6/67) of the metastases (P < 0.001). ALK copy number gain (CNG) was detected in 
      1.5% (1/67) of the primary tumours and in 35.8% (24/67) of the metastases.
      Whereas ALK rearrangement was detected only in adenocarcinomas, CNG was
      identified in various histological subtypes of NSCLC. ALK expression was detected
      in 11.9% (8/67) of the primary tumours and in 25.4% (17/67) of the metastatic
      lesions. CONCLUSIONS: ALK alteration and ALK expression can be acquired during
      metastatic progression in NSCLC, and ALK CNG is associated with ALK expression.

TI  - Classification of lung cancer: proposals for change?
PG  - 1190-3
AB  - Clinical need and developments in pathology and molecular biology require our
      cancer classifications to be constantly updated to keep them relevant and useful.
      A review of lung cancer classification is due and has been initiated with new
      proposals on classification of lung adenocarcinoma. Other major lung cancer types
      also deserve a similar consideration. As well as addressing the categories of
      tumor, as signed out in surgical resection specimens, recent proposals on small
      diagnostic-sample reporting would be an important addition to any new
      classification. The huge increase in data on the molecular biology of lung cancer
      has improved our understanding of these diseases, has driven improved therapy for
      some patients, and must be reflected in the way lung cancer is classified.

PG  - 1201-4
AB  - Crizotinib (Xalkori), the first inhibitor of both anaplastic lymphoma kinase
      (ALK) and c-Met receptor kinases, has been approved in the United States, Korea, 
      and other countries for the treatment of ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer 
      (NSCLC). This approval came within just 4 years of the discovery of
      rearrangements in the ALK gene in a subset of patients with NSCLC. Oral
      crizotinib 250 mg twice daily showed excellent efficacy in patients with advanced
      ALK-positive NSCLC, with objective response rates of 61% and 51% in ongoing phase
      I and II studies, respectively. Objective response rates of current standard,
      single-agent, second-line therapies are less than 10%. Median progression-free
      survival was 10 months (95% confidence interval, 8.2-14.7) in the phase I study
      expanded cohort and has yet to be reached in the phase II study; progression-free
      survival with current therapies is less than 3 months. Crizotinib was well
      tolerated; grade 1/2 gastrointestinal toxicity and visual disturbances were the
      most common adverse events. Patients in the phase II study reported improvements 
      in fatigue, dyspnea, and cough, based on quality of life assessments. Phase III
      studies investigating crizotinib for the first- and second-line treatment of
      advanced ALK-positive NSCLC, versus current standards of care, are ongoing.
      Crizotinib represents a new standard of care for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC
      and highlights the importance of the role of the pathologist, as molecular
      profiling becomes a part of initial workups for newly diagnosed patients with
      NSCLC. This approach will ensure effective individualized treatment for patients 
      with NSCLC.

      cancer patients treated with platinum/5-Fu-based chemotherapy: a systematic
      review.
PG  - 137
LID - 10.1186/1471-230X-12-137 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite genetic polymorphism in response to platinum/5-Fu
      chemotherapy in gastric cancer (GC) has been studied, data reported so far are
      conflicting and critical consideration is needed before translation to the
      treatment of GC. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis by using 20 eligible
      studies to examine polymorphisms of ERCC1, GSTs, TS and MTHFR in predicting
      clinical outcomes (response rate, overall survival and toxicity) of GC patients
      treated with platinum/5-Fu-based chemotherapy. The association was measured using
      random/fixed effect odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) combined with their 
      95% confidence intervals (CIs) according to the studies' heterogeneity.
      Statistical analysis was performed with the software STATA 9.0 package. RESULTS: 
      No significant association was found between response rate and genetic
      polymorphism in TS, MTHFR, ERCC1, GSTM1 and GSTP1. However, response rate was
      higher in GSTT1 (+) genotype compared with GSTT1 (-) genotype (T-/T+: OR=0.67,
      95% CI: 0.47-0.97). With regard to long term outcomes, we could observe a
      significant longer overall survival in TS 3R/3R [(2R2R+2R3R)/3R3R: HR=1.29, 95%
      CI: 1.02-1.64] and GSTP1 GG/GA [(GG+AG)/AA: HR=0.51, 95% CI: (0.39, 0.67)]
      genotypes. In addition, significant association was demonstrated between toxicity
      and genetic polymorphism in TS, MTHFR and GSTP1 in included studies. CONCLUSION: 
      Polymorphisms of ERCC1, GSTs, TS and MTHFR were closely associated with clinical 
      outcomes of GC patients treated with platinum/5-Fu-based chemotherapy. Studies
      with large sample size using the method of multi-variant analyses may help us to 
      give more persuasive data on the putative association in future.

TI  - Oral availability and brain penetration of the B-RAFV600E inhibitor vemurafenib
      can be enhanced by the P-GLYCOprotein (ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance
      protein (ABCG2) inhibitor elacridar.

AB  - Vemurafenib (PLX4032) is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has clinical
      efficacy against metastatic melanoma harboring a BRAF(V600E) mutation. We aimed
      to establish whether oral availability and brain penetration of vemurafenib could
      be restricted by the multidrug efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1)
      and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2), as these might limit
      therapeutic efficacy, especially against brain metastases. In vitro, vemurafenib 
      was efficiently transported by both human ABCB1 and ABCG2, and very efficiently
      by mouse Abcg2, but not by mouse Abcc2. Upon oral administration of vemurafenib
      (5 mg/kg), Abcb1a/1b(-/-) mice had a 1.6-fold increased, Abcg2(-/-) mice a
      2.3-fold increased, and Abcb1a/1b(-/-);Abcg2(-/-) mice a 6.6-fold increased
      plasma AUC, respectively, compared to wild-type (WT) mice, indicating a marked
      and additive role of these transporters in limiting vemurafenib oral
      availability. Brain-to-plasma ratios of vemurafenib (oral, 25 mg/kg) were not
      increased in Abcg2(-/-) mice, only 1.7-fold in Abcb1a/1b(-/-) mice, but 21.4-fold
      in Abcb1a/1b(-/-);Abcg2(-/-) mice, indicating pronounced overlapping functions of
      these transporters in reducing vemurafenib brain accumulation. Oral
      coadministration of the dual ABCB1 and ABCG2 inhibitor elacridar almost
      completely eliminated the roles of Abcb1 and Abcg2 in restricting oral
      availability and brain accumulation of vemurafenib. As predicted by previously
      described pharmacokinetic modeling, halving the amount of active efflux transport
      at the WT blood-brain barrier by testing heterozygous Abcb1a/1b(+/-);Abcg2(+/-)
      mice had little impact on vemurafenib brain accumulation. Our data suggest that
      elacridar coadministration may be considered to improve the therapeutic efficacy 
      of vemurafenib, especially for brain metastases located behind a functional
      blood-brain barrier.

AB  - Suppression of gonadal androgens by medical or surgical castration remains the
      mainstay of treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer. However, the
      response to treatment is not durable, and transition to a "castration-resistant" 
      state is invariable. Recent advances in our understanding of the androgen
      receptor signaling pathway have led to the development of therapeutic strategies 
      to overcome castration resistance. This article reviews current concepts and
      challenges behind targeting continued androgen receptor signaling in
      castration-resistant prostate cancer and provides an overview of recently
      completed and ongoing clinical trials of novel hormonal agents, with a focus on
      abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide (MDV3100).

PG  - 131-44
LID - 10.1146/annurev-med-112211-154330 [doi]
AB  - A large body of evidence indicates that genetic mutations, epigenetic changes,
      chronic inflammation, diet, and lifestyle are key risk factors for colorectal
      cancer (CRC). Prevention of CRC has long been considered a plausible approach for
      the population and individuals at high risk for developing this disease. A
      significant effort has been made in the development of novel drugs for both
      prevention and treatment over the past two decades. This review highlights recent
      advances in our understanding of the role of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      in CRC prevention and adjuvant treatment. Moreover, we focus on the molecular
      mechanisms underlying the antitumor effects of these drugs in CRC. The knowledge 
      of how anti-inflammatory agents inhibit cancer formation and progression may
      provide a rationale for the development of more effective chemopreventive and
      chemotherapeutic agents with less toxicity.

PG  - 119-29
LID - 10.1146/annurev-med-052511-135500 [doi]
AB  - Determining whether cancer has spread to locoregional lymph nodes is a critical
      step in the initial staging of breast cancer patients. Although axillary
      dissection reliably identifies nodal metastases and prevents the recurrence of
      cancer in the axilla, there is a significant incidence of long-term side effects,
      notably lymphedema, and the procedure is of no therapeutic benefit in women
      without axillary metastases. With the advent of sentinel lymph node biopsy, the
      axilla can be accurately staged in patients with T1-T3, clinically node-negative 
      breast cancers while avoiding the morbidity of axillary lymph node dissection if 
      the nodes do not contain cancer. Recent clinical trials suggest that for women
      with metastases to 1 or 2 sentinel nodes, the radiation and systemic therapy that
      are part of modern multimodality breast cancer treatment can replace axillary
      dissection when breast-conserving therapy is undertaken. For those with greater
      disease burden or those undergoing mastectomy, axillary dissection remains
      standard management.

TI  - Prognostic prediction following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer using
      conventional as well as molecular biological approaches.
PG  - 301-11
LID - 10.1111/j.1442-2042.2012.03175.x [doi]
AB  - Although radical prostatectomy has been the mainstay of treatment for men with
      clinically organ-confined prostate cancer, a certain proportion of men undergoing
      radical prostatectomy fail to achieve a complete cure of this disease; that is,
      postoperative biochemical recurrence develops in approximately 30% of men, some
      of whom will ultimately die of disease progression. A number of studies,
      therefore, have been carried out to identify factors reflecting prognostic
      outcomes following radical prostatectomy, which would be potentially helpful for 
      properly counseling individual patients undergoing this surgery. Furthermore,
      various types of model systems using multiple clinicopathological parameters,
      such as the nomogram, look-up table and artificial neural network, have been
      shown to have better performance in postoperative prognostic prediction than the 
      opinions of expert clinicians. However, there have not been any standard models
      uniformly applied to postoperative prognostic prediction, which could be
      explained, at least in part, by the use of conventional clinicopathological
      parameters alone, suggesting the need for the additional evaluation of molecular 
      markers simultaneously considering the unique biological features of prostate
      cancer. In this review, a search of the literature was carried out focusing on
      the significance of prognostic models following radical prostatectomy, and it is 
      suggested that these models could be promising tools to provide accurate
      information on the postoperative clinical course of prostate cancer patients. To 
      widely introduce such models into clinical practice, it is necessary to further
      improve currently available models and develop more reliable, flexible, simple
      and easily accessible tools by incorporating conventional clinicopathological
      factors as well as molecular biomarkers.

      diagnosis of prostate cancer.

LID - 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2012.11501.x [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? The use of 
      biomarkers to detect a cancer early, especially prostate cancer, is not a new
      idea and PSA has been proved to be the best biomarker for the early diagnosis of 
      prostate cancer. Since the introduction and wide use of PSA various efforts have 
      been made to find novel biomarkers in both serum and urine of individuals at high
      risk for prostate cancer. The best example of a biomarker detected in the urine
      after a vigorous digital rectal examination is PCA3, which is used mainly in the 
      subgroup of patients with PSA 4-10 ng/mL whose prostate biopsy was repeatedly
      negative for prostate cancer in order to decide the performance or not of a new
      biopsy. Proteomics is a state of the art new biotechnology used to identify the
      proteome of a certain tissue meaning the whole group of proteins related to the
      anatomy and biochemistry of the tissue. Using proteomics can effectively and more
      specifically identify proteins that can be used as potential biomarkers for the
      early diagnosis of prostate cancer. Zinc alpha2-glycoprotein has been studied in 
      the past as a protein related to cancer cachexia and it has been measured in both
      prostate tissue and serum in patients with prostate cancer. Zinc
      alpha2-glycoprotein has also been recently identified by proteomics in prostate
      tissue showing different values in patients with prostate cancer and benign
      prostate hyperplasia. It is the first time that zinc alpha2-glycoprotein has been
      systematically measured and studied in an easily obtained biological fluid such
      as urine showing a very optimistic potential both as a novel solo biomarker and
      as an adjunct to PSA for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. PSA has
      revolutionized the way we approximate prostate cancer diagnosis. Even though PSA 
      is still the best biomarker for the diagnosis of prostate cancer it constitutes
      an organ-specific and not a disease-specific biomarker and diagnostic dilemmas
      are often raised concerning the performance or not of a prostate biopsy. Thus
      novel biomarkers are required in order to improve the diagnostic ability of PSA. 
      Increasingly in the literature it is stated that the future of prostate cancer
      diagnosis could be not a single biomarker but a band of different biomarkers that
      as a total could give the possibility of an individual having prostate cancer. By
      detecting and measuring zinc alpha2-glycoprotein in the urine we believe that
      interesting conclusions can be made: first that proteomics is the way to detect
      with accuracy proteins that could be proved to be valuable novel biomarkers;
      second that zinc alpha2-glycoprotein detected in the urine could be used both as 
      a solo biomarker and as an adjunct to PSA for the early diagnosis of prostate
      cancer. OBJECTIVE: * To examine the potential utility as a novel biomarker in the
      urine of zinc alpha2-glygoprotein (ZAG) for the early diagnosis of prostate
      cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: * The urine of 127 consecutive candidates for a
      transrectal ultrasound prostatic biopsy with a mean age of 65.7 +/- 8.7 years and
      mean PSA 9.1 +/- 5.3 ng/mL was collected. * Western blot analysis and
      immunohistochemistry for ZAG were performed. * Receiver operating characteristic 
      curves and logistic regression models were used to estimate the predictive
      ability of ZAG and to determine the optimal sensitivity and specificity by using 
      various cut-off values for the prediction of prostate cancer. RESULTS: * In all, 
      42 patients had prostate cancer, 29 showed high grade prostatic intraepithelial
      neoplasia and 56 were negative. * Receiver operating characteristic curve
      analysis showed a significant predictive ability of ZAG for prostate cancer. The 
      area under the curve (AUC) for the prediction of prostate cancer was 0.68 (95% CI
      0.59-0.78). * The combination of ZAG with PSA showed a significant improvement in
      the predictive ability (P= 0.010), with AUC equal to 0.75 (95% CI 0.66-0.85).
      Separate analysis in patients with PSA levels of 4-10 ng/mL (70.1%) showed that
      ZAG had a discriminative power with AUC equal to 0.68. * The optimal cut-off was 
      1.13 for ZAG, which corresponded to 6.88 times greater odds for prostate cancer. 
      CONCLUSIONS: * Urine detected ZAG showed promising results in the prediction of
      prostate cancer. * Further validation is required to establish ZAG as a novel
      biomarker.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome has been increasing worldwide,
      however its association with prostate cancer (CaP) is unclear. We reviewed
      patients undergoing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) to evaluate if
      those with metabolic syndrome had more aggressive disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      A prospective database of patients undergoing RARP between January 2005 and
      December 2008 (n = 2756) was queried for components of metabolic syndrome (BMI
      >/= 30 and >/= 2 of the following: hypertension, diabetes or elevated blood
      glucose, and dyslipidemia; n = 357). Patients with no components of metabolic
      syndrome were used as controls (n = 694). Biopsy and final pathology were
      compared between the 2 groups using all controls, and using best-matched controls
      (n = 357) based on greedy matching by propensity score. RESULTS: Compared with
      unmatched controls, metabolic syndrome patients had higher pathology Gleason
      grade (>/= 7: 78% vs. 64%, P < 0.001) and higher pathologic stage (>/= T3
      disease: 43% vs. 31%, P < 0.001). After controlling for confounders, those with
      metabolic syndrome when compared with best-matched controls had maintained the
      greater pathology Gleason grade (>/= 7: 78% vs. 64%, P < 0.001) and pathologic
      stage (>/= T3 disease: 43% vs. 32%, P < 0.001). They also had significantly
      greater pathologic upgrading of Gleason grade 6 adenocarcinoma found on biopsy
      compared with best-matched controls (63% vs. 45%, P < 0.001). On pathology, a
      2-fold increase in Gleason 8 and greater was noted between patients with
      metabolic syndrome and best-matched controls (15% vs. 8%). CONCLUSIONS: After
      controlling for confounders, patients with metabolic syndrome were found to have 
      higher Gleason grade and tumor stage on final pathology and were more likely to
      have upgrading.

TI  - Neoplastic severe central airways obstruction, interventional bronchoscopy: a
      decision-making analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cancer can involve the airways, causing various degrees of
      obstruction. Usually, after days or months of mild to moderate undervalued
      symptoms, severe dyspnea arises abruptly, imposing an immediate attempt to
      restore the airflow regardless of the etiology. This study focuses on the
      development of a predictive preintervention model that is useful when deciding
      whether to perform therapeutic interventional bronchoscopy in patients with
      severe central airway obstruction. METHODS: A total of 804 patients who underwent
      rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia to treat severe neoplastic central
      airway obstruction from 1990 to 2009 were studied. Electronic records for
      patients who underwent bronchoscopy were analyzed. The patients were primarily
      male (n = 618, 76.9%) and the median age was 62 years. Lung cancer was the most
      frequent cause of neoplastic airway obstruction (n = 645, 81.65%). An estimate of
      the probability of individual endoscopic success was made. RESULTS: Of the 804
      patients with severe neoplastic airway obstruction, 681 (84.7%) achieved luminal 
      clearance, and the procedure was considered an endoscopic success. Tracheal
      involvement (rate ratio, 1.21; range, 1.16-1.27) endoluminal mass (rate ratio,
      1.13; range, 1.06-1.12), and extrinsic compression (rate ratio, 1.17; 1.11-1.17) 
      were associated significantly with a favorable endoscopic outcome. Tumor location
      and any kind of mucosal infiltration were the main determinants of the predictive
      preoperative model of intervention success. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic
      characteristics and location of the neoplastic lesions are the major determinants
      of patients' endoscopic outcome. The preintervention model adds to the clinical
      evaluation an important contribution to the decision-making process on performing
      therapeutic interventional bronchoscopy in a critical setting.
